What about me?". Mommy smiled and said, "I love you both the same. Just sit next to Lily and I\'ll hug you both". So Lily and Jack stayed there, cuddled up together and Mommy hugged them both.']

The boy never forgot the lesson he learned that day - even the youngest creatures can bite!']

She would blow and blow until she made a big, beautiful bubble. The bug enjoyed the petal very much and went on its way.

He gave me my family and my friends. He gave me my voice and my songs. I want to thank him too. Can you teach me a song?" The angel says, "Of course. Listen to me and repeat after me." They sing together, louder and louder. Lily feels warm and peaceful. She thinks, "This is the best dream ever." and ', ": Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Timmy who loved to play with his toys. One day, he found a big cabinet in his house. He opened it and saw a lot of colorful jars inside. Timmy wanted to touch them, but his mom told him to be careful. Timmy tried to be careful, but he accidentally knocked over one of the jars. It made a loud sound and his mom came running. Timmy felt sad and wished he had been more careful. The lesson Timmy learned was to always listen to his mom and be careful.Timmy and Lily's stories seem to intertwine in this dream sequence, with Lily's singing and encounter with an angel inspiring Timmy to be more careful in his actions. However, the original texts likely did not contain this connection, so it is impossible to determine exactly how they should be separated without additional context. The provided interleaved text suggests that  may have been intended to be read separately, as they do not flow smoothly when combined in the given order."]

Every night, they would go outside with their dad and point at the different shapes and colors in the sky. One night, their dad told them something special was going to happen. He said a comet was coming, and it would be very bright and fast. A comet is like a big ball of ice and dust that flies around the sun. They needed to get their coats, hats, gloves, and blankets, because it will be very cold outside. They also needed to get their binoculars, so they could see the comet better. And they needed to find a good spot, where there were no lights or trees to block their view.']
Extract: [': Once upon a time, there was a kangaroo named Joey. Joey was a big kangaroo who liked to hop and play all day. One day, Joey got lost in the forest and he was confused. He sat down and started to plan. Sometimes, we can see it from the earth when it gets close enough. He thought about the way he came and tried to remember the trees and bushes he saw. It has a long tail that glows in the dark.', ': Tom and Lily were twins who loved to look at the stars.
