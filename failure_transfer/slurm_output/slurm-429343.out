Paragraph1: : Once upon a time, there was a chubby little girl named Daisy. Daisy loved her mummy and daddy very much and spent every day playing with them. One day, while playing in the garden, Daisy found a beautiful crystal lying in the grass. It was shiny, white, and smooth. Daisy was so excited about her discovery that she wanted to keep it for herself.
Paragraph2: : There was once a fancy piano, shiny, white, and smooth, that begged to be tickled and played. However, when Daisy returned home with her crystal, she found that someone had disturbed the living room. The piano was in the midst of chaos, and her parents were nowhere to be found. Poor Daisy was scared and cried when she saw two robbers returning to the house. The crystal's loud noise when it hit the ground made the robbers angry, and they chased Daisy out of the house. Her parents were devastated when they realized she was gone, and her chubby little face never returned to the house again.: The fancy piano was a source of joy and competition for two siblings. The older brother would tease his little sister, saying he would only let her play if she played a certain song. She would huff and puff but eventually figure it out and play it perfectly. Then, he would cheer, "You did it!" At other times, the brother would tell his little sister that only he knew how to play the piano. She could try, of course, but he was the only one with the talent. He would play his fingers across the keys, showing off his skill. The little sister might pout, but eventually, she would join in, playing a song as brilliant as her brother's. They would pause, then laugh and clap each other's hands. In the end, no one ever tired of playing the fancy piano, and it brought the brother and sister closer together each day.

The moral of the story is that it's better to work together and be friends than to be bossy and argue. The girl nodded and the librarian said, "That's great! You can learn so much from reading history books." The girl smiled and took the book home. She read the book every day, and soon she knew a lot of facts about the past. The girl was very proud when she showed her parents what she had learned from reading history. Her parents smiled and said, "You're so clever!" She felt so proud - she had achieved something all by herself, even though she was deaf!
