|INFO|2024-02-29 15:53:39| Original: It was not until after the 5th century CE that the Mahayana sutras started to influence the behavior of mainstream Buddhists in India: "But outside of texts, at least in India, at exactly the same period, very different—in fact seemingly older—ideas and aspirations appear to be motivating actual behavior, and old and established Hinnayana groups appear to be the only ones that are patronized and supported."; Translated: A long time ago, after the year 500, some special Buddhist stories called Mahayana sutras began to change how most Buddhists in India acted. But even though these stories were important, it looks like people were still following older ideas and doing things the old way. The groups that liked the older Buddhist ways were the ones that got help and support from others.
