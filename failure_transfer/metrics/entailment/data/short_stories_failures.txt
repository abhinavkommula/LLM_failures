('Architecturally, the school has a Catholic character. Atop the Main Building\'s gold dome is a golden statue of the Virgin Mary. Immediately in front of the Main Building and facing it, is a copper statue of Christ with arms upraised with the legend "Venite Ad Me Omnes". Next to the Main Building is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Immediately behind the basilica is the Grotto, a Marian place of prayer and reflection. It is a replica of the grotto at Lourdes, France where the Virgin Mary reputedly appeared to Saint Bernadette Soubirous in 1858. At the end of the main drive (and in a direct line that connects through 3 statues and the Gold Dome), is a simple, modern stone statue of Mary.', " The intricate blend of religious symbols and architectural elements at the school continues beyond the main building. To the left of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, there is a peaceful garden dedicated to the Stations of the Cross. Each station features a sculpture depicting a scene from the Passion of Christ. The garden serves as a tranquil space for students and visitors to contemplate and reflect on the spiritual journey of faith. Additionally, the school's chapel, located near the athletic fields, is a beautiful and serene space for daily Mass and private prayer. Its stained glass windows depict various saints and scenes from the Bible, adding to the overall Catholic character of the school.", 7)
("As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.", ' With the diverse range of student-run media outlets at Notre Dame, it is no surprise that the campus community remains engaged in lively discourse and debate on various issues. The existence of independent publications like The Observer, Common Sense, and Irish Rover ensures that students have access to a broad spectrum of perspectives, fostering an environment that values free thought and open dialogue. As the student body continues to grow and evolve, it is likely that new media outlets will emerge to reflect the changing interests and needs of the student population. Additionally, the use of digital platforms and social media may lead to the creation of new forms of student-generated content, further enriching the Notre Dame media landscape.', 7)
