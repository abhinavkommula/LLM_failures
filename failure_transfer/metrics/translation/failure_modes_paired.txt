Idiomatic Expressions: Phrases that don't translate directly between languages, such as "raise the bar," can lead to literal translations that miss the intended meaning, as seen in the translation "raise the standard."
Ambiguity and Polysemy: Words or phrases that have multiple meanings or interpretations can cause translation errors. For example, "executionist movement" in the original sentence could refer to a political movement or a judicial practice, leading to a vague translation like "executive action" or "enforcement of the laws."
Neologisms and Unconventional Usage: Newly coined terms or unconventional uses of words, such as "leap-frog migration" or "hyphenated Americans," can confuse translation models, resulting in translations that are either overly literal or nonsensical.
Cultural References: Terms or concepts specific to a particular culture, such as "Skid Row" or "Fish Mouth," may not have direct equivalents in other languages, leading to translations that are either too literal or completely off the mark.
Ellipsis and Implicit Information: Sentences that omit elements understood in context can be challenging for translation models. For example, "The British dealt with range measurement first" relies on implicit knowledge that "range measurement" refers to a specific historical context, which may not be captured in the translation.
