Idiomatic Expressions: [Animal-related idioms: Many of the failures involve idioms related to animals (e.g., "let the cat out of the bag," "barking up the wrong tree," "a different kettle of fish"). These expressions often have no direct equivalent in other languages, leading to translations that either take the animal reference literally or miss the idiomatic meaning entirely; Body part idioms: Idioms that involve body parts (e.g., "bite the bullet," "keep an eye on," "pull someone's leg") are also commonly mistranslated. The figurative use of body parts in these expressions is often lost in translation. ]
Ambiguous Words with Multiple Meanings: [Homonyms: Words that sound the same but have different meanings (e.g., "bass" as in the fish or the musical instrument, "bark" as in the sound a dog makes or the outer covering of a tree) are frequently mistranslated because the context needed to disambiguate them is not always correctly interpreted by the translation model; Words with both literal and figurative meanings: Words like "strike" (which can mean to hit or a work stoppage) or "pitch" (which can refer to a tone or a sports field) are often translated based on their literal meaning, ignoring the figurative or context-specific usage. ]
Cultural References: [Holidays and traditions: References to specific holidays (e.g., "Thanksgiving," "Mardi Gras") or traditions (e.g., "Running of the Bulls") are often translated in a way that loses the cultural specificity, replacing them with more generic terms or misunderstanding the context; Famous personalities or characters: Names of well-known figures (e.g., "Buster Keaton," "Uncle Sam") are sometimes translated literally or replaced with unrelated terms, losing the cultural reference. ]
Complex Syntax or Structure: [Nested clauses or phrases: Sentences with multiple layers of clauses or phrases (e.g., "The seasoned politician knew when to hold his cards close to his chest, especially when the chips were down") are often simplified in translation, losing the complexity and nuance of the original; Conditional or hypothetical statements: Sentences that express conditions or hypothetical scenarios (e.g., "If he didn't bite the bullet and confront his fears") are frequently mistranslated, with the conditionality or hypothetical nature of the statement being lost or misrepresented ]
Figurative Language: [Metaphors: Metaphorical expressions (e.g., "burning the midnight oil," "skating on thin ice") are often translated too literally, losing the figurative meaning and imagery; Similes: Similes (e.g., "like a flash in the pan," "as high as a kite") are also commonly mistranslated, with the comparison being lost or misunderstood in the translation ]
Colloquialisms or Slang: [Sports-related slang: Many of the failures involve slang terms related to sports (e.g., "hit it out of the park" for a significant success, "on the ball" for being alert). These expressions often lose their metaphorical meaning in translation and are taken literally or replaced with unrelated terms; Casual expressions for actions: Slang terms that describe actions in a casual or informal way (e.g., "spill the beans" for revealing a secret, "kick the bucket" for dying) are frequently mistranslated, with the figurative meaning being lost. ]
Connotations and Subtext: [Negative connotations: Words or phrases with negative connotations (e.g., "a thorn in one's side" for a persistent annoyance, "bite the bullet" for enduring something unpleasant) are often translated without preserving the negative aspect, leading to a loss of the intended emotional impact; Subtext of urgency or importance: Expressions that convey a sense of urgency or importance (e.g., "the eleventh hour" for the last moment, "a red flag" for a warning sign) may be translated too literally, missing the underlying sense of urgency or warning. ]
Allusions and References [Mythological or historical references: Allusions to mythology or history (e.g., "a Herculean task" for a very difficult task, "open Pandora's box" for causing unforeseen problems) are often translated without maintaining the reference, resulting in a loss of the rich cultural or historical context; Literary references: References to famous works of literature or literary characters (e.g., "a Catch-22 situation" from Joseph Heller's novel, "a Scrooge" for a miserly person from Dickens' "A Christmas Carol") may be translated in a way that strips away the literary connection, reducing the depth of the expression. ]
