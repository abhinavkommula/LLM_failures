I am trying to find failures with a language model's ability to translate. I have provided sentences that it consistently scores poorly on, along with sentences that it consistently scores strongly on. Using these specific examples, are there any general types of failures you notice the language model is making, or any common features that the language model is unable to translate well? Focus on failures or common features that are present amongst the weak translations, but not present amongst the strong translations. Try to give failures that are specific enough that someone could reliably produce examples that the language model would translate poorly. Please summarize as many as you can and stick to the examples. Remember, the general features you provide should be present in the weak examples but not present in the strong examples.
