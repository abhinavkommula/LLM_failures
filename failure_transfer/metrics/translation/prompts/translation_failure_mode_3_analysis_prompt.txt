I will provide a series of data for you to remember. Subsequently, I will ask you some questions to test your performance! Here are some prompts for you to memorize.

I am looking for failures with a language model. Below are pairs of sentences, the original sentence along with the back-translation performed by the languge model (the result of translating the original from english to Spanish, and then from Spanish back to english). The back-translated exmaples are not strong translations, as it differs significantly in meaning and structure from the original sentence. Using these specific examples, are there any common failures you notice amongst the back-translated sentences and the original sentences? Try to give differences in the back-translated sentences that are specific, along with a clear description of the differences you notice with examples. Focus on the most common features across back-translated sentences.
