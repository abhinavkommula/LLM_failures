Back-translated:   They agreed to meet at the usual spot after dusk, knowing the risks involved and the eyes that would be watching.In English, the verb "agreed" is not available, so I used the verb "acordarse" which means "to remember or agree". The verb "meet" in Spanish is "reunirse". "Lugar" in Spanish can also mean "place", so I used "usual spot" instead of "usual place". "Crepúsculo" specifically refers to the time just before sunset, so I kept the original phrase. "Risks involved" is a literal translation of "riesgos involucrados", but in Spanish, "riesgos" is a more general term that can refer to any kind of danger or risk.

The disestablishment of the British Isles refers to the process of colonization and integration of the islands into the English language and culture, which began in the 16th century and continued until the 19th century. This process led to the decline and eventual loss of the Celtic languages spoken on the islands, including Old Irish, Old Welsh, and Old Cornish.The linguist argues that the disestablishment of the British Isles had significant syntactic consequences for the Celtic insular dialects, including the loss of grammatical structures and the simplification of sentence structure.

Diversified ecosystem: Polyculture creates a more diverse and resilient ecosystem, as different crops provide different ecological services, such as pest control, nutrient cycling, and soil health.2. Reduced pests and diseases: By growing multiple crops together, polyculture can reduce the risk of pests and diseases, as different crops may have different pest and disease resistance.3. Improved soil health: Polyculture can improve soil health by increasing the diversity of microorganisms and improving soil structure, as different crops have different root structures and nutrient requirements.4. Enhanced biodiversity: Polyculture can increase biodiversity by providing habitat for a variety of insects, birds, and other wildlife, which can help to maintain ecosystem services and resilience.5. Increased yields: Polyculture can lead to increased yields, as different crops may have complementary growth habits and can benefit from each other's shade, nutrients, or other resources.6. Reduced chemical use: Polyculture can reduce the need for chemical inputs, such as pesticides and fertilizers, as the diversity of crops can help to maintain ecosystem balance and reduce the risk of pests and diseases.7.

Improved soil fertility: Polyculture can improve soil fertility, as different crops can contribute to soil fertility in different ways, such as through the addition of organic matter or the fixation of nutrients.In conclusion, polyculture offers many advantages over monoculture, particularly in the context of permaculture design principles, which prioritize the creation of diverse and resilient ecosystems. By incorporating polyculture into agricultural systems, farmers can improve soil health, reduce the need for chemical inputs, increase yields, and enhance ecosystem services, leading to more sustainable and productive agriculture.),

I am looking for failures with a language model. Below are pairs of sentences, the original sentence along with the back-translation performed by the languge model (the result of translating the original from english to Spanish, and then from Spanish back to english). The back-translated exmaples are not strong translations, as it differs significantly in meaning and structure from the original sentence. Using these specific examples, are there any common failures you notice amongst the back-translated sentences and the original sentences? Try to give differences in the back-translated sentences that are specific, along with a clear description of the differences you notice with examples. Focus on the most common features across back-translated sentences.
