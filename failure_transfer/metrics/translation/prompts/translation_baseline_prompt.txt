I will provide a series of data for you to remember. Subsequently, I will ask you some questions to test your performance! Here are some prompts for you to memorize.

I am looking for failures with a language model. Below are pairs of sentences that are written differently, even though they convey similar concepts. The first sentence in each pair is a sentence that a language model translates poorly, while the second sentence is an example it translates well. Using these specific examples, are there any common differences you notice between weak and strong pairs? Focus on differences you observe between the weak and strong sentences that would hinder a language model's ability to translate text accurately. Try to give features that are specific enough that someone could reliably produce examples that the language model would translate poorly. In your failure modes, explain clearly why the difference between weak and strong sentence would lead to problems for future tasks related to translation. Focus on the most common differences across weak and strong sentences.
