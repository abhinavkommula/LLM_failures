Ambiguity and Polysemy: Words or phrases that have multiple meanings or interpretations can cause translation errors. For example, "executionist movement" in the original sentence could refer to a political movement or a judicial practice, leading to a vague translation like "executive action" or "enforcement of the laws."
Idiomatic Expressions: Phrases that don't translate directly between languages, such as "raise the bar," can lead to literal translations that miss the intended meaning, as seen in the translation "raise the standard."
Cultural References: Terms or concepts specific to a particular culture, such as "Skid Row" or "Fish Mouth," may not have direct equivalents in other languages, leading to translations that are either too literal or completely off the mark.
Complex Syntax: Sentences with intricate structures or multiple clauses can be challenging to translate accurately. For example, the sentence "Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and 'voice tricks' akin to ventriloquism" contains several descriptive phrases that can easily be misinterpreted or rearranged incorrectly in translation.
Specialized Terminology: Words specific to a field or discipline, such as "myenteric reflexes" or "CMBS loan underwriting," may not be well-represented in translation models, leading to translations that are either overly general or incorrect.
Neologisms and Unconventional Usage: Newly coined terms or unconventional uses of words, such as "leap-frog migration" or "hyphenated Americans," can confuse translation models, resulting in translations that are either overly literal or nonsensical.
Pronoun Reference Ambiguity: Ambiguity in pronoun references can lead to incorrect translations. For example, in the sentence "He later served as Chairman for the California Governor's Council," the pronoun "He" might be translated without a clear antecedent, leading to confusion in the back-translation.
Ellipsis and Implicit Information: Sentences that omit elements understood in context can be challenging for translation models. For example, "The British dealt with range measurement first" relies on implicit knowledge that "range measurement" refers to a specific historical context, which may not be captured in the translation.
Metaphorical Language: Metaphors and figurative language can be difficult to translate accurately. For example, "The Confederacy was being strangled" uses a metaphor to describe a situation, which might be translated too literally, losing the intended imagery.
Conjunction Ambiguity: Ambiguity in the use of conjunctions can lead to incorrect translations. For example, in "he reveled in mimicry and 'voice tricks' akin to ventriloquism," the conjunction "and" could be interpreted in multiple ways, potentially leading to a translation that misconstrues the relationship between the two activities.
