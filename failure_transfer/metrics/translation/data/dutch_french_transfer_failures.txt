The term "Muller\'s ratchet" was coined by the geneticist Hermann J. Muller, who first described the phenomenon in the 1930s.The phrase "association avec des taille de population plus faible" means "in association with smaller population sizes." This refers to the idea that the smaller the population size, the more susceptible it is to the deleterious effects of mutations.The term "accumulation de mutations nuisibles" means "accumulation of deleterious mutations." This refers to the idea that as the population size decreases, the number of deleterious mutations in the genetic material of the population also increases.Finally, the term "gènes non essentiels" means "non-essential genes."
