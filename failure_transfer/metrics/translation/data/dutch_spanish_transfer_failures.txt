Illumination is a philosophical concept that refers to a profound and complete understanding of reality, which allows a person to comprehend life and the world in a more profound and perspicuous manner. It is a personal transformation process that involves the liberation of ignorance and illusion, and the understanding of truth and reality as they are. In Western philosophy, illumination is often associated with the idea that the individual can attain a full comprehension of reality through reflection and meditation. This comprehension is considered a form of liberation from suffering and ignorance, and is often associated with the idea of spiritual illumination. In Eastern philosophy, illumination is also a central concept, and is often associated with the idea of Buddhist illumination. In this context, illumination is seen as a personal transformation process that involves the elimination of ignorance and the attachments that prevent a person from understanding reality in a profound manner. In summary, illumination refers to a state of profound and complete understanding of reality, which involves the liberation of ignorance and illusion, and the comprehension of truth and reality as they are.', 0.6262578964233398, 0)

In protostomes, on the other hand, the cleavage process occurs spirally, meaning that the cells divide and differentiate in a spiral pattern, resulting in the formation of a solid ball of cells.So, in summary, the text is stating that deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage.', 0.8867541551589966, 1)
