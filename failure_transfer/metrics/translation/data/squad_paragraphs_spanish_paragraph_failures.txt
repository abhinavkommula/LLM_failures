('George Gipp was the school\'s legendary football player during 1916–20. He played semiprofessional baseball and smoked, drank, and gambled when not playing sports. He was also humble, generous to the needy, and a man of integrity. It was in 1928 that famed coach Knute Rockne used his final conversation with the dying Gipp to inspire the Notre Dame team to beat the Army team and "win one for the Gipper." The 1940 film, Knute Rockne, All American, starred Pat O\'Brien as Knute Rockne and Ronald Reagan as Gipp. Today the team competes in Notre Dame Stadium, an 80,795-seat stadium on campus. The current head coach is Brian Kelly, hired from the University of Cincinnati on December 11, 2009. Kelly\'s record in midway through his sixth season at Notre Dame is 52–21. In 2012, Kelly\'s Fighting Irish squad went undefeated and played in the BCS National Championship Game. Kelly succeeded Charlie Weis, who was fired in November 2009 after five seasons. Although Weis led his team to two Bowl Championship Series bowl games, his overall record was 35–27, mediocre by Notre Dame standards, and the 2007 team had the most losses in school history. The football team generates enough revenue to operate independently while $22.1 million is retained from the team\'s profits for academic use. Forbes named the team as the most valuable in college football, worth a total of $101 million in 2007.', " The original text contains some inaccuracies, such as the year of George Gipp's death, which was actually in 1920,", 0.37533894, 0)

He stated:"The Three Gorges Dam project, which was officially completed in 2006, is a symbol of China\'s engineering capabilities. However, its construction was not without controversy. The dam was built on the Yangtze River, the longest river in Asia, and its construction caused significant environmental damage. The displacement of over a million people was another major issue.The dam\'s reservoir covers an area of over 1,000 square miles, and its construction required the relocation of over 1.3 million people. The environmental impact assessment for the project was criticized for being inadequate, and there were concerns about the potential for landslides and earthquakes.Despite these concerns, the Chinese government pushed forward with the project, citing its economic benefits and the need to address China\'s energy needs. The dam is now the world\'s largest power station in terms of installed capacity, and it provides electricity to millions of people in China.However, the environmental costs have been significant. The dam has caused the extinction of several species, including the Chinese paddlefish and the Yangtze sturgeon. The reservoir has also led to an increase in water temperature, which has affected the river\'s ecosystem.Furthermore, the dam has been criticized for its safety. In 2003, a landslide caused by the dam\'s construction killed over 500 people. There have also been concerns about the potential for a major earthquake to cause significant damage to the dam.In conclusion, while the Three Gorges Dam is a remarkable engineering feat, it has come at a significant cost to the environment and to the people displaced by its construction. The Chinese government\'s push to complete the project despite these concerns raises questions about its priorities and its commitment to sustainability."', 0.678177, 0)

('Allusions to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, has drawn the attention from legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that "a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals". The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: "Lawyers, I suppose, were children once." Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem\'s childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one\'s palm and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him. Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra\'s "fanatical" attempts to place her in them made her feel "a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]". Johnson states, "[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds."', 'References to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, have attracted the attention of legal scholars.

('Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago. Many ancient cultures, including the ancient Egyptians and ancient Greeks, used specially selected mold and plant materials and extracts to treat infections. More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. Louis Pasteur observed, "if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics". The term \'antibiosis\', meaning "against life", was introduced by the French bacteriologist Jean Paul Vuillemin as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs. Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis. These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by Selman Waksman, an American microbiologist, in 1942. Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s. Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not.

After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; "instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure."

The female characters who comment the most on Scout\'s lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus\' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, "Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child."', " As Lee explores Jem's growth in acknowledging a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what it signifies to be a woman, and various female characters shape her development. Scout's main identification with her father and older brother enables her to depict the complexity and depth of the female characters in the novel from both within their ranks and as an outsider. Scout's primary female role models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective.

('Antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes. Those that target the bacterial cell wall (penicillins and cephalosporins) or the cell membrane (polymyxins), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (rifamycins, lipiarmycins, quinolones, and sulfonamides) have bactericidal activities. Those that target protein synthesis (macrolides, lincosamides and tetracyclines) are usually bacteriostatic (with the exception of bactericidal aminoglycosides). Further categorization is based on their target specificity. "Narrow-spectrum" antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late 2000s and early 2010s: cyclic lipopeptides (such as daptomycin), glycylcyclines (such as tigecycline), oxazolidinones (such as linezolid), and lipiarmycins (such as fidaxomicin).', 'Antibiotic antibacterial agents are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity.

('Phage therapy is another option that is being looked into for treating resistant strains of bacteria. The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles. By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell\'s death. Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse. One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect "good" bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings.

("Florey and Chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, penicillin G, in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. Later, Norman Heatley developed the back extraction technique for efficiently purifying penicillin in bulk. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides.

Later, Norman Heatley developed an efficient mass production technique for penicillin purification through rear extraction. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945. Purified penicillin showed powerful antibacterial activity against a broad range of bacteria and low toxicity for humans. Moreover, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents like pus, unlike synthetic sulfonamides.

Political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies, a new development started from the 1960s, and is still unfolding: anthropologists started increasingly to study more "complex" social settings in which the presence of states, bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena. The turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels. First of all, anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state-regulated sphere (as in patron-client relations or tribal political organization). Second of all, anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions (and of course on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions). An anthropology of the state developed, and it is a most thriving field today.

('The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon. Emergence of resistance often reflects evolutionary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug. For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria–Delbrück experiment. Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.', 'The emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a common occurrence.

Historian James M. McPherson (2001) reported that at least 120 people were killed. Eleven black men were lynched during the five-day riots, causing hundreds of blacks to flee the city to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and New Jersey. The black population in Manhattan dropped below 10,000 by 1865, a figure it had last reached in 1820. The white working class had gained control. Longshoremen's violence against black men was particularly intense in the dock area. The riots were one of the most significant incidents of civil unrest in American history.", 0.9888682, 1)

Tom Robinson\'s trial was influenced by poor white farmers, who convicted him despite clear evidence of his innocence, with more educated and moderate white townspeople supporting the jury\'s decision. Additionally, the character in To Kill a Mockingbird who suffered racial injustice was physically disabled, making him unable to commit the act he was accused of but also limiting him in other ways. Roslyn Siegel uses Tom Robinson as an illustration of the common theme among white Southern writers depicting the black man as "stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and reliant on the mercy of whites instead of his own intelligence." Despite being spared from lynching, Tom is killed brutally during an escape attempt from prison, shot seventeen times.', 0.9900198, 1)

Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as executive producers, and the non-Eon film Never Say Never Again, an updated remake of Thunderball, in 1983. A second remake, titled Warhead 2000 A.D., was planned for production and release in the 1990s but was ultimately abandoned. According to the terms of the 1963 settlement, the literary rights remained with Fleming, enabling the Spectre organization and associated characters to continue appearing in print.', 0.9909173, 1)

"The energy of the sun is free, clean, and inexhaustible." "It is a shame that we have to wait until the oil and coal are exhausted before we turn to the sun for power." "The sun is the greatest source of energy, and the desert is the greatest source of solar energy." "We can use the sun\'s rays to produce electricity in quantities as great as those produced by coal or oil." "The desert countries can thus industrialize themselves and become independent of the oil companies." "The sun is the greatest source of energy for peace." "Let us work together to make solar energy a reality." "It is not a dream, but a practical project which can be accomplished in our lifetime." "Let us harness the power of the sun and create a new world of abundance and prosperity for all." "The sun is the greatest source of energy for peace and prosperity." "Let us make it our goal to make solar energy a reality, not just for our own benefit, but for the benefit of all mankind." "The sun is the greatest source of energy for a sustainable future."

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations.

('In 1565, the powerful Rinbung princes were overthrown by one of their own ministers, Karma Tseten who styled himself as the Tsangpa, "the one of Tsang", and established his base of power at Shigatse. The second successor of this first Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, took control of the whole of Central Tibet (Ü-Tsang), reigning from 1611–1621. Despite this, the leaders of Lhasa still claimed their allegiance to the Phagmodru as well as the Gelug, while the Ü-Tsang king allied with the Karmapa. Tensions rose between the nationalistic Ü-Tsang ruler and the Mongols who safeguarded their Mongol Dalai Lama in Lhasa. The fourth Dalai Lama refused to give an audience to the Ü-Tsang king, which sparked a conflict as the latter began assaulting Gelug monasteries. Chen writes of the speculation over the fourth Dalai Lama\'s mysterious death and the plot of the Ü-Tsang king to have him murdered for "cursing" him with illness, although Chen writes that the murder was most likely the result of a feudal power struggle. In 1618, only two years after Yonten Gyatso died, the Gelug and the Karma Kargyu went to war, the Karma Kargyu supported by the secular Ü-Tsang king. The Ü-Tsang ruler had a large number of Gelugpa lamas killed, occupied their monasteries at Drepung and Sera, and outlawed any attempts to find another Dalai Lama. In 1621, the Ü-Tsang king died and was succeeded by his young son Karma Tenkyong, an event which stymied the war effort as the latter accepted the six-year-old Lozang Gyatso as the new Dalai Lama. Despite the new Dalai Lama\'s diplomatic efforts to maintain friendly relations with the new Ü-Tsang ruler, Sonam Rapten (1595–1657), the Dalai Lama\'s chief steward and treasurer at Drepung, made efforts to overthrow the Ü-Tsang king, which led to another conflict. In 1633, the Gelugpas and several thousand Mongol adherents defeated the Ü-Tsang king\'s troops near Lhasa before a peaceful negotiation was settled.

Madison County was the first to take advantage of the newly authorized taxes and formed the first public school in Virginia City in 1866. The first school year was scheduled to begin in January 1866, but severe weather delayed its opening until March. The first school year lasted all summer and ended on August 17. One of the first school teachers was Sarah Raymond. She was a 25-year-old woman who traveled to Virginia City in a wagon train in 1865. To become a certified teacher, Raymond took an exam at home and paid a $6 gold dust fee for a teaching certificate. With the help of an assistant teacher, Mrs. Farley, Raymond was responsible for teaching 50 to 60 students a day out of the 81 students enrolled in the school. Sarah Raymond stopped teaching the following year, but later became the superintendent of schools in Madison County.", 0.99538654, 1)

('Scholars have characterized To Kill a Mockingbird as both a Southern Gothic and coming-of-age or Bildungsroman novel. The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson contribute to the aura of the Gothic in the novel. Lee used the term "Gothic" to describe the architecture of Maycomb\'s courthouse and in regard to Dill\'s exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley. Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem\'s questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Despite challenging the town\'s systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one\'s conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism.

('The Mongol prince Godan, a grandson of Genghis Khan, raided as far as Lhasa. During his attack in 1240, Prince Godan summoned Sakya Pandita (1182–1251), leader of the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, to his court in what is now Gansu in Western China. With Sakya Pandita\'s submission to Godan in 1247, Tibet was officially incorporated into the Mongol Empire during the regency of Töregene Khatun (1241–1246). Michael C. van Walt van Praag writes that Godan granted Sakya Pandita temporal authority over a still politically fragmented Tibet, stating that "this investiture had little real impact" but it was significant in that it established the unique "Priest-Patron" relationship between the Mongols and the Sakya lamas.', ' The Mongol prince Godan, a grandson of Genghis Khan, raided as far as Lhasa.

("Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1). However, with the exception of his Funeral March, the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others. There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time. The Funeral March, the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op. 35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.", " Some of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the Revolutionary Étude (Op. 10, No. 12), and the Minute Waltz (Op. 64, No. 1).
