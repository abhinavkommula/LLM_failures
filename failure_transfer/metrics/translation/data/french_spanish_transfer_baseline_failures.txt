('Compare: historical demography of Poland.', "Historical demography of PolandPoland has a rich and complex demographic history that spans over a thousand years. From the early Middle Ages to the present day, the country has experienced significant population fluctuations, migrations, and social changes.In the early Middle Ages, Poland was inhabited by various Slavic tribes, including the Polans, Mazovians, and Pomeranians. The country's population grew steadily during this period, with estimates suggesting that it reached around 1 million people by the 10th century.The 13th century saw the arrival of the Teutonic Knights, a German military order that conquered much of Poland and brought significant demographic changes. The Knights introduced feudalism and Germanic customs, which had a lasting impact on the country's social and economic structures.The 14th to 17th centuries were marked by a series of devastating wars, including the Swedish Deluge and the Great Northern War, which resulted in significant population decline. The population of Poland did not recover fully until the 19th century.The 19th and early 20th centuries saw rapid population growth, driven by improvements in agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization. However, the country's population was severely affected by World War I and World War II, with estimates suggesting that around 20% of the population died during these conflicts.After World War II, Poland became a Soviet satellite state, and its population experienced significant changes due to mass migrations, urbanization, and population policies. The country's population grew rapidly during this period, with estimates suggesting that it reached around 20 million people by the late 1980s.Since the fall of communism in 1989, Poland has experienced further demographic changes, including a decline in fertility rates and an aging population. Today, Poland has a population of around 38 million people, with a median age of around 40 years.Overall, the historical demography of Poland is characterized by significant population fluctuations, migrations, and social changes, shaped by a complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors.", 0.44604676961898804, 0)
