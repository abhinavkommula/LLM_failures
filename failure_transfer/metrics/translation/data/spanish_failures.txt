This understanding is based on reason, the divine gift of humanity, and experience, the source of truth. Enlightenment is not only a transformation in knowledge but also a transformation in human life in general.Enlightenment is based on the idea that truth is a universal law that can be discovered through reasoning and experience. This idea opposes the belief that truth is a divine revelation received through faith. Enlightenment also opposes superstition, the belief in the truth of things without evidence or foundation.Enlightenment has led humanity to surpass the barrier of credulity, which is blind belief in things without evidence.

For example, "perro" is pronounced "pe-ro".* The tone can change depending on the context and region. In some dialects, the tone can fall on the penultimate syllable, as in "perro" (dog) in some Andalusian dialects.* The intonation also varies depending on the context and region.

This groundbreaking work, edited by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d\'Alembert, was the result of a long and complex process that involved the collaboration of many scholars and intellectuals. Over the next twenty-five years, the Encyclopedia grew to become one of the most comprehensive and authoritative reference works of its time, covering a wide range of topics including science, philosophy, literature, and the arts.The success of the Encyclopedia was due in large part to the innovative approach of its editors, who sought to present information in a clear and accessible manner, free from the obscurantism and dogmatism that had characterized earlier reference works. The Encyclopedia was also notable for its commitment to intellectual freedom and its rejection of censorship, as it sought to provide a platform for the expression of diverse viewpoints and ideas.Despite its many achievements, the Encyclopedia was not without its challenges and controversies. It faced opposition from religious and political authorities, who saw it as a threat to their power and authority. In response, the editors of the Encyclopedia were forced to engage in a series of debates and confrontations with their detractors, defending the principles of intellectual freedom and the importance of open inquiry.Despite these challenges, the Encyclopedia continued to grow and evolve, with new editions and supplements being published throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

('He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole."', '  He spoke of the paradox of deflation, in which measures that may be intelligent for individuals and businesses—and which are actually essential to return the economy to a normal state—yes, magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.In this paradox, measures that may seem smart for individuals and businesses, such as cutting costs and reducing prices, can actually exacerbate the economic distress. These measures may lead to a vicious cycle of decreased demand, which can further reduce prices and lead to a deeper economic downturn.For example, if a company reduces its prices to increase sales, it may lead to a decrease in demand for its products, which can result in lower sales and profits. Similarly, if individuals reduce their spending to save money, it can lead to a decrease in demand for goods and services, which can result in lower economic growth and job losses.Therefore, while individual and business measures may seem intelligent in the short term, they can actually magnify the economic distress in the long term. It is essential to adopt a comprehensive approach to address the economic challenges, including monetary and fiscal policies, as well as structural reforms to improve the competitiveness of the economy.', 0.8836666, -1)

"Protostomes," on the other hand, refers to a group of animals that have a single-layered gut.In the context of embryonic development, the term "cleavage" refers to the process of cell division that occurs early in embryonic development, resulting in the formation of a cluster of cells called a blastula. During this process, the cells of the embryo divide and differentiate into different layers, resulting in the formation of the embryo\'s body plan.In deuterostomes, the cleavage process occurs radially, meaning that the cells divide and differentiate in a radial (or spiral) pattern, resulting in the formation of a hollow ball of cells. In protostomes, on the other hand, the cleavage process occurs spirally, meaning that the cells divide and differentiate in a spiral pattern, resulting in the formation of a solid ball of cells.So, in summary, the text is stating that deuterostomes undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage.', 0.8867541, -1)
