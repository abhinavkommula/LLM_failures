The treaty consists of 15 articles that cover various aspects of the relations between Ethiopia and Italy, including border conflicts, trade, economic support, and diplomatic relations. The treaty was signed by the emperor of Ethiopia, Menelik II, and the Italian minister of foreign affairs, Count di Robilant.

It is the source of all life and the foundation of all knowledge. It is the only truth that exists beyond time and space and beyond the laws of nature.The Upanishads also describe the structure of the world as a harmonious order in which all things and beings have their own role and function.

By examining these data, one can gain insights into the demographic developments of Poland since the Middle Ages.In the Middle Ages, Poland's population was relatively small, with an estimated population of around 1 million people in the 14th century. During the Reformation in the 16th century, the population declined due to the depopulation of the country as a result of wars and plague epidemics. After the partition of Poland in the 18th century, the population grew slowly but steadily, primarily due to immigration from other parts of Europe.In the 19th century, the population of Poland grew rapidly, primarily due to a high birth rate and a low death rate. This was largely due to the fact that Poland was a young country with an average age of around 25 years.In the 20th century, the population of Poland grew again, primarily due to a high birth rate and a low death rate. The population of Poland grew from around 35 million in 1900 to around 39 million in 2000.In the 21st century, the population of Poland is still growing, primarily due to a high birth rate and a low death rate. The population of Poland is now around 40 million.In conclusion, the historical demography of Poland shows that the population of Poland has grown since the Middle Ages and that this process is still ongoing.
