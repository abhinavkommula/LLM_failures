According to their research, the magnetic field has decreased by 10% in the past decade, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. This decline in the magnetic field has significant implications for navigation and communication systems that rely on the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and direction. The researchers suggest that the weakening of the magnetic field may be caused by changes in the Earth's core, such as the movement of molten iron or changes in the Earth's rotation. Further research is needed to fully understand the causes and consequences of this phenomenon.", 0.47789931297302246, 0)
