They reject the idea that literature can be reduced to a set of objective, universal truths, and instead emphasize the importance of context, history, and the reader\'s personal experience in shaping the meaning of a text.Warren\'s work, in particular, has been influential in the development of the New Criticism movement, which emphasizes the close reading of literary texts and the importance of the reader\'s subjective experience. His book, "The Literary Criticism of the New England Transcendentalists," is a seminal work in the field, and his essay "The Boundaries of the Self" is a classic of literary theory.Brown, on the other hand, has been influential in the development of the "reader-response" approach to literary criticism, which emphasizes the reader\'s subjective experience and the role of the reader in shaping the meaning of a text. His work has been particularly influential in the field of American literature, and his book "The Reader\'s Response" is a foundational text in the field of literary studies.Overall, the work of Warren and Brown has had a profound impact on the field of literary criticism, and their ideas continue to shape the way we think about literature and the reader\'s experience today.', 0.41676718, -1)

('From Immanuel Kant\'s 1784 essay "Beantwortung der Frage: Was ist Aufklärung?"', '"What is Enlightenment?"In this essay, I will attempt to answer the question of what enlightenment is. Enlightenment is a term that has been used in various contexts throughout history, but its meaning has evolved over time. In the 18th century, the term was used to describe a philosophical movement that sought to challenge traditional beliefs and promote reason, science, and individual liberty.According to Kant, enlightenment is not just a state of being informed or educated, but rather a process of critical thinking and self-reflection. It is the ability to think for oneself, to question one\'s own beliefs and values, and to challenge those of others. Enlightenment is not a destination, but a journey, a continuous process of self-discovery and growth.Kant argues that enlightenment is not limited to the realm of knowledge, but also extends to ethics and morality. He believes that enlightenment requires a commitment to moral principles and a willingness to act in accordance with those principles. In other words, enlightenment is not just about understanding the world, but also about acting in a way that is morally right.In conclusion, enlightenment is a complex and multifaceted concept that involves both intellectual and moral dimensions. It is a process of critical thinking and self-reflection that requires a commitment to reason, science, and individual liberty. By embracing enlightenment, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them, and can live a more fulfilling and meaningful life."I hope this helps!

Additionally, some people may not identify as bisexual due to social stigma or other factors.Overall, the exact percentage of the population that is bisexual is difficult to determine due to the complexity of defining and measuring bisexuality.
