The man looked at them and laughed. He told them, "Of course, boys. I will tell you. I don\'t fish for fish. I buy them from the store and sell them here. It is easier and faster. Do you want to buy some?" Tim and Sam were shocked and angry. They felt cheated and deceived. They replied, "No, thank you. We don\'t want your fish. You are not intelligent and rich. You are a cheat and a fraud. We will fish our own fish with our rod." They returned to their rod and their tub. They hoped to catch a big fish and show it to the man. They learned a lesson that day. They learned that not everyone is honest and that fishing is hard work. But they also learned that fishing is fun and rewarding.
