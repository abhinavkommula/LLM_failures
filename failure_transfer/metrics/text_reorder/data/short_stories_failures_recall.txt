He gave him a new pencil and a new canvas.He saw a small, faint signature at the bottom of the canvas. He told him he was an artist. Tommy was surprised. He smiled.It was white and smooth and perfect for his pencil. He told him he was not mad. You ruined it with your filthy pencil! He told him he was proud of him.
