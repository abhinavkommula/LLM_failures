('Ergodic homeomorphisms @xmath0 and @xmath1 of Polish probability spaces @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be classified as "evenly Kakutani equivalent" if there exists an orbit equivalence @xmath4 between full measure subsets of @xmath2 and @xmath3.

('In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of low energy elastic exciton-exciton scattering using the effective mass approximation. Unlike previous approaches, we adopt a non-perturbative treatment of the four-particle scattering problem, providing a complete understanding of the system.

Conversely, the magnetic field (@xmath1) exhibits a decrease with increasing source activity, while the break energy of the electron spectrum (@xmath2) and the Doppler factor (@xmath3) experience an increase.

('In this study, we investigated the absorption behavior of free linear chains in a polymer brush, focusing on chain size and compatibility with the brush. Monte Carlo simulations and density functional theory/self-consistent field theory were employed to analyze the absorption process at moderate and high grafting densities. Our results revealed a distinct transition from weak to strong absorption for longer chains, while oligomers exhibited weaker absorption. Additionally, we observed that longer species predominantly occupied the inner part of a moderately dense brush, whereas in a dense brush, they penetrated only into the "fluffy" tail. The gyration radius and end-to-end distance of absorbed chains scaled with their length, resembling free polymers in the bulk. Furthermore, we identified a critical value of compatibility, where the energy of free chains reached the same value regardless of length, while the entropy displayed a pronounced minimum. The kinetics of penetration/expulsion of free chains into the brush exhibited three distinct regimes based on chain length, with the time of absorption increasing at different rates. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the absorption dynamics of linear chains in a polymer brush.', '  In a study, researchers investigated the absorption behavior of free linear chains in a polymer brush, focusing on chain size and compatibility with the brush.

To achieve this, we have compiled high signal-to-noise (S/N) median composites using SDSS spectra from both the Hu et al. sample and our own sample of the 469 brightest DR5 spectra. These composites are generated in bins of full width at half maximum (FWHM) Hα and FeII strength, as defined in our 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) formalism. Our analysis reveals no evidence supporting a systematic FeII redshift, instead demonstrating consistency with previous assumptions that FeII shift and FWHM follow Hα shift and FWHM in nearly all sources. This finding supports the hypothesis that FeII emission, which is quasi-ubiquitous in Type 1 sources, originates from a broad-line region with the same geometry and kinematics as the region producing the Balmer lines.', '  In this study, the authors investigate the claim made by Hu et al.

('In this study, we conducted an analysis of star formation in the nuclei of 9 Seyfert galaxies, focusing on spatial resolutions as low as 0.085, which corresponds to length scales of approximately 10pc in most objects. Our data was primarily obtained using the near infrared adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles exhibited size scales typically ranging from a few tens of parsecs. Notably, two cases presented clear kinematic evidence of stellar disks at these scales. Our findings suggest the occurrence of recent, but no longer active, starbursts within the past 10-300 million years in the nuclear regions. The stellar luminosity in the central 10pc was found to be only a few percent of the AGN, while on kiloparsec scales, the luminosities were comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density displayed a consistent trend across all objects, steadily increasing at smaller radii up to approximately 1kpc in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density exceeded 10^3 M/pc^2. The intense starbursts observed were likely Eddington-limited and therefore short-lived, suggesting that they occur in multiple short bursts. Our data also suggests a delay of 50-100 million years between the onset of star formation and subsequent fuelling of the black hole, potentially influenced by the role of stellar ejecta in the fuelling process. While ob winds and supernovae contribute to significant mass ejection, their high velocities limit their accretion. Conversely, winds from AGB stars dominate the total mass loss and can be efficiently accreted due to their slower speeds.', '  In this study, the authors analyzed the star formation in the nuclei of 9 Seyfert galaxies using high-resolution spectroscopy.
