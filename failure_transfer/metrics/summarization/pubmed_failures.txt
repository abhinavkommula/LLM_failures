(' background : celiac disease ( cd ) is a common autoimmune disorder .  efficient identification of patients may improve chronic management of the disease .  prior studies have shown searching international classification of diseases-9 ( icd-9 ) codes alone is inaccurate for identifying patients with cd . in this study , we developed automated classification algorithms leveraging pathology reports and other clinical data in electronic health records ( ehrs ) to refine the subset population preselected using icd-9 code ( 579.0).materials and methods : ehrs were searched for established icd-9 code ( 579.0 ) suggesting cd , based on which an initial identification of cases was obtained .  in addition , laboratory results for tissue transglutaminse were extracted .  using natural language processing we analyzed pathology reports from upper endoscopy .  twelve machine learning classifiers using different combinations of variables related to icd-9 cd status , laboratory result status , and pathology reports were experimented to find the best possible cd classifier .  ten - fold cross - validation was used to assess the results.results:a total of 1498 patient records were used including 363 confirmed cases and 1135 false positive cases that served as controls . logistic model based on both clinical and pathology report  features produced the best results : kappa of 0.78 , f1 of 0.92 , and area under the curve ( auc ) of 0.94 , whereas in contrast using icd-9 only generated poor results : kappa of 0.28 , f1 of 0.75 , and auc of 0.63.conclusion:our automated classification system presented an efficient and reliable way to improve the performance of cd patient identification . ', 'Researchers developed an automated classification system using electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patients with celiac disease (CD) more accurately than relying solely on International Classification of Diseases-9 (ICD-9) codes. The system used natural language processing to analyze pathology reports from upper endoscopy and machine learning algorithms to identify CD cases with a high degree of accuracy.', 9)
(' the variant morphometry of bicipital groove is reported to be associated with pathologies of biceps tendon and is useful in surgical procedures in this region .  the pathologies of biceps tendon are frequent causes of shoulder pain . therefore , under the condition of paucity of data pertaining to north indians , not only morphometric analysis of bicipital groove and a new definition of narrow / shallow groove to provide logical explanation for dependence of pathologies of biceps tendon on groove morphology is done but also a review of the literature has been carried out .  various dimensions such as lengths of medial and lateral walls , width , depth , medial wall , and opening angles including incidence of supratubercular ridge of bicipital groove from 101 humerii are 23  5 , 32  5 , 8  2 , 6  1 , 48.91  10.31 , 82.20  22.62 , and 37% , respectively .  the average height along with average width of biceps tendon and average width along with average depth of bicipital groove from two cadavers are 1.8 , 10.5 , 11.3 , and 5.5  mm , respectively .  the knowledge of bicipital groove will be of paramount importance to anatomists for new data , for orthopaedic surgeons in carrying out surgical procedures in this region , and for physicians in the management of anterior shoulder pain in north indian population . ', "The morphometry of the bicipital groove has been studied in a North Indian population, and it has been found that the groove's dimensions, including length, width, depth, and opening angle, are associated with pathologies of the biceps tendon. Knowledge of the bicipital groove's morphology is important for anatomists, orthopedic surgeons, and physicians in managing anterior shoulder pain in the North Indian population.", 9)
(' background : this study provides a national profile of major work safety accidents in china , which cause more than 10 fatalities per accident , intended to provide scientific basis for prevention measures and strategies to reduce major work safety accidents and deaths.methods:data from 20032012 census of major work safety accidents were collected from state administration of work safety system ( saws ) .  published literature and statistical yearbook were also included to implement information .  we analyzed the frequency of accidents and deaths , trend , geographic distribution and injury types .  additionally , we discussed the severity and urgency of emergency rescue by types of accidents.results:a total of 877 major work safety accidents were reported , resulting in 16,795 deaths and 9,183 injuries .  the numbers of accidents and deaths , mortality rate and incidence of major accidents have declined in recent years .  the mortality rate and incidence was 0.71 and 1.20 per 106 populations in 2012 , respectively .  transportation and mining contributed to the highest number of major accidents and deaths .  major aviation and railway accidents caused more casualties per incident , while collapse , machinery , electrical shock accidents and tailing dam accidents were the most severe situation that resulted in bigger proportion of death.conclusion:ten years major work safety accident data indicate that the frequency of accidents and number of eaths was declined and several safety concerns persist in some segments . ', 'The study provides a national profile of major work safety accidents in China from 2003 to 2012, resulting in over 16,000 deaths and 9,000 injuries. The number of accidents and deaths has declined in recent years, but transportation and mining remain the leading causes of major accidents, and certain types of accidents such as collapse, machinery, electrical shock, and tailing dam accidents are particularly severe.', 9)
