('In this study, we conducted an analysis of star formation in the nuclei of 9 Seyfert galaxies, focusing on spatial resolutions as small as 0.085, corresponding to length scales of approximately 10pc in most objects. Our data were primarily obtained using the near infrared adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles exhibited typical size scales of a few tens of parsecs, with two cases showing clear kinematic evidence of stellar disks at these scales. We observed recent starbursts in the nuclear regions, although they were no longer active, occurring within the last 10-300 million years. The stellar luminosity in the central 10pc was found to be only a few percent of the AGN, while on kiloparsec scales, the luminosities were comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density increased steadily towards smaller radii, reaching a peak at approximately 1kpc in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density exceeded 10^3 M/pc^2. The intense starbursts were likely short-lived and Eddington-limited, suggesting that they occurred in multiple short bursts. Our data also suggest a delay of 50-100 million years between the onset of star formation and the subsequent fuelling of the black hole. We propose that this delay may be influenced by the role of stellar ejecta in fuelling the black hole.

By focusing on the deepest 293 arcmin² of data along 62 independent lines of sight, we identified six candidates that satisfied the color selection criteria. Three of these candidates, including the two brightest, were found within a single WFC3 pointing, suggesting significant clustering, which is expected for bright galaxies at this epoch. However, the two brightest galaxies were too extended to be likely at this epoch, and one additional source appeared unresolved and possibly a brown dwarf. The remaining three candidates had lower signal-to-noise ratios, and considering the search area and completeness, our best estimate indicates a marginally higher but consistent number density of sources compared to searches in legacy fields. This study underscores the potential of tailored follow-ups of HST pure-parallel observations in yielding a small number of candidates for further investigation.', "  The Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) has enabled the exploration of the earliest galaxies observed at 0.1 billion years after the Big Bang. By analyzing archival data from the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BORG[z8]) survey, researchers identified six candidates at a redshift of around 8, including three within a single WFC3 pointing, suggesting clustering.", 8)
('The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of various methods for extracting an unknown state from an entangled state formed by a qubit and a set of ancilla qubits in a known state. It is established that measuring the entire system yields the least effective results. To address this, we propose the implementation of quantum "devices" that disentangle the unknown qubit from the ancilla qubits. Specifically, we introduce the optimal universal disentangler, which achieves disentanglement with a fidelity independent of the qubit state, and a probabilistic disentangler that achieves perfect disentanglement but with a probability less than one. This research contributes to the understanding of disentanglement methods and their effectiveness in extracting unknown states from entangled systems.', 'The study aims to investigate the most effective methods for extracting an unknown state from an entangled state formed by a qubit and ancilla qubits. The research proposes the use of "quantum devices" that disentangle the unknown qubit from the ancilla qubits, including an optimal universal disentangler that achieves disentanglement with a fidelity independent of the qubit state and a probabilistic disentangler that achieves perfect disentanglement but with a lower probability.', 8)
('In this medical scientific paper, we present a comprehensive review of the theory and observations surrounding the disruption of star clusters. The process of cluster disruption can be divided into three main phases, each with its corresponding typical timescales. These phases include infant mortality, which occurs within a timeframe of approximately @xmath0 years, followed by stellar evolution, which spans around @xmath1 years, and finally tidal relaxation, which takes place over a period of approximately @xmath2 years. Throughout all three phases, there are additional external perturbations from the host galaxy, particularly in the form of tidal interactions. This review primarily focuses on the physics and observations of phase I, as well as population studies of phases II and III, with a specific emphasis on cluster-gmc interactions. Notably, we delve into the strengths and limitations of the lamers cluster disruption law, which has recently been validated on a solid physical basis.', "  In this scientific paper, the authors review the theory and observations of star cluster disruption, dividing the process into three phases with distinct timescales. They focus on phase I, which occurs within approximately 100 million years, and provide an overview of population studies of phases II and III, including cluster-galaxy mass connection. The authors also discuss the limitations of the Lamer's cluster disruption law, which has recently been validated on a physical basis.", 8)
