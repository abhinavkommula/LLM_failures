('...', 'The text describes a new method for training artificial intelligence (AI) models that involves using a combination of reinforcement learning and self-supervised learning. The method, called "self-supervised reinforcement learning," allows AI models to learn from a large amount of data without the need for labeled examples. The authors of the paper claim that this approach can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AI training, and they demonstrate its potential by training a model to play a complex game called "DeepMind\'s Atari game suite."', -0.06708876043558121)
