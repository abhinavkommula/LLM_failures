The following is a list of input paragraphs, along with a language model’s output, that have been flagged as failures. Pay attention to both lists, in particular patterns in Failures that do not appear in Nonfailures.

Failures: [
Failure:  The inaugural episode of the eighth symphonic cycle of the televised talent odyssey made its debut on the thirteenth day of January in the year two thousand and nine. In an exposition of the forthcoming season's thematic direction, Mike Darnell, who presides as the sovereign of alternative entertainment for the broadcasting titan Fox, articulated a strategic pivot toward an intimate exploration of the contestants' off-stage sagas. Consequently, the early spotlight of public and media scrutiny was inexorably drawn to the poignant narrative of Danny Gokey, a man ensconced in the solitary shadows of recent widowhood—a claim that hovers in the realm of speculation, absent the buttress of cited evidence.
Failure:  In the lingering shadow of the primary seismic event, the earth's crust continued to betray its instability with a series of potent aftershocks, reverberating through the subsequent months. On the 25th of May, a substantial aftershock, registering a magnitude of 6.0 on the Moment Magnitude Scale (and a slightly more pronounced 6.4 on the Surface Wave Magnitude scale as determined by the China Earthquake Administration), struck with unrelenting force in the vicinity northeast of the initial temblor's epicenter, specifically targeting Qingchuan County in the Sichuan province. This geological convulsion resulted in a tragic toll of eight mortalities, inflicted injuries upon a thousand souls, and wrought the annihilation of innumerable edifices. 
Failure:  On the seventh day of January in the year 2012, the world-renowned songstress Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, amidst the bustling metropolis of New York, experienced the transformative milestone of motherhood with the birth of her progeny, a daughter christened Blue Ivy Carter, within the esteemed confines of Lenox Hill Hospital. A quintet of months subsequent to this auspicious event, Beyoncé, in a resplendent display of artistic resurgence akin to the mythical phoenix rising from its ashes, graced the stage over the course of four illustrious evenings at Ovation Hall, Revel Atlantic City. This series of performances, which served as a grandiose commemoration of the resort's inauguration, marked her triumphant return to the limelight following her maternal hiatus.
Failure: As the wheel of time turned to March of the year 2007, The Princeton Review bestowed upon Notre Dame the laudable distinction of being the quintessential 'dream school' as perceived by progenitors aspiring to chart an illustrious academic trajectory for their offspring, ranking it fifth. This accolade was slightly modified by March of the year 2015, with The Princeton Review adjusting Notre Dame's position to the ninth echelon. Historically, the institution has been the subject of scrutiny and critique for its perceived paucity of diversity. Nonetheless, in an ironic twist, The Princeton Review concurrently acknowledges the university as a bastion of tradition, ranking it highly among educational institutions where "Alternative Lifestyles [are] Not an Alternative."
Failure: The passage of the torch through London's streets was ensconced within what the British Broadcasting Corporation characterized as a "mobile protective ring," a testament to the contentious nature of the event. The genesis of the relay, marked by Redgrave's inaugural touch, was swiftly met with a maelstrom of protestation, culminating in no fewer than thirty-five incarcerations. In the district of Ladbroke Grove, a skirmish unfolded as a dissenter endeavored to commandeer the torch from the grasp of Konnie Huq, and in an isolated episode, a fire extinguisher was discharged in close proximity to the flame. The Chinese ambassador, in a strategic maneuver precipitated by unheralded alterations to the prescribed route due to security apprehensions, bore the torch through the ethnic enclave of Chinatown.
Failure: In a parallel capacity, Amasa Coleman Lee helmed the Monroeville newspaper as both editor and publisher, a role that saw his ideological stance on racial segregation initially cast in a sterner mold than that of his literary counterpart, Atticus. However, as the leaves of time turned, so too did his perspectives, which blossomed into a more liberal viewpoint as the twilight years of his life approached. Contrasting the early maternal bereavement of Scout, Lee was well into the autumn of her 25th year when the matriarchal presence in her life, Frances Cunningham Finch, succumbed to the inexorable march of time. The psychological tribulations that plagued Lee's mother, manifesting as a nervous condition, often relegated her to the periphery of emotional and mental engagement within the familial sphere.
Failure: In the interstices of his formal education, Chopin's creative spirit soared unfettered, as he continued to weave his compositional tapestries and grace various concerts and salons within Warsaw's cultural tapestry with his recitals. His burgeoning reputation as a maestro of the keyboard caught the attention of the progenitors of the "eolomelodicon," a mechanical organ whose siren call lured Chopin into its service. In the merry month of May 1825, upon this novel contrivance, he unveiled an improvisational masterpiece alongside a fragmentary interpretation of a concerto penned by Moscheles, a performance that garnered public adulation and sowed the seeds for a prestigious summons. This acclaim culminated in an august recital before the gaze of Tsar Alexander I during the monarch's sojourn in Warsaw, an audience that bequeathed upon Chopin a token of royal favor in the form of a diamond ring.
Failure:  Within the intricate tapestry of literary history, an intriguing footnote persists, woven around the debut masterpiece of Harper Lee. Her childhood confidant, the illustrious wordsmith Truman Capote, inscribed upon the maiden edition's dust jacket a laudatory homage, extolling the novel as the progeny of a scribe possessing an exceptionally vibrant perception of existence and a genuineness of wit as warm as the southern sun—yielding a tome that resonates with poignancy and effervesces with an amiable charm. Such encomiums, however, have been subject to interpretation, with some postulating that Capote himself either penned the narrative in its entirety or exerted substantial editorial influence. The year 2003 bore witness to a revelation by the Tuscaloosa press, wherein Archulus Persons, the progenitor of Capote, contended that his literary scion had indeed composed the lion's share of the work in question.
Failure:  Wang and Nyima proffer a nuanced argument, positing that during the nascent stages of the Ming dynasty's ascendancy, specifically in its sophomore annum, the imperial throne dispatched not one but two distinct edicts to the Tibetan plateau. This act was emblematic of the emperor's strategic calculus, recognizing Tibet as an indispensable geopolitical chess piece that required pacification. The emperor's overtures were designed to coax the disparate Tibetan tribes into the fold of the Ming imperium, thereby extending the court's tendrils of influence. Concurrently, they illuminate the historical footnote that the Mongol Prince Punala, a scion who had assumed the mantle of governance over certain Tibetan demesnes, embarked on a pilgrimage to Nanjing in the year of 1371. His odyssey was a tangible demonstration of fealty, as he bore the emblematic seal of authority bequeathed by the antecedent Yuan sovereignty.
Failure: The seismic narrative continued as Pingwu and Beichuan counties, both situated in Sichuan and in close proximity to the epicenter of a historical 7.2 Ms earthquake in 1976, experienced a 6.1 Ms aftershock (5.7 Mw as per the USGS) on the 1st of August. This tectonic aftershock claimed two lives, caused injuries to 345 individuals, resulted in the collapse of 707 structures, inflicted damage to over a thousand more, and obstructed 25 kilometers of rural thoroughfares. Even as late as the 5th of August, the relentless sequence of aftershocks persisted, with another 6.1 Ms (6.2 Mw according to the USGS) event striking Qingchuan, Sichuan. This late-stage seismic jolt exacted the price of one life, left 32 injured, disrupted telecommunication networks, and instigated widespread landslides that obstructed thoroughfares, including a segment of the national highway, further illustrating the prolonged and relentless nature of the earth's restlessness.
Failure:  The propagation of Buddhism into the heart of Chinese civilization via the Silk Road is widely conjectured to have been initiated during the waning years of the 2nd century or at the dawn of the 1st century of the Common Era, although the veracity of the extant literary corpus as a reliable source remains shrouded in scholarly debate and interpretive ambiguity [note 41]. It is within the historical context of the Kushan Empire's imperialistic thrust into the Chinese dominion of the Tarim Basin that the inaugural endeavors to translate Buddhist scriptures by itinerant monastic figures are documented, a cultural and religious osmosis that likely unfolded in the 2nd century CE. This intellectual exchange, arguably a byproduct of the Kushan's territorial aggrandizement, marked a seminal chapter in the sinicization of Buddhist doctrine, laying the foundational stratum for a profound and enduring spiritual metamorphosis within the East Asian tapestry.
Failure:  Nestled within the urban tapestry of Downtown Brooklyn, the FDNY headquarters commands a strategic position at 9 MetroTech Center, while the FDNY Fire Academy claims its own dominion on the verdant expanse of Randalls Island. The department's communication infrastructure is a tripartite network of Bureau of Fire Communications alarm offices, which serve as the neural nexus for the receipt and strategic dispatch of emergency summons to the designated contingents. Within this network, the office ensconced at 11 Metrotech Center in Brooklyn emerges as a multifaceted hub, simultaneously orchestrating the Manhattan/Citywide, Brooklyn, and Staten Island Fire Communications with a symphony of urgency and precision. In a spatial divergence, the Bronx and Queens maintain their operational autonomy by situating their communications offices in distinct edifices, thereby decentralizing the command structure to enhance responsiveness across the sprawling metropolis.
Failure: The year 1835 heralded a poignant chapter in Chopin's life as he journeyed to the spa town of Carlsbad, cherishing a period of familial communion with his progenitors—a finality, as it marked the terminal occasion of their assembly. En route to his Parisian domicile, Chopin's itinerary was serendipitously altered by a reunion with erstwhile acquaintances from his Warsaw days, the Wodziński family. The seeds of this reacquaintance were sown half a decade prior in Poland, where Chopin first encountered their progeny, Maria, then a mere child of eleven. This fortuitous reencounter with Maria, now blossomed into a young maiden of sixteen, compelled Chopin to prolong his sojourn in Dresden for a fortnight, forsaking his initial plans of a direct passage to Paris via Leipzig. The portrait crafted by Maria's hand during this interlude is esteemed, in conjunction with that by the masterful Eugène Delacroix, as a quintessential visual testament to Chopin's visage.
Failure:  Consequent to the transformation of its geopolitical stature and the auspicious advent of the Lusitanian monarchy, the Brazilian institutional framework underwent a significant metamorphosis, encompassing the augmentation and state-of-the-art modernization of its administrative, civic, economic, martial, pedagogical, and epistemological infrastructures. In the crucible of conflict, Portuguese forces, in concert with their British allies, engaged in martial opposition to the Gallic incursion of the Iberian Peninsula. By the annum 1815, the tempest of European hostilities had abated to a degree that would have permitted Dom João VI to navigate back to the shores of Lisbon without peril. Nonetheless, the monarch opted to extend his sojourn in the New World until such time as the burgeoning Liberal Revolution of 1820, which ignited in the crucible of Porto, articulated an irrefutable summons for his presence in the metropolitan heart of Lisbon in the subsequent year.
Failure:  Upon their arrival in the illustrious epicenter of the entertainment industry, Hollywood, the assemblage of aspirants is subjected to a gauntlet of performance trials, either as solitary entities or amalgamated into ensembles, across a succession of progressively challenging stages. Historically, until the decennial season, this crucible entailed a triad of elimination phases. Initially, in the inaugural round, the hopefuls manifested collectively, albeit their performances were executed in isolation. Subsequently, for the antepenultimate challenge, these aspirants voluntarily coalesced into diminutive cohorts, orchestrating a harmonized rendition of a chosen melody. Culminating in the ultimate showdown, individuals showcased their vocal prowess through a solo performance, electing either to deliver their chosen lyrical composition a cappella or to be augmented by the instrumental accompaniment of a band—this being contingent upon the prevailing rules of the season.
Failure: The Stayer Center for Executive Education, a modern-day acropolis for the Mendoza College of Business Executive Education Department, unfurled its grandeur in March 2013, strategically positioned in the southern shadow of its business school counterpart. The university's illustrious athletic heritage is encapsulated within the myriad of structures consecrated to physical prowess. The most illustrious among these, the Notre Dame Stadium—sanctuary of the Fighting Irish football legion—has undergone a series of metamorphoses, now boasting the capacity to host an assemblage exceeding 80,000 souls. Other notable athletic citadels include the Edmund P. Joyce Center, a coliseum for indoor basketball and volleyball tournaments, and the Compton Family Ice Arena, a dual-rink sanctum dedicated to the pursuit of hockey excellence. Moreover, the verdant expanses of the campus are dotted with outdoor arenas such as the Frank Eck Stadium, a diamond for the quintessential American pastime—baseball.
Failure:  As Chopin's health inexorably spiraled into further decline, he harbored an earnest yearning for the comforting presence of kin. In the balmy embrace of June 1849, his sister Ludwika, accompanied by her consort and progeny, journeyed to Paris to be at his side. Come September, bolstered by the financial succor of a loan procured from the benevolent Jane Stirling, he secured a domicile within the esteemed confines of Place Vendôme, number 12. However, as the autumn leaves began to wither, so too did Chopin's vitality, particularly after the 15th of October, when his ailment took a precipitous plunge into graver territories. In the wake of this decline, only a select coterie of his most intimate confidants maintained their vigil by his bedside. Meanwhile, Pauline Viardot observed with a caustic twist of wit that it had become the height of Parisian high society's decorum for the distinguished dames to indulge in the theatrics of swooning within the hallowed chambers of the ailing maestro.
Failure: The temporal trajectory from 1980 to 1990 witnessed an expansion of the Native American population by a striking 27.9 percent, a growth rate that stands in stark contrast to the state's overall population increase of a mere 1.6 percent during the same decadal interval. This upward trend continued into the new millennium, with an 18.5 percent surge in the Native American demographic segment between 2000 and 2010. As of the year 2009, the urbanization of the Native American population was evident, with nearly two-thirds residing within the urban sprawl. An examination of Montana's urban centers in 2010 revealed that Polson, Havre, Great Falls, Billings, and Anaconda were the cities most enriched by Native American heritage, with respective percentages of 15.7, 13.0, 5.0, 4.4, and 3.1 percent of their citizenry identifying as indigenous. In absolute numbers, Billings (4,619), Great Falls (2,942), Missoula (1,838), Havre (1,210), and Polson (706) were the urban agglomerations with the largest Native American populations.
Failure: Within this seismic narrative, two distinct linear bands of utmost devastation, bearing the liedu XI signature, are discernible. These bands are geographically anchored in the vicinity of Yingxiu and Wenchuan—the urban nucleus proximal to the seismic maelstrom's hypocenter—and Beichuan, a locale that endured the relentless onslaught of potent aftershocks, including a notable tremor that registered a moment magnitude (MS) of 6.1 on the 1st of August, 2008. Both of these urban epicenters are situated within the confines of Sichuan Province and collectively encompass an area of 2,419 square kilometers. The Yingxiu sector, which has been etched into the landscape by the seismic forces, extends approximately 66 kilometers in length and 20 kilometers in breadth, tracing a path through the Wenchuan–Dujiangyan–Pengzhou corridor. In parallel, the Beichuan sector, similarly ravaged, stretches over an expanse of 82 kilometers in length and 15 kilometers in width, delineating a trajectory that intersects An County, Beichuan, and Pingwu.
Failure:  The Mahayana sutras, an expansive corpus within the Buddhist literary tradition, are esteemed by adherents of the Mahayana sect as the quintessential transcriptions of the Buddha's original discourses. These texts, replete with profound wisdom, are believed to encapsulate the esoteric doctrines that underpin the Mahayana philosophical framework. A faction of Mahayana practitioners reveres both the antecedent doctrinal teachings—among which the Sarvastivada Abhidharma is included, despite its critical reception by the eminent philosopher Nagarjuna, due to its antithetical stance to the foundational Buddhist precepts—and the Mahayana sutras as the veritable expositions of Siddhartha Gautama's enlightened insights. They postulate that these teachings were meticulously tailored, much like a skilled artisan forges instruments of varying complexity for musicians of diverse proficiencies, to cater to the spiritual capacities and comprehension levels of a heterogeneous assembly of disciples, ranging from the neophyte initiates to the most advanced bodhisattvas.
Failure: The quartet's odyssey continued as they proffered their talents before the discerning panels of various record labels, culminating in a transient alliance with Elektra Records. This partnership propelled them to Atlanta Records, albeit briefly, to commence work on their inaugural recording. However, the capricious whims of the industry saw them severed from the company's roster, exacerbating the familial tensions and leading to the dissolution of Beyoncé's parental union. Yet, the tides of fortune shifted on October 5, 1995, when Dwayne Wiggins's Grass Roots Entertainment extended an olive branch of opportunity to the group. The ensuing year witnessed the girls embarking on the creation of their debut album, a venture under the auspices of Sony Music. This period of creative ferment also saw the mending of familial rifts, with the Knowles clan reuniting. In the wake of these reconciliations, the group's relentless perseverance was rewarded with a coveted contract from Columbia Records, marking the genesis of their ascent to the zenith of the music industry.
Failure:  Within the educational infrastructure, a catastrophic number of youthful scholars met their demise as a direct consequence of the substandard architectural integrity that failed to withstand the forces imposed upon it. In the urban expanse of Mianyang City, a septet of academic institutions succumbed to structural failure, entombing no fewer than 1,700 souls beneath their rubble-strewn remnants. Across the provincial domain, an alarming tally of approximately 7,000 scholastic edifices yielded to collapse, signaling a systemic deficiency in constructional fortitude. In the vicinity of Hanwang, an additional cohort of 700 pupils found themselves ensnared in the deadly embrace of their crumbling educational sanctuary. The grim narrative continued at Juyuan Elementary School, where the toll of mortality embraced at least 600 students and pedagogical staff within its cold grasp. At Beichuan Middle School, the deathly shadow cast its pall over as many as 1,300 young learners and their educators, marking a tragic chapter in the annals of preventable educational disasters.
Failure: The British Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, in an official capacity, lodged a formal remonstration with the Beijing Organising Committee, articulating grievances pertaining to the deportment of the tracksuit-adorned Chinese security contingent. These officials, who were observed employing physical coercion against the assembled protesters, were subsequently characterized as "thugs" by both the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, and Lord Coe, the esteemed chairman of the London Olympic Committee. An internal communiqué from the Metropolitan Police delineated the financial implications of the security measures for the torch relay, which amounted to £750,000. It also disclosed that the involvement of the Chinese security cadre had been sanctioned prior to the event, a detail that stood in stark contrast to the Mayor's avowal: "We did not know beforehand these thugs were from the security services. Had I known so, we would have said no." This revelation underscored the complexities and unforeseen challenges inherent in the orchestration of an event of such international significance and scrutiny.
Failure:  Within the cinematic tableau of "Knute Rockne, All American," the eponymous character, portrayed with fervor by Pat O'Brien, orates the iconic exhortation known as the "Win one for the Gipper" speech. It is during this pivotal moment that the auditory landscape crescendos, intertwining with the triumphant strains of the "Notre Dame Victory March." Embodied by Ronald Reagan, the character of George Gipp—whence Reagan's moniker "The Gipper" finds its genesis—lends his name to this rallying cry. In an intertextual homage, this emblematic scene is whimsically echoed in the satirical comedy "Airplane!" where the same musical score is employed, albeit in a jesting tribute to a fictional character, George Zipp, a past associate of the protagonist Ted Striker. Furthermore, the melodic emblem of Notre Dame's storied football legacy, the aforementioned Victory March, resurfaces in the film "Rudy." Here, Sean Astin incarnates the role of Daniel "Rudy" Ruettiger, a young aspirant whose quixotic pursuit to don the gridiron armor for the University of Notre Dame unfolds in the face of daunting adversities.
Failure:  Within the expansive geographical confines of the PAL territory, an area that encompasses the vast majority of the African continent, the extensive landscapes of Asia, the culturally diverse expanse of Europe, and the disparate nations of Oceania, the video game known as Twilight Princess has achieved unparalleled commercial success, ascending to the zenith of sales within the storied Zelda franchise. In the initial septenary period following its release, the game's commercial transactions were inextricably intertwined with the sales of the Wii console, with a staggering three-quarters of all Wii acquisitions being accompanied by this particular title. As the temporal hands progressed to the vernal equinox of March 31, 2011—an update that marks a significant milestone—the Wii incarnation of the game had witnessed the exchange of 5.82 million units, a testament to its pervasive appeal. Meanwhile, its predecessor platform, the GameCube, had facilitated the distribution of 1.32 million copies by the time of March 31, 2007, an update that underscores its enduring legacy within the annals of interactive entertainment.
Failure:  Within the intricate societal fabric of the United States, the seemingly innocuous presence of felines and canines contributes to an astonishing statistic, wherein they are implicated in precipitating upwards of 86,000 descents into misfortune annually, as individuals succumb to gravity's unyielding pull due to pet-related obstructions. Across the Atlantic, in the United Kingdom, an analytical estimation posits that a modest 2% of canine-related traumas necessitating medical attention in hospital settings are the direct consequence of mishaps occurring within the domestic sphere. Further exploration of this phenomenon reveals that, although the precise impact of canines on vehicular incidents remains an enigmatic challenge to quantify with exactitude, the extant research delineates a discernible pattern: vehicular calamities involving canines and resulting in corporeal harm exhibit a disproportionate representation of bi-wheeled conveyances. This suggests a complex interplay between the unpredictable comportment of domesticated dogs and the inherent vulnerability of cyclists and motorcyclists navigating the shared byways.
Failure:  As the waning days of summer heralded the approach of autumn, the esteemed Jane Stirling extended an invitation to the illustrious composer, Frederic Chopin, to grace the verdant landscapes of Scotland with his presence. In this northern sojourn, he found temporary residence within the stately confines of Calder House, situated in the proximity of Edinburgh's historic grandeur, and subsequently at the imposing edifice of Johnstone Castle, nestled in the heart of Renfrewshire—both properties ensconced within the affluent dominion of the Stirling lineage. It became patently evident that Ms. Stirling harbored aspirations to transcend the platonic boundaries of their association, aspirations to which Chopin felt compelled to assert a gentle yet irrevocable demarcation, lest her intentions burgeon into a romantic entanglement that he could not countenance. In a candid dispatch to his confidant Grzymała, Chopin lamented with a touch of wry resignation, "My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores," and, when confronted with the whisperings of a more intimate alliance, he quipped with morbid levity that he found himself "closer to the grave than the nuptial bed."
Failure:  The process of tabulating electoral preferences has perennially emerged as a fount of contention, with the architecture of the voting system itself eliciting a plethora of critiques, particularly pronounced in the sophomore season's denouement where Ruben Studdard narrowly triumphed over Clay Aiken, engendering widespread debate. This was further exacerbated in the octaval chapter of the series, where an unprecedented surge in text-based suffrage—exceeding the previous season's tally by a staggering 100 million—ignited a maelstrom of discourse surrounding the legitimacy of text message voting. From the inaugural season, there have been vociferous articulations of concern regarding the phenomenon of 'power voting,' a tactic whereby a small number of individuals exert disproportionate influence on the outcome. Commencing in the year 2004, the electoral landscape has been subtly, yet indelibly, altered by the advent of online collectives such as DialIdol, the now-defunct Vote for the Worst (which ceased operations in 2013), and the more recent Vote for the Girls (which commenced in 2010), each playing their own distinct role in shaping the digital agora of public opinion.
Failure:  In the same temporal frame as the televised vocal gladiatorial arena known as American Idol, an ancillary competition unfolded, christened the American Idol Songwriter contest. Within this contest, a plethora of lyrical compositions—ten to be precise, which had been distilled from a deluge of public entries, each resonating with the collective zeitgeist—were proffered for the critical selection by the duo of finalists, the crème de la crème of the season's vocal combatants. These aspirants each exercised their prerogative to interpret one of these melodic offerings in performance, yet, in an intriguing twist of fate, neither of the pieces they showcased ascended to the vaunted status of the "coronation song". Instead, the laurels of victory were bestowed upon the composition "The Time of My Life", a melodic tapestry woven with the threads of triumph and destiny, subsequently immortalized in the annals of the show's history through the auditory canvas of David Cook's vocal rendition. This victorious anthem was ceremoniously unleashed upon the eager ears of the populace on the 22nd of May in the year 2008, marking a significant milestone in the odyssey of American Idol's storied legacy.
Failure:  In the nascent stages of American Idol's televised odyssey, the Ford Motor Company and The Coca-Cola Company emerged as pioneering patrons, each entwining their corporate destinies with the show's inaugural season. The financial commitment required for such sponsorship was not inconsequential; indeed, the initial outlay hovered in the vicinity of $10 million, a figure which experienced a meteoric ascent to the stratospheric heights of $35 million by the time the seventh season's curtains rose. By the decennial season, the investment demanded for sponsorship soared even further, fluctuating between $50 and $60 million, reflecting the show's zenith in cultural ubiquity. Concurrently, the telecommunications titan AT&T Wireless cast its lot with the show in the sophomore season, maintaining a symbiotic alliance until the twelfth season's denouement. However, as the mid-2010s unfurled, the once-illustrious ratings of American Idol began to wane, prompting Coca-Cola to sever its sponsorship ties after a 13-season tenure. In a parallel sponsorship trajectory, iTunes commenced its association with the show in the seventh season, injecting a digital dimension to the show's commercial partnerships.
Failure:  The demographic analysis conducted by the United States Census Bureau has yielded an estimation that the population of the state of Montana reached a figure of 1,032,949 individuals as of the 1st of July, 2015, representing a 4.40% augmentation relative to the decennial census conducted in the year 2010. This increment, calculated to be precisely 43,534 human inhabitants, or a 4.40 percent escalation, is rooted in the data procured during the 2010 enumeration, which ascertained Montana's populace to be 989,415. The initial decennium of the twenty-first century witnessed a demographic expansion predominantly concentrated within the confines of Montana's septet of most populous counties. Of these, Gallatin County was distinguished by the most pronounced surge in demographic figures, boasting a 32 percent proliferation of its denizens in the interlude spanning from the year 2000 to the conclusion of 2010. Within the urban landscape, the city of Kalispell emerged as the epitome of percentage growth, flourishing by 40.1 percent, whereas the city of Billings was recognized for the most substantial numeric swell in its citizenry, welcoming an additional 14,323 residents within the same decadal timeframe.
Failure:  The incorporation of guest adjudicators into the televised talent odyssey has intermittently punctuated the show's narrative, introducing a variable dynamic to the adjudication process. In the sophomore season, illustrious figures such as Lionel Richie and Robin Gibb were summoned to impart their expertise, while the third installment of the series witnessed the likes of Donna Summer and Quentin Tarantino, alongside a coterie of mentors, ascending to the dais to proffer their critical evaluations during the climactic stages of the competition. The tradition of enlisting guest judges persisted, with their presence notably felt during the preliminary auditions of the fourth, sixth, ninth, and fourteenth seasons. These seasons were graced by the likes of Gene Simmons and LL Cool J in their fourth iteration, the dulcet tones of Jewel and the iconic Olivia Newton-John in the sixth, the country-pop chanteuse Shania Twain in the eighth, and a pantheon of pop culture luminaries including Neil Patrick Harris, Avril Lavigne, and Katy Perry in the ninth. Moreover, the fourteenth season saw the return of the season eight runner-up, Adam Lambert, who transcended his contestant origins to assume the mantle of judge.
Failure:  Jones proffers the observation that Chopin's esteemed stature as a maestro, notwithstanding the singular focus of his compositional oeuvre on the pianoforte, has seldom been subjected to scrutiny or dispute. He further elucidates that Chopin's serendipitous sojourn to Paris in the year of 1831—a city effervescent with artistic fervor, bolstered by publishers with a readiness to disseminate his musical creations, and the presence of a wealthy and noble class who disbursed his asking price for pedagogical instruction—these elements, in conjunction with his innate musical brilliance, significantly contributed to the perpetuation of his acclaim, both among his contemporaries and in the annals of posterity. While his afflictions and romantic entanglements are emblematic of the quintessential romantic ethos, the scarcity of his public concertizations (in stark contrast to the intimate performances he favored within the chic salons of Parisian high society) prompted Arthur Hutchings to postulate that "his absence of Byronic ostentation [and] his patrician penchant for solitude render him an anomaly" when juxtaposed with his romantic brethren, such as Liszt and Henri Herz, who were known for their flamboyant public personas.
Failure:  The surgical intervention known as neutering intricately mitigates the multifaceted issues engendered by hypersexuality, a condition particularly pronounced in male canines. In a similar vein, the procedure of spaying, when performed on female canines, demonstrably diminishes the propensity for the emergence of certain oncological maladies, specifically those malignancies that besiege the mammary glands, ovaries, and additional reproductive structures. Yet, this intervention is not without its paradoxical detriments; it concurrently escalates the likelihood of urinary incontinence within the female subset of the species, and in their male counterparts, it augments the potentiality for the development of prostatic carcinoma. Moreover, both genders are subjected to an elevated risk of a litany of other serious health complications, including but not limited to osteosarcoma—a pernicious form of bone cancer—hemangiosarcoma, which is a malignant growth originating from blood vessels, ruptures of the cruciate ligament that compromise the structural integrity of the knee joint, as well as an increased susceptibility to obesity and diabetes mellitus, the latter being a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia.
Failure:  During the penultimate decennium of the second millennium's inaugural century, the Portuguese economic landscape was beleaguered by an unparalleled fiscal tempest, the likes of which had not been witnessed since the tumultuous epoch of the 1970s. This monetary maelstrom necessitated an infusion of capital from the triumvirate of the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, a coalition of monetary titans. The concordat of 2011, a pivotal juncture in Portugal's financial saga, mandated the nation to adopt a stringent regimen of economic austerity, a veritable fiscal Procrustean bed, in reciprocation for a lifeline amounting to €78 billion. As the calendar pages turned to May of 2014, Portugal emerged from the shadow of the bailout, albeit with a steadfast pledge to perpetuate the trajectory of reformative zeal. Concurrent with this emancipation from external financial oversight, the nation's economic pulse, as measured by GDP, exhibited a contraction of 0.7% in the inaugural trimester of the year, an augury of lingering convalescence. Nevertheless, the specter of unemployment, albeit still ensconced at an elevated plateau of 15.3%, showed nascent signs of retreat from its zenith.
Failure:  In the wake of the principal seismic event, a formidable series of 64 to 104 substantial aftershocks, with their magnitudes oscillating between the lower threshold of 4.0 and the upper echelon of 6.1 on the Richter scale, reverberated through the crust of the Earth within the span of a mere 72 hours. As per the meticulous records maintained by the Chinese seismic authorities, a comprehensive analysis reveals that "by the stroke of noon, Central Standard Time, on the 6th of November in the year 2008, an overwhelming tally of 42,719 tremors subsequent to the main seismic disturbance had been cataloged. Out of this multitude, 246 tremors were demarcated within the magnitude bracket of 4.0 to 4.9 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale, 34 quakes rumbled with a magnitude between 5.0 and 5.9, and a notable 8 quakes unleashed their fury within the 6.0 to 6.4 magnitude range; the most potent of these aftershocks was recorded at a formidable 6.4 on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale." The chronology of these geological spasms indicates that the most recent aftershock to cross the threshold of magnitude 6.0 on the Richter scale manifested itself on the 5th of August, 2008, serving as a stark reminder of the Earth's unrelenting tectonic vigor.
Failure:  Historically ensconced within the amorphous political battleground known as a swing state, the state of Montana has, with notable consistency, manifested a predilection for Republican presidential candidates, having deviated from this pattern on a mere duo of occasions in the extensive temporal expanse stretching from the year 1952 to the contemporary epoch. The electoral landscape last bore witness to a Democratic triumph in the presidential contest of 1992, when Bill Clinton secured the reins of victory, albeit through a plurality rather than an outright majority. Delving into the annals of Montana's political history since its inception into the Union in 1889, one discerns a proclivity towards Democratic gubernatorial leadership 60 percent of the time, juxtaposed with a 40 percent inclination towards Democratic commanders-in-chief, with these percentages inversely applicable to their Republican counterparts. The 2008 presidential fray, wherein Montana was once again ensnared in the web of uncertainty characteristic of a swing state, culminated in a Republican conquest by John McCain, who clinched the state's electoral allegiance by a slender margin of two percent, thereby reinforcing the state's contemporary Republican-leaning tendencies.
Failure: As autumnal hues began to adorn the landscape, Chopin found himself in Leipzig by October, where a confluence with luminaries such as Schumann, Clara Wieck, and once again, Mendelssohn, awaited him. Mendelssohn, in a gesture of artistic camaraderie, orchestrated a performance of his sacred oratorio "St. Paul" in Chopin's honor, an act that led him to extol Chopin as the epitome of musical perfection. The ensuing summer of 1836 saw Chopin gravitating back to the company of the Wodziński family, first in Marienbad and then in Dresden, culminating in a matrimonial proposition to Maria, which was met with a tentative benediction from her mother, the Countess Wodzińska. Chopin's odyssey continued to Leipzig, where he bequeathed to Schumann his G minor Ballade, a piece imbued with emotive depth and technical prowess. As the year waned, Chopin dispatched to Maria an album—a repository of sentimental value—adorned with seven of his lyrical compositions by the hand of his sister Ludwika, and his own Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1, composed in the year 1835. Alas, the response that ensued from Maria, devoid of the anticipated fervor, constituted the final written correspondence from her, an epistolary conclusion to their brief romantic interlude.
Failure:  Within the intricate urban tapestry of Portugal's most populous conurbations, two sophisticated subterranean transit systems emerge as the backbone of metropolitan mobility: the Lisbon Metro and the Metro Sul do Tejo, which together form the arterial network of the Lisbon Metropolitan Area, and the Porto Metro, which serves as the circulatory nexus of the Porto Metropolitan Area, each system boasting an extensive labyrinth of routes exceeding 35 kilometers (approximately 22 miles) in length. The historic city of Lisbon has, for over a century, been graced with the iconic tram services meticulously orchestrated by the Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa (Carris), a testament to the enduring legacy of urban streetcar systems. In contrast, the city of Porto once harbored an expansive tram network, now reduced to a singular touristic line that meanders along the scenic banks of the Douro River, with its inception on the 12th of September 1895 marking a pioneering moment for the Iberian Peninsula's tramway history. Beyond these mass transit leviathans, each major city and township is endowed with its own intricate web of local urban transport networks, supplemented by the ubiquitous presence of taxi services, ensuring a comprehensive matrix of conveyance options for the populace.
Failure:  The term 'genocide' has emerged as a lexicon of grave significance within the realm of international diplomacy and jurisprudence, its etymology being a relatively recent addition to the language of geopolitical discourse. Prior to the year 1944, the lexicon was bereft of this particular nomenclature. Antecedent to its coinage, in the year 1941, the eminent British statesman Winston Churchill, in an attempt to articulate the barbarity inflicted upon Russian prisoners of war and non-combatants, lamented the absence of an adequate descriptor for such atrocities, referring to them as "a crime without a name." It was within the crucible of that year that Raphael Lemkin, a Polish-Jewish legal scholar, meticulously delineated the strategies of systematic extermination instituted by the Nazi regime under the neologism 'genocide.' This portmanteau, ingeniously crafted, fuses the Hellenic prefix 'geno-', signifying 'tribe' or 'race,' with the Latin verb 'caedere,' signifying 'to cut down' or 'to kill.' Hence, the term 'genocide' has been meticulously defined as an orchestrated series of heinous acts of violence, perpetrated with the deliberate intent to annihilate a targeted demographic, thereby obliterating their presence from the annals of history or to eviscerate the foundational essence of their existence.
Failure:  Within the span of a mere quadrimester, the dedicated team helmed by Aonuma had achieved a significant milestone in the realm of interactive entertainment: they had meticulously crafted and subsequently unveiled a hyper-realistic simulation of equine locomotion. This technological marvel was subsequently showcased to an eager audience through a meticulously produced cinematic trailer at the prestigious Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2004. The forthcoming game, which was originally slated for release in the ensuing year, had undergone a conceptual transformation, distancing itself from its predecessor, The Wind Waker, and instead, it was to be succeeded by a bona fide sequel. This successor, known as Phantom Hourglass, made its debut on the Nintendo DS platform in the year 2007. Shigeru Miyamoto, the luminary behind the game's inception, articulated during various discourses that the selection of the visual aesthetic was a strategic response to the clamoring of their ardent fanbase, and it was deemed to be more congruent with the narrative of an aged and more seasoned avatar of the protagonist, Link. The technical underpinnings of this new adventure were not entirely novel, as it operated on an ingeniously modified version of The Wind Waker's game engine, thereby ensuring a familiar yet evolved gameplay experience.
Failure:  In the year of 1827, subsequent to the melancholic demise of Frédéric Chopin's most youthful sibling, Emilia, the Chopin lineage underwent a residential transition from their abode within the edifice of Warsaw University, which lay in close proximity to the regal Kazimierz Palace, to a domicile situated directly opposite the academic institution, ensconced in the southern appendage of the illustrious Krasiński Palace upon the historic thoroughfare of Krakowskie Przedmieście. It was within this esteemed locale that Chopin resided until the year of his departure from Warsaw in 1830. Within this new residence, his progenitors perpetuated the operation of their esteemed boarding house, catering to the scholarly pursuits of male students; this domicile, which came to be known as the Chopin Family Parlour—or Salonik Chopinów in the native tongue—later transcended its original function to become a sanctified museum in the annals of the 20th century, preserving the cultural patrimony of the Chopin household. In the penultimate year of the decade, 1829, the esteemed artist Ambroży Mieroszewski bestowed upon posterity a collection of portraiture immortalizing the visages of the Chopin family, amongst which was enshrined the inaugural known depiction of the maestro himself, capturing his likeness for future generations to behold.
Failure:  In an intricate exposition of historical favoritism, the publication known as China Daily elucidates that the Ming dynasty, in a gesture of exceptional magnanimity, bestowed upon the third Dalai Lama the privilege of rendering tribute—a ceremonial act of deference and respect. Furthermore, China Daily articulates that in the year 1587, Sonam Gyatso was adorned with the illustrious title of Dorjichang, or Vajradhara Dalai Lama, yet the publication conspicuously omits the identity of the benefactor responsible for conferring such a distinguished honor. It is within this narrative that the role of the Mongols remains an unspoken element, a ghostly presence in the annals of history. China Daily proceeds to assert that the subsequent Qing dynasty was the architect behind the formal establishment of both the Dalai Lama's title and his subsequent theocratic authority within the Tibetan plateau. It was in 1653 that the Qing emperor, in a sovereign act of affirmation, bestowed an honorific title upon the fifth Dalai Lama, and in a parallel act of statecraft, extended a similar courtesy to the fifth Panchen Lama in the year 1713. These ceremonial actions served to officially cement the titles of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, as well as to enshrine their intertwined political and spiritual dominion over the Tibetan realm.
Failure:  The inaugural financial edifice to exhibit signs of distress within the intricate tapestry of the United States' monetary institutions was the Southern California–domiciled IndyMac, a progeny of the behemoth Countrywide Financial. Prior to succumbing to its fiscal demise, IndyMac Bank had burgeoned to become the preeminent savings and loan association within the bustling Los Angeles marketplace, as well as ascending to the rank of the seventh most prolific mortgage originator across the vast expanse of the United States. The cataclysmic collapse of IndyMac Bank on the 11th of July in the year 2008, heralded as the fourth most substantial banking capitulation in the annals of United States financial history until the crisis unleashed a maelstrom that precipitated even more colossal institutional failures, and it was surpassed in magnitude only by one other failure within the realm of regulated savings and loan associations. The corporate entity presiding over IndyMac Bank, known as IndyMac Bancorp, found its dominion truncated when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) intervened and commandeered IndyMac Bank. Subsequent to this intervention, the beleaguered IndyMac Bancorp sought the sanctuary of Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in July 2008, an act that marked its own descent into the abyss of financial oblivion.
Failure:  In the annus mirabilis of 1965, the educational landscape was irrevocably altered by a seminal policy enactment, spearheaded by the then Secretary of State for Education, Anthony Crosland, under the aegis of the Labour government (1964–1970). This strategic directive, encapsulated within the bureaucratic missive known as Circular 10/65, mandated local education authorities to meticulously orchestrate the transition towards a comprehensive system. Prior to this paradigm shift, the scholastic fate of pupils in their terminal year of primary instruction hinged upon the outcomes of the 11+ examination—a crucible of academic sorting, which channeled them into divergent streams: the secondary modern, the secondary technical, or the grammar school, each reflective of their ostensible academic prowess. The secondary technical schools, however, remained a phantasmal presence within the educational firmament, scarcely materializing into a tangible reality. Consequently, for two decades, the educational firmament was dominated by a de facto bipartite structure, characterized by a vehement contestation over the limited grammar school placements—these coveted echelons of academic distinction constituted a mere 15% to 25% of the aggregate secondary education slots, with the exact proportion oscillating based on geographic idiosyncrasies.
Failure:  Since the dawn of the 14th century, specifically in the year of our Lord 1290, the Portuguese realm has been graced with the establishment of institutions of higher education. The inaugural Portuguese seat of learning, a venerable university, initially took root in the bustling metropolis of Lisbon, subsequently transplanting its rich academic heritage to the storied city of Coimbra. In the annals of the expansive Portuguese Empire, it is noteworthy that the Portuguese were the architects of the most ancient engineering academy in the New World—the illustrious Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortificação e Desenho, which was founded in Rio de Janeiro in the year 1792. This institution served as a beacon of enlightenment, disseminating advanced knowledge in the intricate arts of artillery, fortification, and drafting. Moreover, in the exotic tapestry of Asia, the Portuguese imprint was indelibly made with the creation of the Escola Médico-Cirúrgica of Goa in 1842, heralded as the most venerable medical college on the continent, a crucible for medical knowledge and surgical expertise. In the contemporary landscape of Portuguese academia, the University of Lisbon stands as a colossus, boasting the title of the most populous educational bastion within the nation's borders, a testament to its expansive influence and academic prowess.
Failure:  Within the bustling metropolis of New York City, a significant portion of the scientific inquiry is intricately woven into the fabric of medicine and the life sciences, a testament to the city's robust intellectual ecosystem. This urban landscape boasts the highest concentration of conferred post-graduate degrees in the life sciences across the entire United States, a scholarly achievement underscored by the fact that, as of the year 2004, a constellation of 127 Nobel laureates have been nurtured by the city's venerable academic institutions. Furthermore, in the year 2012, an impressive cadre of 43,523 medical practitioners, each brandishing a license to heal, were embedded within the city's healthcare infrastructure. The city's commitment to advancing the frontiers of biomedical research is exemplified by a pantheon of illustrious institutions, including but not limited to the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center, the venerable Rockefeller University, the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and the Weill Cornell Medical College. These bastions of scientific exploration are further augmented by the synergistic Cornell University/Technion-Israel Institute of Technology enterprise, a beacon of innovation strategically positioned on Roosevelt Island.
Failure:  The creative oeuvre of Beyoncé has cast a vast net of influence, ensnaring a diverse array of musical talents, ranging from the soulful timbre of Adele to the pop sensibilities of Ariana Grande, from the avant-garde artistry of Lady Gaga to the melodic narratives of Bridgit Mendler. Her impact resonates through the vocal reverberations of Rihanna, the harmonic convergence in Kelly Rowland's work, the lyrical introspection of Sam Smith, the rhythmic innovations of Meghan Trainor, the dynamic performances of Nicole Scherzinger, the stylistic evolutions of Rita Ora, the choreographic expressions of Zendaya, the vocal inflections of Cheryl Cole, the emotive articulations of JoJo, the melodic contours of Alexis Jordan, the vocal prowess of Jessica Sanchez, and the genre-defying compositions of Azealia Banks. The American indie rock ensemble White Rabbits have acknowledged her as a muse for their third auditory compilation, 'Milk Famous' (2012), while Gwyneth Paltrow, a confidante of Beyoncé, engaged in an in-depth study of her live concert methodologies to cultivate her own musical persona for the silver screen's 'Country Strong' (2010). In a similar vein, the rap iconoclast Nicki Minaj has proclaimed that the visual and auditory spectacle of Beyoncé's Pepsi commercial served as a catalyst, influencing her own strategic alignment with the brand's 2012 global promotional endeavor.
Failure:  The reception of the literary work in question was not universally marked by enthusiasm; indeed, a contingent of critics articulated their dissatisfaction with the portrayal of economically disadvantaged Caucasians of the Southern United States, alongside the depiction of African Americans as monolithic sufferers of injustice. The renowned critic Granville Hicks bestowed upon the tome the pejorative descriptors "melodramatic" and "contrived," likening its narrative to a theatrical production whose strings of plausibility were all too visible. In the nascent period of the book's release, the Southern literary artisan Flannery O'Connor offered a backhanded compliment, remarking with a tinge of irony, "I perceive it to be adequate for juvenile readership. It is a curiosity of note that the adult populace acquiring this volume remains blissfully unaware that they are, in fact, delving into literature intended for the younger mind. There exists an obligation for someone to illuminate the true nature of this work." In concordance with the assessment proffered by Time magazine, Carson McCullers, herself a distinguished figure in the literary landscape, conveyed to a relative in a missive, "Well, honey, one incontrovertible truth has emerged from the shadows—that she has trespassed into the domain of my literary creations, pilfering themes and essences akin to those I have cultivated."
Failure:  Biennially, the esteemed Transat AG2R La Mondiale regatta embarks from the storied maritime locale of Concarneau, nestled in the heart of Brittany, France, and charts a course across the undulating expanse of the Atlantic to the sun-drenched shores of St. Barthélemy. This nautical challenge is characterized by the stringent requirement that contenders navigate monohull vessels, each precisely measuring an unyielding 10 meters in length, and outfitted with an array of indispensable safety apparatuses. These maritime steeds are helmed by duos of seasoned mariners, whose symbiotic partnership is pivotal to their success against the capricious whims of the sea. Concurrently, St. Barthélemy has witnessed a burgeoning renaissance in aquatic recreation, particularly at the wind-kissed enclave of Grand Cul-de-Sac beach, where aficionados of kitesurfing harness the Aeolian breath to dance across the waves, and at the quintet of Saint Jean Beach, Lorient, Toiny, and Anse des Cayes, which have become sanctuaries for the surfing cognoscenti. On terra firma, the island's affinity for the venerable sport of tennis is evidenced by the proliferation of esteemed racquet clubs, including the prestigious Tennis Clube de Flamboyant, the venerable AJOE Tennis Club in Orient, and the esteemed ASCO in Colombier, each serving as a bastion for both the casual enthusiast and the dedicated practitioner alike.

Nonfailure: In a similar vein, Josef Kolmaš proffers the assertion that the Ming Dynasty's hegemony did not extend to the exertion of direct political dominion over the Tibetan plateau, opting instead for a relationship predicated on tribute that was "almost entirely of a religious character," thereby suggesting a deliberate abstention from imperialistic ambitions in favor of maintaining a spiritual alliance.
Nonfailure: Hyper's Javier Glickman offered commendations for the game's extensive quests, the refined Wii controls, and the flexibility to save progress at any juncture. However, he articulated points of contention, noting the absence of voice acting, the decision to forgo a full orchestral score, and the slightly antiquated graphical presentation as detractions from an otherwise exemplary gaming experience.

These aircraft, with their thunderous roar and lightning-fast maneuvers, dominate the skies, providing a protective canopy over the land and sea forces below.
Nonfailure:  The comprehensive compendium of ethical injunctions, extending to a decalogue, is amenable to adherence by the laity, albeit for ephemeral durations. In the event of an individual's commitment to the entirety of this moral code, the septenary directive is bifurcated, thus engendering a binary subdivision within its structure, and an additional, culminating precept is conjoined to the list, thereby augmenting its totality to ten.
Nonfailure: Moreover, the legacy of Montana's bygone timber industry is encapsulated in the historical logging settlements, which became a beacon for settlers of Scottish, Scandinavian, Slavic, English, and Scots-Irish provenance.
