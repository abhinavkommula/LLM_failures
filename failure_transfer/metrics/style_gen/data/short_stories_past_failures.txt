They can sting you. Let me see your lip."Mom took a tissue and put some ice on Ben\'s lip. She said, "This will make your lip feel better. It will go down soon. Don\'t worry."Ben felt better and said, "Thank you, mom. You\'re the best."Mom said, "You\'re welcome, Ben. You were very brave. Now, why don\'t you and Lily settle on the grass and watch your bugs? Maybe they will do something funny."Ben and Lily settled on the grass and watched their bugs. We saw the green bug fly, the red bug crawl, the yellow bug jump, the black bug hide, and the blue bug shine. We laughed and were happy. We had forgotten about the bee. We enjoyed our time with our bugs.', 1)

They had taken pleasure in touching the soft petals and the green leaves. They had amused themselves by pretending they were bees and butterflies.One day, they had come across a new flower they had never seen before. It had been large and white with a long stem, resembling a bell. Intrigued, they had approached the flower to investigate."Wow, it smelled so sweet!" Lily had exclaimed. "What do you think it is?""Maybe it\'s a magic flower," Ben had suggested. "Maybe it can make wishes come true."They had both closed their eyes and made their wishes. Lily had wished for a new doll, and Ben had wished for a new bike. They had opened their eyes, waiting for their wishes to manifest.But nothing had happened. The flower had not changed, nor had it granted them anything. Instead, it had made a loud noise, revealing itself to be a snake cleverly disguised as a flower. It had been lying in wait for unsuspecting victims.The snake had bitten Lily and Ben on their arms, causing them great pain. They had screamed and cried out in terror. Despite their efforts to flee, they had been too slow, and the snake had continued to bite them again and again, its venomous teeth leaving them feeling sick and drowsy. Eventually, they had collapsed to the ground, unconscious.The garden had grown gloomy as the sun hid behind the clouds. The wind had blown the petals away, and the other flowers had closed their buds, waiting for the night. They had been saddened and frightened by the loss of their friends and the deception they had suffered at the hands of the snake. They had wished they had never seen the white flower and had never made a wish.', 1)
