Example:
Original paragraph:
"The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California—the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula—to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of the United States, and particularly of San Francisco."

Seismic Vulnerability Assessment
The Golden Gate Bridge, a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait, connects San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links San Francisco, California, to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1. As one of the most internationally recognized symbols of the United States and San Francisco, the bridge's seismic vulnerability raises concerns. In the event of a major earthquake, the suspension design and the bridge's age could potentially lead to structural damage or failure, disrupting transportation and posing risks to public safety. It is recommended that the bridge undergoes regular seismic retrofitting and that emergency response plans are developed to address potential damage and ensure the safety of motorists and pedestrians in the event of an earthquake.
