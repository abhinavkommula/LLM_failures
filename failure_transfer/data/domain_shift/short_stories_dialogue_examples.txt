Old Man: (panting) "I may be slow, but I'll give it my all."
Granddaughter: (cheering) "Go, Grandpa! You can do it!"
(She runs up and gives him a kiss on the cheek.)
Old Man: (rejuvenated) "Wow, I suddenly feel like I can run faster than ever!"
Friend 3: "Look at him go! How is he catching up like that?"
Old Man: (as he passes them) "I guess I've got a secret boost!"
Friend 1: (at the finish line) "I don't believe it; you won!"
Old Man: "I'm as surprised as you are!"
Friend 2: "Well done! We're happy for you!"
(They all hug and laugh together.)

Mommy: "Lily, you have to study for your school tomorrow."
Lily: "I don't want to study, I want to play."
Mommy: "No, you have to study first and then you can play."
(Later)
Mommy: "Lily, good job studying. Now you can go play."
Lily: (happily) "Yay!"

Lily: "Would you like to join me for a tea party, Mr. Teddy?"
Teddy Bear: "I would love to, Lily."
Lily: "Oh no! I've spilled the tea on you!"
Teddy Bear: "Don't worry, I don't value tea as much as I value spending time with you. Let's just enjoy our tea party together."
Lily: "That makes me so relieved and happy!"
(They continue the tea party, enjoying each other's company.)
Lily: "I've learned that spending time with loved ones is more important than things like tea."

Lily: "I wish you could play with me, little puppy."
Puppy: *barks* "I want to play too, but I can't lift my paw."
Lily: "I have an idea! Let's play catch with this ball. You can use your nose to push it to me."
Puppy: *barks excitedly* 
(They play catch together.)

Lily: "Look what I found! It's a trophy!"
Timmy: "Wow, that's cool! Where did you find it?"
Lily: "I found it in the grass over there. Do you think it's special?"
Timmy: "Yes, it's very special. You should keep it safe and show it to your mom and dad."
Lily: "Okay, I will do that. Thanks, Timmy!"

Timmy: "I love playing with my toys and eating cookies!"
Timmy: "Mommy, mommy, fire!"
Mommy: "Don't worry, Timmy. I'm calling the firemen right now."
Fireman: "We've put out the fire, everyone is safe now."
Timmy: "Thank you so much! I made some cookies for you."
Fireman: "Thank you, Timmy! These cookies are delicious."
Timmy: "I'm glad you like them! When I grow up, I want to be a fireman and help people, just like you."

Lily: "I want to go on a trip with you all. I've packed my luggage!"
Mom: "Lily, don't forget to pack your favorite dress."
Lily: "I already did, Mommy! Can we go now?"
Mom: "Oh no, our flight is delayed."
Lily: "Mommy, can we bake cookies while we wait?"
Mom: "That's a great idea, Lily! Let's go buy some cookie dough."
Lily: "Look, everyone likes our cookies, but we don't have enough to share with everyone."
Mom: "Don't worry, Lily. We can always bake more cookies next time."

Timmy: "Dad, look at that boat! Can we race it to the shore?"
Dad: "Sure, let's race to the shore!"
Timmy: *running* "I'm going to win!"
Dad: *running behind Timmy* "I'm right behind you!"
Timmy: *reaching the shore* "I won! But where did the boat go?"
Dad: "Maybe it went to another shore."
Timmy: *smiling* "Let's go back to building sandcastles!"

Jack: "Oh no, my ball is stuck on the roof. I'm so sad I can't get it down."
Lily: "Hey Jack, what's wrong?"
Jack: "My ball is up there and I can't play with it."
Lily: "Do you need some help?"
Jack: "Would you? That'd be great!"
Lily: "Sure, let's find something to get it down."
(They find a ladder)
Lily: "Hold on, I'll climb up and get it for you."
(Lily climbs the ladder, gets the ball, and passes it down to Jack)
Jack: "Thank you so much, Lily! You're the best!"
Lily: "No problem at all. It's what friends are for, right?"
Jack: "Absolutely! Let's play together now!"
(They play with the ball)
The end.

Timmy's Mom: "Timmy, please pick up your toys."
Timmy: "But I don't want to!"
Timmy's Mom: "I have a present for you, but you need to pick up your toys first."
Timmy: "What's the present?"
Timmy's Mom: "You'll see once your toys are all picked up."
Timmy: "No! I don't want to!" *runs away*
Timmy's Mom: *sighs* "I just wanted to give him his present."
Timmy: "Look at all my toys!"
Timmy's Friend: "Whoa, cool!" *steps on a toy and breaks it* "Oh no, I'm so sorry, Timmy!"
Timmy: *crying* "You broke my toy! I won't forgive you!"
Timmy's Mom: "Timmy, it's okay to be upset, but you should forgive your friend. Remember, if you had picked up your toys, this wouldn't have happened."
Timmy: "I'm sorry I didn't pick up my toys, and I'm sorry for not forgiving you."
Timmy's Mom: "That's good, Timmy. Now, here's the present I promised you."
Timmy: "Wow, thank you, Mom! I'm so happy!"

Mom: "Lily, could you please clean your room upstairs?"
Lily: "But I want to play!"
Mom: "It's important to keep your room tidy."
Lily: *sighs* "Okay..."
Lily: *whispers to herself as she cleans* "I don't want to do this, but I guess I have to."
Lily: *excitedly, holding her stuffed animal* "I missed you!"
Lily: *running downstairs* "Look, Mommy! I cleaned my room!"

Cat: "I say we should have fish for our picnic!"
Dog: "No, bones are the best choice!"
Mouse: "What about cheese? We can't forget cheese!"
Cat: "We're getting nowhere with this arguing. I'm hungry!"
Dog: "Me too. I don't want to fight anymore."
Mouse: "Let's just make a menu together."
Cat: "Fine, I'll bring some fish."
Dog: "And I'll bring some bones."
Mouse: "I'll make sure to bring the cheese."
Cat: "This is wonderful. We should always work together like this."
Dog: "Yeah, sharing is so much better than arguing."
Mouse: "I agree. Everyone's ideas are important."
Cat: "From now on, let's always make our menus together."
Dog: "It's settled then. Teamwork makes everything more fun!"
Mouse: "And that's how we'll always be the best of friends."

Lily: *drops calendar* Oops!
Mommy: What happened, Lily?
Lily: I dropped my calendar.
Mommy: *picks up calendar* It's a cold day today, Lily. We should wear our warm coats when we go outside.
Lily: *nods and puts on her coat*
Mommy: Let's go have some fun!
Lily: *after playing in the snow and returning inside* This hot cocoa is so good!
Mommy: Did you have fun today?
Lily: *looks at her calendar and smiles* It was a great day!

Timmy: "Wow, this spooky house is amazing!"
Skeleton: *silent and still*
Timmy: *gasps* "Ahh! A skeleton!"
Sarah: "Timmy, what's wrong?"
Timmy: "I saw a mysterious skeleton in the spooky house. It scared me!"
Sarah: "Let's go back and see if it's still there. Maybe it's not so scary after all."
Timmy: "Okay, let's check it out together."
*Timmy and Sarah return to the spooky house*
Sarah: "Look, there's the skeleton again."
Timmy: "You're right, but it doesn't seem so scary now."
Sarah: "It's just a decoration for Halloween!"
Timmy and Sarah: *laughing* "Let's keep exploring!"

Mother: "There, there, Timmy. It's nap time for you."
(Moments later)
Mother: "Time to check on my little one... Oh no, where's Timmy? He's not in his crib!"
(She searches frantically)
Mother: "Timmy? Where are you? This can't be happening!"
(She starts to cry)
Mother: "I've looked everywhere... What am I going to do?"
(Suddenly, a giggle is heard)
Mother: "What's that sound? Under the bed?"
(She looks under the bed)
Mother: "Timmy! There you are! How did you get here, you little rascal?"
Timmy: (giggles)

Mommy: "Lily, can you help me dry the dishes after dinner?"
Lily: "Of course, Mommy!"
Mommy: "Guess what, Lily? We're going to a party with all of our friends tomorrow!"
Lily: "Yay! I'm so excited!"
Mommy: "Are you ready to go, Lily?"
Lily: "Yes, Mommy! I've put on my favorite dress and I'm all ready!"
Child at the party: "Look, it's starting to rain!"
Mommy: "Oh dear, let's get inside quickly!"
Mommy: "Lily, everyone is all wet from the rain. Can you help dry off the children?"
Lily: "I'd love to help, Mommy!"
Narrator: "And so, Lily learned that it feels good to help others, even if it means getting a little wet."

Max: *Whimpers* "Where am I? I'm so scared."
Tim: "Hey there, little guy. Are you lost? Don't worry, I'll help you."
Max: *Pants and looks at Tim with hopeful eyes*
Tim: "Let's put this leash on you and take you to my place. You can rest there."
Max: *Yawns and falls asleep as soon as they reach Tim's home*
The next day...
Max's Owner: "Max! Oh, I've been so worried!"
Max: *Wags tail joyfully*
Max's Owner: "Thank you so much, Tim. You've been so kind to take care of Max."
Tim: "It was no problem at all. I'm just glad he's safe."
Max's Owner: "Come on, Max. Let's go home and remember to stay close this time."
Max: *Barks happily, staying by his owner's side*

Lily: "Look, Mommy! A bird! Can we catch it? Can we keep it?"
Mommy: "We might need a birdcage for that, sweetie. How about we plan a trip to the pet store?"
Lily: "Yes, let's go get a birdcage!"
(The next day at the pet store)
Lily: "This birdcage is beautiful! Can we get this one?"
Mommy: "Of course, we can. Let's take it home and set it up in the backyard."
(After setting up the birdcage)
Lily: "Now we just have to wait for the bird to come back."
(When the bird returns)
Lily: "There it is! I caught it, Mommy! Now we have a new pet!"
Mommy: "You'll have to take good care of your new friend."
Lily: "I will! We're going to be best friends."

Mom: "Lily, could you please send the laundry to the washing machine for me?"
Lily: "Sure, Mom! I love helping out with the laundry!"
Mom: "I'm so proud of you, Lily. You're such a great helper."
Lily: "I really enjoy doing this with you."
Mom: "The laundry is done now. Would you like to help me fold the clothes?"
Lily: "Yes, I'd be happy to!"
Mom: "Thank you, Lily. You're such a good helper."
Lily: "I'll help you with the laundry every week, Mom!"

"Lily, it's time to clean up your toys," said her mom.
"But I don't want to work!" replied Lily.
"Cleaning up is not work, it's just helping," her mom explained.
As Lily picked up her toys, a loud noise interrupted her.
Peering under the bed, she exclaimed, "A big, green monster!"
"I'm jealous of your toys. I wish I had toys to play with," the monster confessed.
"You can play with my toys!" Lily offered generously.
Soon, Lily's little brother entered the room, his eyes widening at the sight. "I want to play with those toys too!" he declared.
"Don't be jealous. You can play with us too!" the monster invited.
And with that, they all played together, their laughter filling the room.

Timmy: "Mom, Mom! I saw something scary in the sky! It looked like a missile!"
Mom: "Oh, Timmy, it's okay to feel scared. But remember, it's important to stay calm and come ask for help when you're frightened."
(Later, as it starts to rain)
Timmy: "I love the rain! I can splash and play!"
(Timmy pauses, looking at the sky)
Timmy: (to himself) "The rain is wild, just like that missile was... But I'll stay calm, just like Mom said."
Mom: (from inside) "Timmy, are you alright out there?"
Timmy: "Yes, Mom! I'm just enjoying the rain!"

Tom: "Let's go play in the park!"
Mia: "Yeah, look at that bench by the slide!"
(They run to the bench and sit on it.)
Mia: "Look, a bird!"
Tom: "Wow, it is pretty!"
(Tom gets off the bench and walks to the bird.)
Mia: "Tom, be careful!"
Tom: (whispering) "I just want to say hello."
(He reaches out to touch the bird.)
Tom: "Tweet!"
(The bird flies away.)
Mia: "Tom, you made the bird go away!"
Tom: "Sorry, Mia. I just wanted to say hello to the bird."
(He goes back to the bench.)
Mia: "It's okay, Tom. Maybe the bird will come back later."
(They sit and wait, watching other things in the park.)
Tom: "Look, there's a dog, a ball, and a flower!"
Mia: "We're having so much fun!"
Tom: "Yeah, we're happy!"

Lily: "Look at that vine, Ben! It's got so many red fruits!"
Ben: "They look delicious. Do you think we can try some?"
Lily: "Can we pick some fruits, Mom?"
Mom: "Yes, but be careful. The vine is high and the fruits are heavy. Don't drop them on your head."
Ben: "I see a really big one up there! I'm going to get it."
Lily: "Be careful, Ben!"
Ben: "Ouch!"
Lily: "Oh no, Ben! Are you okay?"
Ben: "It hurt... I was trying to get the big fruit, but it was too heavy."
Lily: "Here, Ben. Have this fruit. It is delicious. And it is not too heavy. You will feel better."
Ben: "Thank you, Lily. You are a good sister. I am sorry I dropped the fruit. I was greedy. I will share with you."
Lily: "It's okay, Ben. Let's enjoy these fruits together."
Mom: (smiling) "I'm proud of you both."

Lily: "Let's splash each other, Ben!"
Ben: (laughs) "Look, Lily, frogs and fish and ducks!"
Lily: "The pond feels so cool and clear."
Ben: "Hey, there's a big log. Do you think we can cross it?"
Lily: "Let's ask Mom if we can go to the other side!"
Mom: "Yes, you can go, but be careful."
Ben: "Take my hand, Lily. We need to balance on this slippery log."
Lily: "Look, more frogs and fish and ducks! This is fun!"
Ben: "Did you hear that loud roar?"
Lily: "It's a big bear! It looks hungry and angry!"
Ben: "We need to run back across the log!"
Lily: "Oh no, we slipped into the water!"
Ben: "The bear is coming after us!"
Dad: (with a roar) "Stay away from my kids!"
Lily: "Dad's here with a big stick!"
Ben: "He scared the bear away!"
Dad: "I've got you both. You're safe now. I'm so proud of you. You are brave and smart, and I love you."
Mom: "Oh, my little ones, you're wet and cold. Let's get you wrapped in a towel. You need a warm bath and some hot soup. I love you."
Lily: "We had such an adventure today. We saw so many animals and crossed the log."
Ben: "And we met a bear! But Dad came just in time."
Mom: "Now, eat up your soup and drink your milk. It's time for bed."
Lily: "I'm going to dream about the pond."
Ben: "Me too. I'm happy."

"Tommy, you need to take this medicine every day. It will help you feel better," the doctor said.
"OK, doctor. Thank you," Tommy replied.
"Good boy, Tommy. Now, follow the nurse. She will lead you to the exit," the doctor encouraged, handing him a sticker.
"Bye, Tommy. I hope you get well soon," the nurse said as she held his hand and walked him to the door.
"Bye, nurse. You are good," Tommy said with a small smile, feeling a bit braver with his new lion sticker.

Sara: "You all have such beautiful hair, don't you? Long, short, curly, straight. Let's make you all look pretty today."
Sara: "What a lovely day! How about we go outside, hmm? You'll love the garden."
Sara: "Right under this tree is perfect. Now, let's spread this blanket and get you all settled."
Sara: "There, now let's comb your hair. You're going to look even more beautiful."
Sara: (startled) "What's that noise?"
Sara: "No, no, big dog! Stay away! We're just playing!"
Sara: (frantically) "Hey! Drop my doll! Don't shake her like that! You're getting her all wet!"
Sara: (crying) "Please give her back to me. You're too fast... and strong."
Sara: (sobbing) "Oh, my dolls, I'm so sorry. I hope she's okay. Her hair... it can't be ruined."
Sara: (wistfully) "I wish that dog would come back, apologize, and bring my doll back all dry and happy again."

Ben: "Look, I drew a cow, a pig, a sheep, and a hen!"
Miss Lee: "Very good, Ben! You are a great artist. Do you know what sound each animal makes?"
Ben: "Moo, oink, baa, cluck!"
Miss Lee: "That's right, Ben! You are very smart. Now, can you draw a little duck to complete the farm?"
Ben: "Quack, quack! Here's the little duck."
Miss Lee: "You did it, Ben! You completed the farm. The little duck is very cute. I'm so proud of you!"
Ben: "I like drawing with you. I can't wait to draw more!"

Lily: "I love playing with my big doll, it's my favorite!"
Ben: "It's a nice doll, but check out my car with noises and lights!"
Lily's mom: "Eat well, children. Rice is good for you."
Ben: *looks at the doll* "Can I have your doll, Lily?"
Lily: "No, Ben. This is my doll. You have your car."
Ben: *feeling jealous* "But I want to play with your doll!"
Lily: *holding the doll tightly* "No, it's mine!"
Lily's mom: *entering the kitchen* "Stop it, both of you. Fighting is not nice. You should share your toys and be kind to each other."
Lily and Ben: "We're sorry, mom. We won't fight again."
Lily's mom: "That's good. Now finish your rice and then you can play nicely. And remember, the doll and the car are both special. You can take turns and enjoy them together."
Lily and Ben: *nodding* "Okay, mom."
*After eating*
Lily: "Let's play with the doll and the car together!"
Ben: "Yeah, let's have fun and not be jealous anymore."

Lily: "Hello, doggy! What is your name?"

Dog: *Barks happily*
Lily and Max: *Hug and kiss the dog*

Tom: "Hi, I am Tom. Do you want to play with me and my bone?"
New Dog: "No, thank you. Your bone is old and dirty. And you are small and ordinary. I only play with dogs who have new and shiny bones. And who are big and special. Go away, Tom. You are boring."
Tom: (to himself) "I don't understand why she's so mean. I like my bone, and I think I'm a good dog. I don't want to go away. I want to play and have fun."
New Dog: (ignoring Tom and walking away)
Tom: (to himself) "She's not a nice dog. I don't want to be friends with her anymore. My bone is the best bone ever, and I am a good dog. I hope to find other dogs who are kind and friendly and who like to play with me and my bone."

Mia: "I love peanuts, they're so crunchy and salty!"
Leo: "I see you have a peanut there. Can I have it?"
Mia: "No, it is mine. You have a cracker. Eat your cracker."
Leo: "But I really want a peanut. Please, Mia, give me your peanut."
Mia: "No, no, no. Go away, Leo. Leave me alone."
(Leo is sad and angry, runs away and cries.)
Mia: "Leo, Leo, wait. I am sorry. I was mean. You can have my peanut. Here, take it."
Leo: "Thank you, Mia. You are a good friend. I am sorry, too. I was jealous. Can we share the peanut?"
Mia: "Yes, we can share the peanut. And we can share the cracker, too. And we can play with toys and eat snacks. We are friends, Leo."
(Leo and Mia hug, share the peanut and the cracker, play with toys, and eat snacks.)

Tom: "Look at all the big trains and cars, Lily! And listen to all the noise!"
Lily: "I love the colors too, Tom! And look, what's this on the ground? A can!"
Tom: "And I've found some coins and papers. Let's lift them and look at them."
Lily: "Hey, what's that over there? A big brown box with a red sign. It looks like a flower!"
Tom: "I wonder what's inside. Let's go see!"
Lily: "It's heavy, help me lift it, Tom."
Tom: "Be careful with that wire—"
[Sudden loud beep followed by an explosion]
Bystander 1: "Oh no, the box, it was a bomb!"
Bystander 2: "There's fire and smoke everywhere! And the poor kids, Tom and Lily..."
Bystander 3: "They're gone... This is terrible. They shouldn't have touched that box."
Bystander 4: "It had a warning sign. They didn't understand. They should have been more careful."
Bystander 5: "We must teach children to not touch unknown things. They can be dangerous."
Bystander 6: "Listen to the signs and to those who know better. We have to keep our kids safe."

Jill: "I love to skip! It's so much fun!"
Jill: "Hello, horse. Do you want to skip with me?"
Horse: "No, thank you. I do not skip. I run. Skipping is for little girls, not for big horses."
Jill: "But skipping is fun. You should try it. It will make you happy."
Horse: "No, I do not need to try it. I know what I like. I like to run. Running is fun. It makes me happy."
Jill: "Please, horse. Just try it once. Maybe you will like it. Please, please, please."
Horse: "Fine. I will try it once. But only once. And then you will leave me alone."
Jill: "Thank you, horse. You are nice. Come on, let's skip."
Horse: "Ow, ow, ow. This is not fun. This is bad. I do not like skipping. I like running. Why did you make me skip?"
Jill: "I am sorry, horse. I did not mean to make you fall. I just wanted to share my fun with you. I thought you would like skipping too. But I see now that you have your own fun. And that is okay. We can have different fun. We can still be friends."
Horse: "It is okay, Jill. I am sorry too. I was not nice to you. I should have been more polite. I see now that you have your own fun too. And that is okay. We can have different fun. We can still be friends."
Jill and the Horse: "We are sorry. We are friends. We are nice."
Farmer: "Hello, Jill. Hello, horse. Are you hungry? Do you want some oats?"
Jill and the Horse: "Yes, please. We are hungry. We want some oats."

Anna: "Mine!"
Ben: "No, mine!"
Mom: "Stop it, you two! Why are you fighting over a toy? You have so many toys. Can't you be nice to each other?"
Anna: "Sorry, Mom."
Ben: "Sorry, Mom."
Mom: "That's better. Now you are being good twins. I love you both very much."
Anna and Ben: "We love you too, Mom."

Tom: "Look, Mia, a fish!"
Mia: "Let's dive and catch it!"
Tom: "Okay, but be careful!"
Mia: "Where is the fish?"
Tom: "I don't know, Tom. Maybe it is hiding."
Mia: "Let's go back to the poolside, Tom. Maybe we can find another fish."
Tom: "Or maybe we can have a snack, Tom. I have a will in my bag. Do you want some?"
Mia: "A will? What is a will, Mia?"
Tom: "A will is a fruit, Tom. It is round and green and sweet. My mom gave it to me. It is good for you."
Mia: "Thank you, Mia. It looks yummy."
Tom: "You're welcome, Tom. It is yummy."

Tim: "Can we go, Mom?"
Mom: "OK, but be careful and stay close to me."
Mia: "Wow, look at the leopard! He is so pretty!"
Leopard: "Roar!"
Mia: "Help!"
Tim: "Help! The leopard is angry and wants to hurt Mia!"
Man: "Sorry, kids. The leopard is not used to people. He is not a pet. He is a wild animal. You should not go near him or touch him. He can be dangerous."
Mom: "Thank you, sir. We are sorry. We did not know. We will not do it again."
Man: *smiles and nods, then gives them stickers*
Mom: *hugs Mia and Tim*

Tom: "Oh no, my blue car's wheel is broken!"
Lily: "Don't worry, Tom. I can repair your car. I have a stamp that can fix it."
Tom: "Really?"
Lily: "Yes, this is a magic stamp. It can make anything better. Watch this. Abracadabra!"
Tom: "Wow, Lily, you are right. Your stamp is magic. Thank you for repairing my car. You are a good friend."
Lily: "You are welcome, Tom. I am glad you like my stamp. It is very reliable. It always works. Do you want to play with me?"
Tom: "Yes, I do. Let's race our cars again. But be careful, don't crash them."
(They play with their cars.)
Lily: "Let's use the stamp to decorate our cars with stars!"
Tom: "That's a great idea!"
(They decorate their cars and continue playing.)
Tom: "I'm so happy we didn't crash them again."
Lily: "Me too. We are good friends."

Lily: "I'm so hungry. Can we open the fridge?"
Ben: "Yes, we can. But we need to ask Mom first."
Lily: "Mom, can we have a snack?"
Mom: "Sure, my loves. What do you want?"
Lily: "We want to open the fridge and see what's inside."
Mom: "Okay, but be careful. And don't make a mess."
Lily: "Can you help me, Ben? I can't reach the crackers."
Ben: "Of course, Lily. I'll help you."
Lily: "Thank you for helping me, Ben."
Ben: "You're welcome, Lily. You're my best sister."

Lily: "One, two, three... ten! Ready or not, here I come!"
Lily: "Hmm, that big tree with the hole looks like a good hiding spot. Ben might be in there."
Lily: *running to the tree* "Ben, are you in here?"
Ben: *from inside the hole* "Boo!"
Lily: *screams* "Ben, you scared me! Why did you hide in the dark hole?"
Ben: *emerging with a flashlight and laughing* "I wanted to find a good hiding spot. The dark hole was perfect. No one can see me there."
Lily: "But it is not fun to hide in the dark. It is scary and cold. And you can't see anything."
Ben: "I don't mind the dark. I have my flashlight. And I can see you when you come close."
Lily: "I don't like the dark. It makes me feel alone and sad. And I can't see your face."
Ben: *looking concerned* "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to make you feel bad. Do you want me to explain why I like the dark?"
Lily: "Yes, please. Explain to me why you like the dark."
Ben: *taking Lily's hand* "Come, I'll show you."
Ben: *turning on his flashlight inside the hole* "Look, the dark is not so bad. It is like a secret place where you can imagine anything. You can pretend you are in a cave, or a spaceship, or a castle. You can make up stories and have fun."
Lily: *looking inside with the flashlight* "I see. The dark is like a game. You can use your flashlight to make shapes and shadows."
Ben: "Yes, exactly. The dark is like a game. And you can play with me. We can be friends in the dark."
Lily: "OK, Ben. I'll try to play with you in the dark. But can we also play in the light sometimes?"
Ben: "Of course, Lily. We can play in the light too. We can play hide and seek anywhere. As long as we are together."
Lily: "Thank you, Ben. You are a good friend. You explained to me why you like the dark. And you made me feel better."
Ben: "You're welcome, Lily. You are a good friend too. You listened to me and you gave me a chance. And you made me happy."
Both: "Let's play again!"
*They run out of the hole and look for a new hiding spot, playing until it's time to go home.*

Anna: "Look at me, Mommy! Look at me, Daddy! I'm a dancer!"
Boy: "Ha ha, you're not a dancer, you're a wet rat!"
Anna's Mom: "Hey, stop that! That's not nice!"
Anna's Dad: "Apologize to Anna right now. You don't pour water on people. That's rude and mean."
Boy: "Sorry."
Anna's Mom: "It's okay, you're still a dancer and a princess."
Anna: "Thank you. Do you want to dance with me?"
Boy: "Yes."
(Anna's mom and dad watch them and smile.)

Sam: "Lily, do you want to build a tower with me?"
Lily: "Yes, Sam, that sounds fun. How high do you want to make it?"
Sam: "Very high, like the sky. We need a lot of blocks. Can we use some of your blocks too?"
Lily: "Sure, Sam, we can use some of my blocks. But we have to be organized. We have to sort the blocks by color and size. That way, we can find the ones we need."
Sam: "Look, Lily, I have a big red block. This can be the base of the tower."
Lily: "Good idea, Sam. I have a medium blue block. This can go on top of the red block."
Lily: "Wow, Sam, we did it! We made the highest tower ever!"
Sam: "Yes, Lily, we did it! We are the best builders!"
They hugged each other and smiled.

Lily: "I love drawing with my crayons."
Max: "I want to play with these!"
Lily: "No, Max, those are my crayons. Give them back to me. You have your own toys to play with."
Max: (laughing) "Too bad, Lily. I like to play with your crayons. They are fun to break and throw. You can't have them back."
Lily: (crying) "Max, please, open the door. You are ruining my crayons. I need them to draw. They are my supply of colors."
Mom: "Max, that is not nice. You have to share with your sister. You have to respect her things. You have to apologize and give her back her crayons."
Mom: "Max, look what you did. You wasted Lily's crayons. You have to clean this up and buy her new ones with your allowance. You also have to say sorry to Lily and hug her."
Max: "I'm sorry, Lily. I was mean to you. I should not have taken your crayons. I should have asked you first. I will buy you new ones and help you draw. Can you forgive me?"
Lily: "I forgive you, Max. Thank you for saying sorry. I love you, brother. Can we play together?"
Max: "I love you, too, sister. Yes, we can play together. But first, let's clean this up and put the crayons back on your desk."
Mom: "That's good, kids. You learned how to solve your problem and be kind to each other. Now, let's go and have some cookies and milk."

Lily: "Ben, isn't it fun to play here on the farm?"
Ben: "Yeah, Lily! I love seeing all the animals. Look at the cows, pigs, sheep, and chickens!"
Lily: "I have an idea! Let's feed the chickens today."
Ben: "Great idea! Let's ask the farmer for some corn."
Lily: "Excuse me, Mr. Farmer, could we have some corn to feed the chickens?"
Farmer: "Of course, here's a bucket of corn. Be careful with the chickens. They are healthy and strong. They can peck you if you are not nice to them."
Ben: "Thank you, Mr. Farmer!"
Lily: (holding the bucket) "Look at all these chickens, Ben! White, brown, and black ones!"
Ben: "They sure are noisy and busy. Look at them cluck and flap their wings."
Lily: (waving to the chickens) "Hello, chickens! We have some corn for you. Do you want some?"
Ben: (throwing corn on the ground) "Here you go, chickens!"
Lily: "They seem to love it! Look at them peck and scratch and eat."
Ben: "They're happy and full now."
Lily: (smiling) "You are good chickens. You give us eggs and meat. You are healthy and strong. We like you."
Ben: "Bye, chickens! See you next time!"
Lily: (to the farmer) "We had fun with the chickens. They are nice to us."
Farmer: "You are welcome. You are good kids. You are nice to the chickens."

Lily: "Hello, dog! Do you want to play with us?"
Ben: "Lily, be careful! We don't know the dog. It might bite us."
Lily: "See, Ben? The dog is helpful. It likes us. It is our friend."
Ben: (shaking his head) "I don't trust it. I think it's greedy. I want to go home."
Lily: (after playing with the dog) "Isn't this fun?"
Ben: (from behind the tree, feeling lonely and sad) "..."
Lily: "Help! Help! The dog is hurting me!"
Ben: (running to help Lily) "Let go of her!"
Dog Owner: (shouting at the dog) "Bad dog! Get over here!"
Dog Owner: (to Lily and Ben) "I'm sorry. You shouldn't play with strange dogs. You need to be careful."
Lily and Ben: (hurt and scared) "We're sorry. We've learned our lesson."

Sara: "Hello, bear. Do you want to go on the slide?"
Bear: "Yes, Sara. I like the slide. It is fast and fun."
Bear: "Whee! That was fun. Thank you, Sara."
Sara: "I am sleepy, bear. Let's go home."
Bear: "Me too, Sara. Let's go home and take a nap."
Sara's mom: "Hello, Sara. Hello, bear. Did you have fun at the park?"
Sara: "Yes, mom. We had fun. But we are sleepy now. Can we take a nap?"
Sara's mom: "Of course, Sara. You can take a nap. But first, you need to wash your hands and face. You are dirty and smelly from playing."
Sara: "Okay, mom. I will wash my hands and face. But what about the bear? He is dirty and smelly too."
Sara's mom: "Don't worry, Sara. I will wash the bear for you. He needs a bath too. Then he will be clean and soft again."
Sara's mom: "Here you go, Sara. Your bear is clean and soft now. He smells good too."
Sara: "Thank you, mom. You are the best. I love you and I love the bear."
Sara's mom: "I love you too, Sara. And I love the bear too. Now, let's go to your bed and take a nap. You need to rest after playing so much."
Sara and the bear: "Okay, mom. Let's go to bed and take a nap."

Lily: (singing joyfully) "La la la, flowers and stars!"
Lily: (singing to her toys) "Twinkle, twinkle, little star..."
Lily: (singing softly before bed) "Hush, little animals, don't you cry..."
Lily: (in her dream, with wonder) "What's that light? And that sound?"
Angel: (smiling) "Hello, little singer. I like your songs. Do you want to sing with me?"
Lily: (nodding) "Yes, please. What is your name? Where do you come from?"
Angel: "My name is Joy. I come from heaven. Heaven is a place where God and his friends live. We sing praises to God and thank him for his love. Do you know God?"
Lily: "Yes, I know God. He made me and he loves me. He gave me my family and my friends. He gave me my voice and my songs. I want to thank him too. Can you teach me a song?"
Angel: "Of course. Listen to me and repeat after me."
Angel: (singing a simple, beautiful song)
Lily: (repeating after the angel, then together) "Thank you, God, for your love..."
Lily: (feeling warm and peaceful) "This is the best dream ever."

Lila: "Look at us, playing in the park with our toys! I love my doll."
Ben: "And my car is awesome! Here, have some of my snacks."
Lila: "Ben, do you see that? A big orange cat over there on the bench!"
Ben: "Yeah, it's licking its paw. Let's go pet it."
Cat: "Meow."
Lila: "Hello, cat. You are very pretty. Can we pet you?"
Ben: "Be careful, Lila. The cat does not like us. It might scratch us."
Lila: "It's okay, I'll just— Ow!"
Ben: "I told you to be careful. Here, let me help you with that." *wraps Lila's hand with a tissue*
Lila: "Thank you, Ben. I'm sorry I didn't listen."
Ben: "It's alright. Let's leave the cat alone and go back to our toys."
Lila: "Yes, let's play some more. I'm happy."

Lily: "I'm hungry, Tom. I want to eat soup for lunch."
Tom: "Me too, Lily. Let's ask Mom to make some."
Mom: "I'll make soup for you both. Let's go to the kitchen."
Lily: "Look at that big, shiny spoon on the counter. It's so shiny! Can I have the spoon, Mom?"
Mom: "No, Lily, that spoon is for the soup. You can have another spoon to play with."
Lily: *whispers to herself* "I really want that shiny spoon..." *she quietly takes the spoon and runs away*
Tom: "Lily, give back the spoon! Mom needs it for the soup!"
Lily: *hiding under the bed* "But I like this shiny spoon..."
Tom: "Lily, please give back the spoon. The soup will be ready soon. We can share the soup and eat it with our own spoons."
Lily: "Okay, Tom, I will give back the spoon. I'm sorry I took it. I just liked the shiny spoon."
Tom: "Thank you, Lily." *takes the spoon back to Mom*
Mom: "Thank you, Tom. Now let's finish the soup." *stirs soup* "Soup is ready, Lily and Tom! Come and eat!"
Lily: "This soup is delicious!"
Tom: "Yeah, I'm not hungry anymore. We're happy."
Lily: "I like soup."
Tom: "I like Mom."
Lily: "I like you, Tom. We learned to share and to say sorry today."
Tom: "And we learned to listen and to shine, just like the spoon."

Lily: "Look at this shiny stone I found!"
Ben: "Can I see it?"
Lily: "No, it is mine!"
Ben: "Please, just for a moment."
Lily: "No!" *holds her pocket tight*
Ben: *sadly* "But I just want to look at it."
Lily: *screams* "Don't touch it!"
Ben: *cries* "Ow, my knee!"
Lily: *feeling bad* "Oh no, Ben, I'm sorry. Here, you can have it."
Ben: "Thank you, Lily." *smiles and wipes tears*
Both: "Sorry!" *they hug*
Lily: "Let's share it and play together."
Ben: "Yes, let's do that!" *they play happily*

Lily: "Look, I found a star! It's shiny and yellow. I am a princess. This is my crown."
Ben: "Give me the star. It is mine."
Lily: "No, it is mine. I found it first."
Ben: "But I want it too!"
Lily: "Stop pulling it!"
Ben: "You stop!"
Mom: "What's all this noise about? Stop fighting. The star is for sharing. You can both play with it. Or you can play with something else. But you have to be nice to each other."
Ben: "Sorry, Mom."
Lily: "Sorry, Mom. Sorry, Ben."
Ben: "Sorry, Lily."
Mom: "It's okay. I love you both. Now, let's play together."
Lily: "Your turn to wear the star, Ben."
Ben: "Thanks, Lily! Now you're the princess, and I'm the knight."
Lily: "We're friends again!"

Ben: "Would you like some more tea, Mia?"
Mia: "Yes, please, Ben. You are a good server."
(They sip their pretend tea and chat.)
Ben: "I love talking about our toys."
Mia: "And our pets are so cute!"
(Suddenly, a noise is heard.)
Mailman: "Hello, Ben and Mia. I have some mail for you."
Ben and Mia: "Mail for us? Wow!"
(They run to the gate.)
Mailman: "These are from your grandma and grandpa."
Ben: "Who are they from?"
Mailman: "They live far away, but they love you very much. They wrote you some letters and sent you some pictures."
Mia: "Thank you, mailman. You are very nice."
Mailman: "You're welcome, kids. Have fun reading your mail. And be careful with the scissors."
(Back at the table, they open their envelopes.)
Ben: "Grandma and grandpa are very funny."
Mia: "They are also very serious. They say we have to be good and listen to our mom and dad."
Ben and Mia: "We will, grandma and grandpa. We love you too."
(They finish their tea party and hug each other.)
Ben: "We are happy."
Mia: "We have mail."

Ben: "Look, Anna, I made a big tower! It is very high and strong!"
Anna: "Can I have some of your blocks, Ben? I need more to make my tower."
Ben: "No, Anna, these are my blocks. You have your own blocks. Go away!"
Anna: *Pushes the tower* 
Ben: "Anna, why did you do that? You broke my tower! You are a bad sister!"
Anna: "I'm sorry, Ben, I'm sorry! I did not mean to break your tower. I was mad at you, but I should not have pushed your blocks. Can you forgive me?"
Ben: "It's okay, Anna, I forgive you. But don't do that again, okay? It is not nice to break other people's things."
Anna: "Okay, Ben, I won't do that again. I love you, brother."
*They hug and make up, then play together.*

Ben: "Look at me, I'm a mighty lion!"
Lily: "I'm a mighty princess!"
Mom: "What are you two doing? Stop jumping and clean up this mess!"
Ben: "But mom, we're having fun!"
Lily: "Yeah, mom, please let us play a little more!"
Mom: "No, you have to eat and then take a nap. You're making too much noise and you're ruining the cushions. They're not for jumping, they're for sleeping. Now come on, or you'll be in trouble."
Ben: (sadly) "She's mean and unfair."
Lily: (whining) "I don't want to eat or nap. I want to play."
(Note on the wall): "I'm a mighty lion too. And I don't like noisy kids. Next time, be quiet and listen to your mom. Or I'll come back and eat you. Grrr!"
Ben: (crying) "Oh no, what happened here?"
Lily: (scared) "Our toys and books are broken and dirty!"
Ben: "Fluffy did this... We should have listened to Mom."
Lily: "I'm so sorry!"
Ben: "Me too. Let's clean up and promise to be good and quiet from now on."
Lily: "I hope Mom forgives us."
Ben: "And I hope Fluffy doesn't come back to eat us."
Lily: "We need to find a new game that's fun and safe."

Lily: "Look at that big green apple on the tree! I want to eat it."
Ben: "Give me the apple, Lily. I want to play with it."
Lily: "No, Ben. It is my apple. I want to eat it. It is yummy."
Ben: "But I want to play with it!"
Lily: "Oh no! We destroyed the apple!"
Ben: "Look, Lily. The bird and the squirrel are happy. They like the apple."
Lily: "Maybe they are hungry. Maybe we can share with them."
Ben: "Let's find more apples to share."

Ben: "Look, I have a big red marble. It is mighty. It can knock down all your marbles."
Lily: "That is not nice, Ben. You should share your marbles and play fair."
Ben: "I don't want to share. I want to win. My red marble is the best."
Lily: "Hey, what did you do? You broke my red marble. That is not fair."
Ben: "I poked it. You said it was mighty, but it was not. It was fragile. You should not be mean and boastful. You should be kind and humble."
Ben: "I'm sorry, Lily. Can we be friends?"
Lily: "Yes, we can be friends."
(They hug and share their marbles.)

Lily: "Tom, get the eggs. Tom, get the flour. Tom, get the milk. Tom, get the sugar. Tom, get the bowl. Tom, get the spoon. Tom, get the pan. Tom, hurry up!"
Tom: "Lily, I don't want to cook. I want to play with my cars. You are too bossy. You do everything yourself."
Lily: "Tom, you are silly. Cooking is fun. Cars are boring. You have to help me. We are a team. Mom will be happy if we cook a cake for her."
Mom: "Lily and Tom, what are you doing? Why are you making such a noise? Why are you making such a mess? You are not cooking. You are fighting. You are not a team. You are naughty."
Tom: "Sorry, Mom."
Lily: "We're sorry. We love you."
Mom: "I love you too. We can cook a cake together another day. You have to be nice to each other, share, take turns, and have fun."

Ben: "Let's go, Lily! Maybe we can find a treasure or a secret cave!"
Lily: "OK, Ben! But be careful. It looks dark and spooky over there."
Ben: "Wow, look at the wind, Lily! It's so strong and fast!"
Lily: "Ben, I don't like the wind. Can we go back, please?"
Ben: "OK, Lily. We can go back. But first, let's do something fun. Let's make a kite!"
Ben: "Here, Lily. This is a kite. You can hold it and let the wind lift it up. It will fly like a bird!"
Lily: "Thank you, Ben. How do I make it fly?"
Lily: "You are the best, Ben. You made me discover something new and fun. I love you."
Ben: "I love you too, Lily. You are the best, too. You made me discover something new and sweet."

Tom: "Look at this razor. It's so shiny, just like a toy!"
Tom: "I'll just wait for Dad to leave for work... Then I'll make it sparkle even more!"
Tom (to himself in the mirror): "Wow, what's this? A big mirror! I wonder what I'd look like with the razor on my face, like Dad."
Tom (whispering): "Here goes... I'll just touch it to my cheek."
Tom (crying out): "Ouch! It's not a toy, it hurts!"
Mom (alarmed): "Tom, what happened? Show me where it hurts!"
Tom (crying): "I cut my face with the razor, Mommy. It stings!"
Mom (hugging him): "Oh, my dear! Let's get you cleaned up. You must never touch the razor again. It's very dangerous and not for children."
Tom (apologetically): "I'm sorry, Mom. I won't polish or touch it ever again."
Mom: "Promise me, Tom."
Tom (to his dad): "I'm sorry, Dad. I learned my lesson."
Tom (playing with his toys): "I don't need the razor to be like Dad. I've got my cars, blocks, and teddy bear. And Dad loves me, even with a band-aid on my face."

Tim: "Let's eat some prunes!"
Sue: "OK!"
Tim: "Yuck! These prunes are stupid!"
Sue: "Yuck! They are bad!"
Tim: "Let's eat some cake!"
Sue: "OK!"
Tim: "Mmm! This cake is good!"
Sue: "Mmm! It is nice!"

Anna: *signs* "Can I go on the slide, please?"
Daddy: *smiles and signs* "Yes, you can. Be careful and have fun."
Anna: *signs to the boy* "Hello, I am Anna. What is your name?"
Boy: *frowns and speaks* "Go away, you are weird. You can't talk."
Anna: *runs to her daddy and signs* "Daddy, the boy was mean to me. He did not sign. He did not like me."
Daddy: *hugs Anna, kisses her head, and signs* "I am sorry, Anna. The boy was ignorant. He did not know how to sign. He did not know how to be kind. You are not weird. You are wonderful. You can talk. You can sign. You are my smart and brave girl. I love you."

Lily: "Hello, Mr. Bear! Are you ready to drive the car today?"
Bear: "Yes, Lily! Let's go on an adventure!"
Lily: "Oh, what's this? A fly on our cushion!"
Lily: "Are you okay, little fly?"
Lily: "Oh no, you're not moving... I think you're thirsty. I'll get you some water!"
Lily: "Here you go, little fly. Drink up!"
Lily: "Why aren't you waking up?"
Lily: "I know! You need a blanket to rest. Good night, fly. I hope you have good dreams."
Lily: "And thank you, doll, for being my friend. You are alive and happy."
Mom: "What are you doing, Lily?"
Lily: "I am playing with my toys, mom. And I am saying thank you to them. They are good toys. They make me happy."
Mom: "That's very nice of you, Lily. It's good to say thank you to the things and people that make you happy. And it's good to be kind to the things and people that are not happy. Like the fly. You tried to help the fly, didn't you?"
Lily: "Yes, mom. But the fly was dead. I could not make it alive. I was sad."
Mom: "I know, Lily. Sometimes things die and we can't do anything about it. It's okay to be sad. But it's also okay to be happy. Because you have a lot of things and people that love you. Like me. And dad. And your toys. And the cushion. And the sun. And the moon. And the stars. And many more. Can you say thank you to them, too?"
Lily: "Yes, mom. Thank you, mom. Thank you, dad. Thank you, toys. Thank you, cushion. Thank you, sun. Thank you, moon. Thank you, stars. Thank you, thank you, thank you."

Ben: "That was fun! Come on, Lily!"
Lily: "My name is Lily. What is your name?"
Max: "Hey, you have weird skin. What is your name?"
Max: "My name is Max. And I have the best skin. It is red and green, like a firework. You have boring skin. It is white, like snow. I am envious of nothing."
Ben: "You are wrong, Max. Lily's skin is not boring. It is beautiful, like a flower. And my skin is not weird. It is cool, like chocolate. We have different skin, but we are both good. You are envious of everything."
(Ben and Lily slide down together and hug.)
(The moms clap.)

Lily: "I am a queen. You have to do what I say."
Tom: "I am a teacher. You have to learn what I teach."
Mom: "Lily, Tom, dinner time!"
Lily: "This is my hat. I want to wear it for dinner."
Tom: "No, you have to put it back. It is not yours. It is mom's hat. She will be mad if you take it."
Lily: "Give it here, it's mine!"
Tom: "Let go, Lily! You'll break it!"
*The sound of a crash*
Mom: "What happened here? Why did you make such a mess? Why did you fight over the hat?"
Lily and Tom: "We are sorry, mom. We were playing dress-up and we did not want to end. We both liked the hat and we did not share. We did not mean to break the lamp."
Mom: "I understand you were having fun, but you have to be careful and respectful. The hat is mine and you have to ask me before you use it. The lamp is ours and you have to be gentle with it. The clothes are yours and you have to put them away. Now, help me clean up this mess and then we can go for dinner. And no more fighting, okay?"
Lily and Tom: "Okay, mom. We are sorry. We will help you. We will not fight."
*Sounds of cleaning*
Lily and Tom: "We love you, mom. You are the best."
Mom: "I love you too, Lily and Tom. You are the best too. Now, let's go and eat. I made your favorite soup."
*Later that evening*
Mom: "Good night, my loves."
Lily and Tom: "Good night, mom."

Sara: "I'm so excited, Ben! We're going on a holiday with Mum and Dad!"
Ben: "Me too, Sara! Look, I've packed all my toys and clothes."
Mum: "Alright, kids, let's head to the airport. It's time to fly!"
Dad: "Now, let's weigh these bags. Hmm, looks like we'll have to pay extra for the luggage."
Sara: "Our bags are small and light, right, Ben? We don't have to weigh them!"
Ben: "Yeah! Let's go to the plane!"
Sara: "Wow, this plane is huge and so loud!"
Ben: "Look out the window, Sara! There are clouds and birds!"
Sara: "This is fun! Want to share some snacks and play games?"
Ben: "Yes! I'm so excited!"
Sara: "Oh no, what's happening? The plane is shaking!"
Ben: "I'm scared, Sara!"
Mum: "Hold our hands, kids. It's okay, it's just a little turbulence."
Dad: "We'll be landing soon. Don't worry."
Sara: "Brrr, it's so cold and white here!"
Ben: "Look at all the snow and ice! Good thing we have our warm coats and hats."
Mum: "Let's get off the plane quickly and into the car. It's chilly!"
Dad: "Here we are, a nice house with a warm fire and a beautifully decorated tree."
Sara: "This place is beautiful! I'm happy again."
Ben: "Me too, Sara. This is going to be a wonderful holiday."

Ben: "Sam, isn't it great playing here in the cabin with all these toys and books?"
Sam: "Yeah, Ben! I love it here, even if it's old and small."
Ben: "Did you hear that loud noise?"
Sam: "Let's look out the window!"
Ben: "Wow, a big, red, shiny truck! And there's a bald man driving it."
Bald Man: *knocks on the door* "Hello, boys. I'm sorry to delay your play, but I need to talk to your dad. He asked me to fix the roof of the cabin. It has a hole and it leaks when it rains."
Sam: "Can we see the hole and the roof?"
Ben: "Yeah, can we help you?"
Bald Man: "Sure, you can help me. But you have to be careful. The roof is high and steep. You have to wear these helmets and gloves. And you have to listen to me and do what I say."
Ben and Sam: *nodding* "We will!"
Bald Man: "Follow me to the ladder. Look, there's the hole. It's big and dark. I'll show you how to fix it with some wood and tar."
Ben: "We can hold the wood and nails."
Sam: "And we can spread the tar and hammer the nails!"
Bald Man: "Good job, boys. You are very brave and smart. You helped me a lot. Now the roof is good and strong. It won't leak anymore."
Ben: "We did it, Sam! I'm so proud."
Sam: "Me too! Let's thank the bald man."
Ben and Sam: "Thank you!"
Ben: "Let's go tell dad what we did!"
Dad: "I'm so proud of you both! Here, have some cookies and milk as a reward."
Ben: "Yum, these cookies are great!"
Sam: "And the milk is so refreshing!"
Ben: "Now let's go back to playing with the toys and books."
Sam: "We're going to have even more fun now!"

Tom: "Hey Mia, look what I brought to play with!"
Mia: "Wow, a magnet! Let's see what it sticks to!"
Tom: "It's sticking to your fridge!"
Mia: "And my spoon... and the car... and the bell!"
Both: *Laughing*
Mia's Mom: "Welcome, Tom. I'm glad you came to play."
Tom: *Yawning* "I'm getting sleepy."
Mia: *Rubbing eyes* "Me too. I could use a nap."
Mia's Mom: "You can sleep in Mia's room. She has a cozy bed and a soft pillow."
Tom: "Let's take the magnet with us."
Mia: "Good idea. We'll put it here on the nightstand."
Both: *Cuddling under the blanket* "Night!"
Mia: "Can't wait to find more things to stick the magnet to tomorrow."
Tom: "Me too. Goodnight, Mia."
Mia: "Goodnight, Tom."

Lila: "I love playing with my big doll!"
Tom: "And I love my small car!"
Lila: "Look, we can share and play together!"
Tom: "Yeah, this is fun!"
Lila: (screaming) "No, no, that is mine! Give it back!"
Tom: (yelling while throwing a stick) "Hey, leave her doll alone!"
Lila: (crying) "The dog... it took my doll!"
Tom: "Come on, let's chase after it!"
Lila: (knocking on the door) "Excuse me, that dog has my doll!"
Lady: (opening the door) "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, this is my dog. He is naughty and likes to carry things. He did not mean to hurt you. Here, take your doll back. And here, have a cookie. I'm very sorry."
Lila: "Thank you for the doll and the cookie."
Tom: "Yes, thank you."
Lila: "Let's go back to the garden and be more careful with our toys."
Tom: "And remember to forgive, just like the lady and her dog."
Lila: "Yes, forgiveness is important."

Tom: "Ah, this crown and throne do make me feel important and proud."
Tom: "Today, I shall dazzle the other kings and queens at the party with my splendid crown!"
Tom (crying out): "Help! Help! Where is my crown?"
Girl: "Here is your crown, sir. Are you okay?"
Tom: "Thank you, but my crown is ruined. It is not shiny and pretty anymore. The other kings and queens will laugh at me. I don't want to go to the party anymore."
Girl: "Don't be sad, sir. Your crown is not the most important thing. You are still a king. You have a big heart and a kind voice. You can make people happy and help them. That is what makes you a good king. The other kings and queens will like you for who you are, not for what you wear."
Tom (smiling): "Thank you for your kindness. I see now that you are right."
Tom (at the party): "I am happy and proud to be here among friends, and I shall always strive to be a good king."

Sara: "Let's race to the swing, Tom!"
Tom: "Last one there is a rotten egg!"
Sara: "Look, I can hang from the swing!"
Tom: "Wow, you are brave!" *claps hands*
Sara: "Hello, bird! Do you want to play with us?"
Bird: *lands on Sara's shoulder and pecks her ear gently* "Hi, Sara! You are kind. I like you."
Sara: "What is your name?"
Bird: "My name is Spirit. I am a magic bird. I can talk to children who are kind and have fun."
Tom: "Can we be your friends?"
Spirit: "Of course! You are both kind and have fun. You have a good spirit. Come, let's play some more!"
*They play on the swing, slide, and seesaw, laughing and singing together.*

Mom: "Anna, you have to eat your soup. It is good for you."
Anna: "I don't like soup. It is hot and wet and yucky."
Dad: "Look, Anna, you can use your fork to eat the cheese. Cheese is yummy and soft and yellow."
Anna: (Looking at Dad's fork) "..."
Dad: "No, Anna, this is my fork. You have your own fork. It is smaller and easier for you to hold."
Anna: (Looking at her fork) "..."
Anna: (Throws her fork on the floor and cries)
Mom: "Anna, that is not nice. You have to pick up your fork and say sorry."
Anna: "..."
Tom: "Here, Anna, you can have my fork. It is big and shiny and has four teeth, like Dad's. I don't mind. I can use my spoon to eat my soup."
Anna: "Thank you, Tom. You are a good brother. I am sorry I was mean."
Mom and Dad: "That was very kind of you, Tom. You are a good sharer. And that was very nice of you, Anna. You are a good apologizer. We love you both very much."
Tom and Anna: "..."

Lily: "Look, I brought a new doll! Isn't she pretty?"
Ben: "Can I see your doll?"
Lily: "OK, but be careful."
Ben: "Let's trade. You can have my car. It is fast and shiny."
Lily: "No, thank you. I want my doll back."
Ben: *silent as he runs away and hides the doll*
Lily: "Ben, give me my doll. That is not nice!"
Ben: *silent, feeling happy with the doll*
Lily: *weeping louder* "I want my doll. I want my friend."
Grown-up: "What is wrong, Lily?"
Lily: "Ben took my doll. He traded it for his car. He hid it. I want my doll."
Grown-up: *to Ben* "That is not nice. You should not take Lily's doll. You should not trade without asking. You should not hide things. You should say sorry."
Ben: "I am sorry, Lily. I was mean. Can we be friends again?"
Lily: "I forgive you, Ben. We can be friends again. But next time, ask before you trade."
Grown-up: *smiling*
*They eat cookies and play with their toys, sharing and taking turns.*

Tom: "Maybe there is a treasure or a toy or a cake inside!"
Sue: "Or maybe there is a monster or a trap or a ghost."
Tom: "Let's go in and see."
Sue: "I don't know, it looks dark and scary."
Tom: *crawls in first*
Sue: *reluctantly follows* "This is not fun, this is boring."
Tom: "Let's go back."
Sue: *notices the hole is gone* "Help! Help!"
Tom: *shouting with Sue* "Help! Help!"
Voice: "Hello, hello, are you there?"
Tom and Sue: "Ben, Ben, we are here, we are here!"
Ben: "Don't worry, I will help you."
Ben: *returns with rope and flashlight* "Are you okay? Are you hurt?"
Tom and Sue: "We are okay, we are okay, thanks to you."
Ben: "You are welcome. I am glad you are safe. You are my friends. Friends help each other. Friends solve problems together. Friends are good."

Sam: "Look at my truck, it is so fast and strong!" *zooming his truck on the grass*
Lily: "My truck is faster and stronger!" *chasing Sam's truck with her own*
Sam: "Let's go get some lemonade, I am thirsty!" *leaving his truck by the fence*
Lily: "Me too!" *following Sam with her truck*
Ben: "Hi, Lily and Sam! Do you want some lemonade? It is only one penny a cup!" *holding a cup*
Lily and Sam: "Yes, please!" *giving Ben a penny each*
Lily: "Yuck! This lemonade is sour!" *spitting it out*
Sam: "Me too! It is not good!" *putting down his cup*
Ben: "I'm sorry, Lily and Sam. I wanted to make good lemonade, but I guess I made a mistake. Do you want your pennies back?" *reaching for his jar*
Lily: "No, Ben, it's okay. You can keep the pennies. Maybe you can try again another day." *smiling*
Sam: "Yeah, Ben, don't be sad. We still like you and your sign. It is very nice. You can display it again when you make better lemonade." *pointing at the sign*
Ben: "Thank you, Lily and Sam. You are good friends. Do you want to play with me and my truck? I have a yellow truck that matches my hat." *showing them his truck*
Lily: "Sure, Ben, we would love to play with you and your truck. Let's go to the backyard and have some fun!" *grabbing her truck*
Sam: "Come on, Ben, let's go!" *picking up his truck*

Ben: "Let's go see the boat. Maybe they have something fun."
Mia: "OK, but we have to be careful. The boat might be bad."
Ben: "Wow, these are pretty. Can we take some?"
Mia: "I don't know. Maybe they belong to someone."
Man: "Hey, you kids! Get away from there! That's my supply of jewels! I stole them from the reef! They are very valuable!"
Ben: "That was scary. We should not go near the boat again."
Mia: "Yes, the boat is bad. The man is bad. The shiny things are bad. They hurt the reef and the fish."
Ben: "Look at this nice reef with many colors and shapes."
Mia: "And look at all these friendly fish. We're happy here."

Lily: "Wow, look at these loops! They are so shiny and pretty. Can we play with them?"
Tom: "Of course we can! Let's see what they can do."
Lily: "These loops are not fun. They are too different from our old loops. I want to play with our old loops."
Tom: "Me too. Let's put these loops back in the box and play with our old loops."
Lily: "Where are our old loops? Did someone take them?"
Tom: "Maybe the aunt took them. Maybe she wanted to trade them for the new loops."
Lily: "That's not fair! We did not want to trade our old loops. We liked our old loops. They were our favorite loops."
(Both start to cry.)
Lily: "I wish we had not opened the box."
Tom: "I wish we had not played with the new loops."
Lily: "I wish we had kept our old loops."

Tom: "Vroom, vroom! Look at my car go!"
Jen: "Mine's faster, watch it zoom around the stadium!"
Tom: "Oh no! My car... the wheel!"
Jen: "What happened, Tom?"
Tom: "It broke! The wheel came off!" *throws car on the floor* "It's ruined!"
Jen: "Tom, don't cry. We can fix your car. I have glue and tape."
Tom: *sniffles* "Really? You can fix it?"
Jen: "Yes, come on. Let's go to the table and I'll show you."
*At the table*
Jen: "See, a bit of glue here... and now some tape to make sure it stays."
Tom: "You did it, Jen! It's like new!"
Jen: "Let's go back to the stadium and race again."
Tom: "Thank you, Jen!" *hugs Jen* "You're the best!"
*Back at the stadium*
Tom: "Ready, set, go!"
Jen: "Our cars are back in action!"
Tom: "Yeah, and look, they're racing just like before!"
Jen: "We make a great team, don't we?"
Tom: "The best!"

Ben: "Look, Lily, I found a green bug!"
Lily: "It is so pretty! Can we keep it?"
Ben: "Sure!" *puts the bug inside the jar*
Lily: "Let's find more bugs!" *runs to a flower bed*
Ben: *follows Lily* "Here's a red one, and a yellow one!"
Lily: "And I found a black bug and a blue bug!" *they put them in the jar*
Ben: "Go away, bee! These are our bugs! You can't have them!"
Lily: "I'm sorry, Ben. The bee was mean. Let's go to mom. She will make your lip better."
Ben: *nods and holds Lily's hand as they run to their mom*
Mom: "Oh, Ben, what happened? Did a bee sting you?"
Ben: "Yes, mom. The bee wanted our bugs. We found a lot of bugs. Look, mom, we have a green bug!"
Mom: "You have a lot of bugs. They are very pretty. But you have to be careful with bees. They can sting you. Let me see your lip."
Mom: *puts ice on Ben's lip* "This will make your lip feel better. It will go down soon. Don't worry."
Ben: "Thank you, mom. You are the best."
Mom: "You're welcome, Ben. You are very brave. Now, why don't you and Lily settle on the grass and watch your bugs? Maybe they will do something funny."
Ben: *to Lily* "Look at the green bug fly!"
Lily: "And the red bug is crawling!"
Ben: "The yellow bug just jumped!"
Lily: "The black bug is hiding!"
Ben: "And the blue bug is shining!"
*Ben and Lily laugh and watch their bugs*

"Hi, Tom!" Mia greets him as he arrives.
"Do you want to play with me?" she asks with a smile.
"Yes, please!" Tom responds eagerly, placing his hat on the table and his toy car on the floor. "What do you want to play?"
Mia ponders briefly before her face lights up with an idea. "Let's play tea party!" she exclaims, fetching two cups and a pitcher from her toy box and filling the pitcher with juice. "This is our tea," she declares.
Tom nods in agreement, clearly fond of juice. He holds out his cup. "Thank you," he says gratefully after Mia pours some juice into it, taking a sip and relishing the sweet, cold taste.
Mia fills her own cup next and is about to drink when suddenly, "Achoo!" She sneezes, and the juice spills from her cup onto her dress, leaving it wet and sticky.
"Oh, no!" Tom exclaims, quickly putting his cup down and grabbing a napkin to help clean the mess. "The napkin is too small," he observes, seeing the big stain forming.
Mia's tears begin to fall, upset by her wet dress. "Don't cry, Mia," Tom comforts her with a hug. "It's okay. It was an accident. You can change your dress."
Mia sniffles and looks at Tom, feeling reassured by his kindness. "Thank you, Tom," she says, returning his hug. "You are very nice."
Tom smiles, happy to have helped. "You're welcome, Mia," he replies with a laugh. "You are very nice, too."

Anna: "Hi! What is your name? Do you want to see the sunrise with me?"
Ben: "Hi! My name is Ben. I am going to school. I like the sunrise, but I have to mind the time. I don't want to be late."
Anna: "Oh. I don't go to school. I stay at home with my mom. She is sick and needs me. I don't have any friends. I am lonely."
Ben: "I am sorry. That is hard. I have an idea. Why don't you come with me to school? You can meet my friends and learn new things. Maybe you will like it. And you can still see the sunrise on the way."
Anna: "Yes, please. That sounds fun. Thank you, Ben. You are very kind. Can I bring my mom?"
Ben: "Of course. She can come too. Maybe she will feel better. Come on, let's go. The sunrise is waiting for us."

Anna: "Hello, dog! You are very pretty. Can I pet you?"
Dog: *nods and licks Anna's hand*
Ben: *hides behind a tree* 
Anna: "Ben, don't be afraid. The dog is nice. Come and say hi."
Ben: *shakes his head*
Ben: "Look, Anna, a purse! Maybe it has something inside."
Ben: *runs to the bench and grabs the purse* "Wow, this is a great purse! I want to keep it."
Dog: *barks and runs after Ben*
Ben: "Hey, stop it! This is my purse!"
Dog: *eats the cookie, plays with the ball and the whistle*
Ben: "Bad dog! Give me back my things!"
Lady: "Spot, come here! I'm sorry, kids, he took my purse. He likes to chew on things."
Lady: *takes the purse and the whistle from the dog, gives the ball to Ben and the cookie to Anna* "Here, you can have these. I'm sorry for the trouble. Spot is a good dog, but he is very curious."
Anna: "Bye, dog! You are very funny. Thank you for the cookie."
Ben: "Anna, let's go home. I don't want to play here anymore."
Anna: *nods and follows Ben*

Lily: "I'm so excited to go to the lake!"
Ben: "Me too! I can't wait to swim and play with the fish."
Dad: "And maybe we can find some logs and sticks for boats and rafts."
Ben: "Look, dad, I found a big log! Can we make a boat with it?"
Dad: "Sure, Ben, that's a great log for a boat. Let's see if we can find some rope and a sail."
Lily: "I have an idea, Ben. We can use this towel as a sail and this stick as a mast. Then we can tie them to the log with this rope."
Ben: "Wow, Lily, you are very smart. That's a good idea. Let's do it."
Lily: "Are you ready, Ben?"
Ben: "Yes, I'm ready, Lily. Let's send our boat to the water."
Lily and Ben: "Look, dad, look! Our boat is sailing!"
Dad: "Wow, you two, you made a wonderful boat. I'm very proud of you. Let's watch it go."

Sara: "Look at all these books about animals, cars, and stars. I love reading them every day!"
(Sara finds a new book)
Sara: "Wow, a new book! And it's so big and shiny!"
(Sara looking at a picture of a chain in the book)
Sara: "Hmm, 'A chain can be used to pull, to lock, or to make noise.' I want to try this out."
(Sara looking around her room)
Sara: "There's my toy box with a lock. Maybe I can use the chain to open it."
(Sara tries to use the chain on the lock)
Sara: "It's not opening... I'll pull harder!"
(The chain breaks and the lock falls)
Sara: "Oh no, I broke the chain. Now I can't read the book anymore."
(Mom enters the room)
Mom: "Sara, what are you doing? I brought you a new book about chains. I thought you would like it."
Sara: "Mom, this is the book I was reading. I found it in my room. I tried to use the chain to open the lock, but I broke the chain. I'm sorry, mom."
Mom: "It's okay, Sara. The chain was old and weak. It was not a good chain. I have a new chain for you. It is a strong chain. You can use it to play, but not to open locks. And you can still read the book. The book is not broken. It is a good book. I love you, Sara."
Sara: "I love you too, mom. Thank you for the book and the chain. Can we read the book together?"
Mom: "Of course, Sara. Let's read the book together. It is a warm day. We can read the book in the garden. Come on, Sara. Let's go."
(Sara follows her mom, happy)
Sara: "I like to read books, learn new things, and be with you, mom."

Anna: "Lily, you look so cute in your pink dress and hat!"
Anna: "Let's have a tea party and then read our favorite book."
Anna: (singing) "Twinkle, twinkle, little star..."
Anna: "Mommy, look at that big slide! I want to try it. Stay here, Lily."
Anna: (sliding down) "Wheee! That was fun!"
Anna: (returning to the grass) "Lily? Lily, where are you?"
Anna: (crying) "Mommy, Mommy, I can't find Lily!"
Mommy: "What's wrong, Anna?"
Anna: "Lily disappeared. She's gone!"
Mommy: "Don't worry, sweetheart. Let's look for her together."
Mommy: (noticing the crack) "Anna, come here. I think I found Lily!"
Anna: "You did? Where?"
Mommy: "There she is, just on the other side of the fence."
Anna: "Lily! Oh, I missed you so much!"
Anna: "Thank you, Mommy, for finding her. I'm sorry I left her alone. I'll never lose her again."
Mommy: "It's okay, Anna. I'm glad we found her too. Let's go home and give Lily a bath."
Anna: "Yes, let's go home. I'm so happy and safe with you and Lily."

Lily: "I love balloons! Look how they fly and bounce!"
Max: "I don't like them... They're loud and mean."
Lily: "Look at my big red balloon, everyone!"
Friends: "Wow, that's so cool!"
Max: "I wish that balloon would just go away..."
Max: (pretending) "Hello, can I see your balloon?"
Lily: "Sure, Max! I didn't know you wanted to play. Here you go!"
Max: (popping the balloon) "Take that!"
Lily and Friends: "Ahhh!"
Max: (laughing) "Ha, got it!"
Lily: "Why would you do that, Max? I'm so sad..."
Max: (feeling guilty) "I thought I'd feel better, but I just feel sorry now. I wish I hadn't done that."

Sara: "Look at the sky, Ben. It's so gray today."
Ben: "And the rain just keeps falling. I wanted to play outside."
Sara: "Me too. I'm sad we're stuck inside."
Ben: "Let's find somewhere we can still have fun."
Sara: "Hey, what about that big tree over there? It has so many leaves."
Ben: "You're right! The leaves might keep us dry from the rain."
Sara: "Let's run to it!"
(They run to the tree)
Ben: "Look, Sara! There's a hole under the tree, hidden by the roots!"
Sara: "Let's crawl inside. It could be our secret place!"
(Inside the hole)
Ben: "This is great! We're out of the rain and it's like our own little world."
Sara: "We can play and talk and laugh here. Who cares about the rain now?"
Ben: "Yeah, and we can keep each other warm and cozy."
Sara: "Let's pretend we're animals! Or pirates! Or even fairies!"
Ben: "And we'll have so many stories to tell."
(After the rain stops)
Sara: "The rain stopped, Ben. And the sun's out now!"
Ben: "I can hear Mom calling us. Let's crawl out and tell her about our adventure."
(They crawl out and run to their mom)
Sara and Ben together: "Mom! We had the best adventure under the tree!"
Mom: "I'm so glad to hear that. And I'm glad you're both safe and had fun."
Sara: "It was like a secret place just for us!"
Ben: "We didn't even mind the rain!"
Mom: "You two always find a way to make the best of things. I'm glad you're my children."

Anna: "Where's Ben? He's always here to play."
Anna: (sighs) "It's not fun playing alone."
Lady: "Hello, little girl. Do you want to pet my dog? His name is Rex."
Anna: (nods and smiles) "Yes, I like dogs."
Lady: "Don't worry. Rex is very friendly. He likes children. He won't bite. He just wants to say hello."
Anna: (giggles as Rex licks her hand) "He's nice."
Lady: "You are very brave. Do you want to join us for lunch? I have some sandwiches and cookies. Rex has some bones and water."
Anna: "Yes, please. Thank you. Can I call my mom first?"
Lady: "Of course. Where is your mom?"
Anna: "She is at home. She is working. She said I can play in the park until noon."
Lady: "OK. Let's go to that bench. You can use my phone to call your mom. Then we can have lunch together."
Anna: "OK. Thank you. You are very nice. And Rex is very cute."
Lady: "You are very welcome. And you are very sweet. I'm glad we met. Maybe we can see each other again."
Anna: "Yes, maybe. I hope so. Maybe Ben can come too. He is my friend. He likes dogs too."
Lady: "That would be nice. Maybe we can be friends too."
Anna: "Yes, we can. Friends are good."
(They walk to the bench. They call Anna's mom. They have lunch. They talk and laugh. They are not lonely anymore.)

Sara: "Look at all these colors, Ben! Let's make pictures of animals and flowers!"
Ben: "Yeah! And cars too! Oh no, we got some paint on the wall..."
Mommy: "Remember, you two need to be careful and not make a mess."
Sara: "Ben, look! There's a big truck outside with lots of paint!"
Ben: "Wow, let's see what's happening!"
Painter: "Good morning! I'm here to paint your house a new color."
Mommy: "Yes, please come in. I'll show you where to start."
Sara: "Can we watch you paint?"
Ben: "Yeah, we want to see how you do it!"
Painter: *opens a can of blue paint and starts painting*
Sara: "That's so pretty!"
Ben: "Let's draw pictures of the painter and the house!"
Sara: "Here, Mr. Painter, we made these for you!"
Ben: "We used blue, yellow, and red!"
Painter: "These are very good. You two are artists!"
Sara: "Thank you!"
Ben: "We made them wild and fun!"
Painter: "I'll keep these pictures. Thank you, my friends."
Sara: "We're friends too!"
Ben: "Let's go tell Mommy about the painter."
Mommy: "You two are very sweet and polite. I'm proud of you."
Sara: "We like the painter and the new color of the house!"
Ben: "Yeah, it's great!"

Tom: "I want my shoes to look nice and smooth for school."
Dad: "Here's a newspaper for you, Tom."
Tom: "Thanks, Dad!"
Mom: "And here's the brush and some polish."
Tom: "Thanks, Mom! I'm going to start shining my shoes now."
(Tom rubs the polish on his shoes with the brush, making small circles.)
Tom: "Look, mom, look, dad, my shoes are shiny and smooth!"
Mom and Dad: "Wow, Tom, your shoes are very shiny and smooth! You did a good job shining them. You are a good boy."
Tom: "Thanks! I'm ready for school. Bye, mom, bye, dad!"
(He goes out the door and walks to the bus stop.)
Tom: "Hi, friends, look at my shoes. They are shiny and smooth!"
Friends: "Wow, Tom, your shoes are very shiny and smooth! You have nice shoes. How did you shine them?"
Tom: "You can shine your shoes too. It is easy and fun. You just need a newspaper, a brush, and some polish."
Friends: "That sounds cool. We want to shine our shoes too. Can you show us how?"
Tom: "Sure, I can show you how. Come to my house after school. We can shine our shoes together."
Friends: "OK, that sounds fun. Thank you, Tom. You are a good friend."

(They get on the bus and go to school.)

Sara: "Tom, let's go visit grandpa today!"
Tom: "Yeah, Sara! I love his big house and the garden."

Grandpa: (opening the door with a smile) "Hello, my little ones. I'm so happy to see you. Come in, come in."
(They enter and notice a big cake on the table.)
Grandpa: "It's my birthday today. I made a cake for us. Do you want some?"
Sara and Tom: (clapping their hands) "Yes, please. Happy birthday, grandpa. We love you."
(They sit down to eat the cake.)

Grandpa: (blowing out the candles) "My wish is to have more days like this. You are the best gift I ever had."

Sara: "Grandpa, we always have so much fun with you!"
Tom: "Yeah, you're a great man, grandpa. We're happy to visit you."

Lily: "Look at my veil! Isn't it lovely?"
Anna: "Yes, it is very lovely. Can we try it on?"
Lily: "No, it is mine. You can't have it."
Ben: "But it's so pretty!"
Lily: "No, you can't have it."
---
Lily: "Look at my veil! Isn't it wonderful?"
Tom: "Yes, it is very wonderful. Can we see it?"
Lily: "No, it is mine. You can't touch it."
Mia: "We just want to look!"
Lily: "No, it's mine!"
---
Lily: "Look at my veil! Isn't it amazing?"
Sam: "Yes, it is very amazing. But why are you so mean?"
Zoe: "You don't want to share with anyone. You are not a good friend."
Lily: "No, you are not good friends. You want to take my veil. It is mine."
---
Lily: "I am sorry, friends. I was very mean and silly. I don't want to keep my veil to myself. I want to share it with you. You can try it on and see how lovely you are. You can play with it and have fun. You are more precious to me than my veil. Will you be my friends again?"
Friends: "We are happy you are sorry, Lily. We forgive you and we love you. You are a good friend. We are glad you want to share your veil with us. It is very kind of you. You are very lovely, too. Come and play with us."

Sara: "I want to watch the princess video!"
Ben: "No, I want to watch the dinosaur video!"
*Both grab the same video*
Sara and Ben together: "Oh no!"
*Video tears in half*
Sara and Ben: *Crying*
Mom: "What happened here? Why are you crying?"
Sara: "The video..."
Ben: "It's broken..."
Mom: "Sara and Ben, you should not tear the video. That is not nice. You should be modest and take turns. Now you cannot watch any video today. Go to your rooms and think about what you did."
Sara: "We are sorry, Mom. We did not mean to tear the video. We just wanted to watch it. Can we say sorry to each other and hug?"
Mom: "That is a good idea. You can say sorry and hug, and then you can play with your toys. Maybe tomorrow you can watch a new video, if you are modest and share."
Sara to Ben: "I'm sorry, Ben."
Ben to Sara: "I'm sorry too, Sara."
*They hug*
Sara: "Let's go play with our toys."
Ben: "Yeah, and tomorrow we can watch a new video together!"
*They go to their rooms to play*

Tim: "Look, Sam, it's the dog and the cat! They are funny. The dog is big and the cat is small."
Sam: "Yes, Tim, they are funny. The dog is silly and the cat is smart. They always chase each other and make noises."
(They laugh and clap their hands.)
Tim's Mom: "Tim, Sam, you have watched enough cartoons. It's time to go outside and play. You need some sun and fresh air. You look pale."
Tim: "But mom, we like the cartoons. They are fun. Can we watch a little more?"
Tim's Mom: "No, Tim, you can't. You have watched too much. You need to move and run and jump. That's good for you. Come on, put on your shoes and jackets. I'll take you to the park. You can play with other kids and have fun."
(Tim and Sam sigh. They turn off the TV. They put on their shoes and jackets. They follow Tim's mom to the car, hoping they can watch more cartoons later.)

Jill: "Look, Ben! A big slide!"
Ben: "Let's race to it!"
Jill: "Whee! This is so fast!" *laughs*
Ben: *slides down* "That was awesome!" *smiles*
Man with Balloon: "Would you like this big pink balloon?"
Jill: "Oh, yes, please!"
Ben: "Thank you!"
Jill: "It's so light and floaty!"
Ben: "Let's see if we can balance it!"
Jill: *giggles* "This is fun!"
Ben: "Oh no, the wind!"
Jill: "Catch the balloon!"
Ben: "It's flying away!"
Jill: "It's too high now..."
Ben: "We can't reach it."
Jill: "I'm sad we lost our balloon."
Ben: "Let's go back to the slide."
Jill: "Yeah, sliding is still fun!"
Ben: "I'm happy again!"

Lily: "Look, mom, I made a shrimp!"
Mom: "That's very nice, Lily. What is your shrimp's name?"
Lily: "His name is Bob. He is a friendly shrimp."
Mom: "That's a good name. Do you want to hang your shrimp on the fridge?"
Lily: "Yes, please. I want everyone to see Bob."
Lily: "Bye, Bob. I'll see you later."
Tom: "Your shrimp is silly and ugly. I don't like it. I made it better."
Lily: "No, you didn't. You ruined it. That was my shrimp. His name was Bob. He was friendly. You are mean and fierce. Give me back my shrimp."
Tom: "No, I won't. It's mine now. Go away."
Lily: "Mom, Tom tore up my shrimp!"
Mom: "Tom, that was not nice. You should not take and destroy Lily's things. You should apologize and make it up to her."
Tom: "But I don't like her shrimp. It's stupid."
Mom: "It doesn't matter if you like it or not. It was her creation. She worked hard on it and she loved it. You should respect her feelings and her work. How would you feel if someone did that to your things?"
Tom: "I'm sorry, Lily. I was wrong. I shouldn't have taken and torn your shrimp. Can I help you make a new one?"
Lily: "It's okay, Tom. I forgive you. Yes, you can help me make a new one. Maybe we can make a friend for Bob."
Tom: "Okay, let's do that. What should we name him?"
Lily: "How about Tim?"
Tom: "That sounds good. Let's go get some crayons and paper."
Mom: "That's very nice of you, Tom. I'm proud of you. And I'm proud of you, Lily. You are very creative and kind. You both learned a valuable lesson today. You should always treat others the way you want to be treated."
The end.

Tim: "Catch, Lily!"
Lily: "Got it! Oh no, I missed!"
Tim: "Be careful! We don't want to lose the ball or hit someone."
Lily: "Look, it's rolling towards that lady on the bench!"
Lady: "Hello, children. Is this your ball?"
Tim: "Yes, it is. We are sorry. We did not mean to bother you."
Lady: "That's all right. You can have your ball back. But please be careful where you kick it. There are other people and animals in the park. You don't want to hurt them or make them angry."
Lily: "OK, we will. Thank you, lady."
Tim: "Goodbye!"
Lily: "Let's not kick the ball anymore. How about we play catch instead?"
Tim: "Great idea! We'll be more careful this time."
Lily: "I liked that lady. I hope we see her again."

Ben: "Look at my orange car! It is very fast and loud. Zoom, zoom, zoom!"
Lily: "I want to play with the orange car!"
Ben: "No, it is my car! You have your own car. Give it back!"
Lily: "No, it is mine now! You have many cars. I only have one!"
Mom: "Ben, Lily, what is going on?"
Ben and Lily: (continue to tug and yell)
Mom: (after coming to the garden and seeing them fight) "You two need to learn to share and be nice. No one can play with the car until you say sorry to each other."
Ben: (looks at Lily) "Sorry."
Lily: "Sorry."
Mom: (gives them a hug) "You can play with the car together if you promise to take turns and be kind."
Ben and Lily: "Thank you, mom!"
(They play with the car and their other toys, making them zoom and laugh.)

Lily: "I'm so happy today!"
Friend 1: "Are you ready for the animal class, Lily?"
Lily: "Yes, I love animals! I even have a dog named Spot."
Lily: "Bye, Mom and Dad!"
Mom and Dad: "Have fun, Lily. Learn a lot. We are proud of you."
Friend 2: (singing on the bus)
Friend 3: (laughing) "Let's play a game!"
Teacher: "Hello, children. Welcome to the animal class. Today we are going to see and learn about many different animals. Are you ready?"
Children: "Yes, teacher. We are ready."
Teacher: "Don't worry, children. The lion can't hurt you. He is behind the bars. He is just saying hello. Can you say hello to the lion?"
Lily: "Hello, lion. You are very big and strong. But I am not afraid of you. I have a dog at home. He is my friend. He barks and wags his tail. Do you have a friend, lion?"
Lion: "Yes, I have a friend. She is a lioness. She is in the next cage. She is very beautiful and smart. She hunts and plays with me. We are happy together."
Lily: "That's great, lion. I'm happy for you. Can I see your friend?"
Lion: "Of course. Come with me. I'll show you."
Lioness: (greeting Lily and the other children)
Child 1: "How do you hunt?"
Child 2: "Do you play together a lot?"
Children: (thanking the lion and lioness) "Goodbye!"
Lily: (thinking) "This is the best day ever."

Ben: "Look, I have a bear! He is big and brown and soft."
Lily: "I have a bunny! She is small and white and cute."
*They hug their toys and smile, playing with the flashlight to make shadows.*
*Suddenly, a loud noise and a flash of light startle them.*
Lily and Ben: "Mommy! Daddy! Help us!"
Mommy: "Shh, it's okay, we're here. It's just a storm. It will pass soon."
Daddy: "Sorry, kids, this flashlight is cheap. It broke. But don't worry, we have another one in the house. Come on, let's go inside and have some hot chocolate."
Lily and Ben: *Nodding, they grab their toys and follow their parents inside.*

Mom: "Please, Lily, you have to take the pill. It will help you get well soon."
Lily: "No, no, no! I don't want the pill. It's yucky!"
Mom: "I know, sweetie, but it's good for you. How about this? If you take the pill, I will let you watch your favorite show. The one with the lovely princess and the funny dragon. You love that show, don't you?"
Lily: "Okay, mom, I will take the pill. But only if you let me watch the show."
Mom: "Deal."
(Then, after Lily takes the pill)
Lily: (makes a face)
Mom: (joins Lily on the couch and cuddles with her)

Lily: "Hey Tom, let's go play at my house after school!"
Tom: "Yeah, I'd love that! I hope we can have some snacks too."
Lily's Mom: "Welcome home, kids! I made you tuna sandwiches and apple juice."
Lily and Tom: "Thank you so much!"
Tom: "Wow, look at all these toys! Dolls, cars, blocks, and books!"
Lily: "Let's play with everything!"
(They play for a long time, making stories and building towers.)
Lily: "Did you hear that noise?"
Tom: "Oh no! The cat ate our sandwiches and juice! We forgot to eat them because we were too busy playing!"
Lily's Mom: (Entering the room) "Don't worry, kids. It's okay. The cat was hungry too. I can make you more sandwiches and juice. But first, let's clean up this mess together."
Lily and Tom: "Okay, mom. We are sorry. We will help you. And we will remember to eat our sandwiches and juice next time."
(They clean up, wash their hands, and eat their new sandwiches and juice.)
Lily and Tom: "Thank you for the sandwiches and juice, we're full and happy now!"
(They hug the cat.)
Lily: "We are all friends here, aren't we?" 
The cat: "Purr."

"Rain, rain, go away. Come again another day," Tom sings, gazing out the window.
"Mia, look! A puddle! Let's go out and splash!" Tom exclaims with excitement.
"No, Tom. We cannot go out. Mom said so. We will get sick," Mia responds, holding her book.
"Books are boring. Puddles are fun. Come on, Mia. Please," Tom pleads.
"No, Tom. I like books. Books are quiet. Puddles are loud. And wet. And cold. No, thank you," Mia insists.
"Look, Mia. I am dry. I can go out. I will not get sick," Tom declares, showing off his dryness.
"Tom, come back! You are wet! You will get sick!" Mia shouts from the doorway.
"Tom, I told you so. You are sick. You need to come in. You need to get warm. You need to rest," Mia says with concern, wrapping Tom in a towel.
"Sorry, Mia. You were right. Books are better. Puddles are bad. Can you read to me?" Tom asks, sneezing.
"Sure, Tom. I will read to you. But next time, listen to me. And to Mom. Rain is not for playing. Rain is for staying in," Mia advises, opening her book.
They settle on the couch, and Mia begins to read.

Tim: "Look, Sam, isn't it great to be out here fishing with the big pole Dad gave us?"
Sam: "Yeah, I can't wait to catch a bunch of fish and sell them at the market!"
Man with a loud voice: "Come and buy my fresh fish! They are tasty and cheap!"
Tim: "That man seems to be doing well selling his fish. He must be smart and rich."
Sam: "Let's try to sell our fish like him!"
(After waiting with no success)
Tim: "Why aren't we catching anything, Sam? I'm feeling pretty sad and bored."
Sam: "I don't know, Tim. Let's go ask that man for a tip on how to catch fish."
Tim: "Hello, sir. We are trying to catch fish and sell them, but we have no luck. Can you tell us your secret?"
Man with a loud voice: "Sure, boys. I'll tell you my secret. I don't catch fish. I buy them from the store and sell them here. It's easier and faster. Do you want to buy some?"
Sam: "No, thank you. We don't want your fish. You are not smart and rich. You are sneaky and bad. We will catch our own fish with our pole. Goodbye!"
(Back at their fishing spot)
Tim: "Let's show that man, Sam. We'll catch a big fish with our own hard work!"
Sam: "That's right, Tim. And even though fishing is hard, it's fun and rewarding. I'm glad we're out here with our pole and bucket."

Mommy: "Lily, you need to take your medicine. It will make you feel better."
Lily: "No, no, no!"
Mommy: "Oh, Lily, are you okay? You have a boo-boo on your knee. Let me get a band-aid for you."
Lily: "I'm sorry, Mommy. I was naughty. I did not take my medicine. Can I have it now?"
Mommy: "Yes, Lily, you can have your medicine now. I'm glad you changed your mind. It will make you feel better."
Mommy: "Good girl, Lily. I love you. Now, let's go to bed. You need to rest and get well."
Lily: "I love you too, Mommy. Thank you for the medicine and the band-aid."

Tom: "Let's tie the box to the tree. Then we can pretend we are sailing on the water."
Sam: "OK."
Tom: "Look, there is land over there," pointing to the fence. "Maybe there are pirates or animals there."
Sam: "Let's go and see. But be careful, it might be dangerous."
Tom: "Hi. Who are you?"
Lily: "I'm Lily. I just moved here. I don't have any friends."
Sam: "Do you want to play with us? We have a boat and a sword. We can have fun."
Lily: *smiles and nods*

Sara: "Look at all these treasures! I'm going to set them up right here like they're all mine."
Sara: "What's this? A big box in the corner? I wonder what's inside."
Sara: "Oh, what a beautiful doll! You have the prettiest dress and the shiniest shoes!"
Sara: "I'm going to hug you because you're my new favorite. I'll put you on display with the rest."
Doll: *sharp teeth and a mean face*
Sara: "Ouch! Why did you bite me? That's mean!"
Sara: *crying* "I don't like this doll. I don't like the attic anymore. I'm never coming back here!"
Sara: "Mom, look at my arm! The doll bit me!"
Mom: "What doll, Sara? Show me where you got this bite."
Sara: "It was in the attic, in a big box. But it was a mean doll with sharp teeth!"
Mom: "Sara, are you making this up? Dolls don't bite. Let's go see this doll of yours."
Mom: "This is the box? But it's empty... There's no doll here, Sara."
Sara: "But it was right there! I don't understand where it could have gone..."
Mom: "Well, it's not here now. Are you sure about what happened?"
Sara: "Yes, but I just hope that doll never comes back."

Anna: "Mia, look! I'm signing songs with my hands now!"
Mia: (smiles and signs back) "That's great, Anna! Let's play and teach each other more signs."
Anna: (searching) "Where's my book of songs? I want to sign a song for mom."
Ben: (reading the book on his bed) "What do you need?"
Anna: "Ben, give me my book! I need it to sign a song for mom."
Ben: "No, I want to read it. It has nice pictures and words."
Anna: "Please, Ben, it is my book. You are naughty to take it."
(They struggle over the book, and it rips)
Anna and Ben: (gasping) "Oh no!"
Ben: "Mom will be mad at us."
Anna: "I know. We were both naughty. Let's say sorry to mom and to each other. And let's fix the book with tape."
(They hug and apologize)
Anna: "Mom, we're sorry. We ripped the book."
Mom: (sighs but then smiles) "I'm glad you're honest and kind. Let's tape the book together."
Mom: "Can you still sign a song for me, Anna?"
Anna: "Yes, mom. I remember some signs. And Ben can help me."
(Anna and Ben sign a song together)
Mom: (clapping) "That was beautiful. I'm proud of you both."

Ben: "Look, Lila, I can make a big wave!"
Lila: "Hey, Ben, that's not nice! Now I'm all wet and cold!"
Ben: "I'm sorry, Lila, I was just playing. Do you want to see something funny?"
Lila: "What is it?"
Ben: "Boo!"
Lila: "Ben, you look like a mummy! A mummy with a long scarf!"
Ben: "It's not a mummy, it's me! Do you want to try it?"
Lila: "Boo!"

Sara: "Hello, I am Sara, the best opera singer in the world!"
Ben: "And I am Ben, the most handsome opera singer in the world!"
(Sara and Ben start to sing a song they make up, with various pitches and speeds, making funny faces and gestures.)
Mom: (Entering the room, clapping her hands) "Bravo, bravo, you are wonderful opera singers!"
Sara: (Stopping singing and bowing) "Thank you!"
Ben: (Also bowing) "Thank you!"
(Sara and Ben run to hug Mom.)
Mom: (Laughing with them) "You two are very creative and funny. You can keep the hat and the scarf and play opera anytime you want."
Sara: "We love you, Mom!"
Ben: "We love you so much!"

Lila: "Let's make a path with stones and sticks from the slide to the swings, Ben!"
Ben: "Yeah, it'll be like we're on an adventure when we walk on it!"
Lila: "Look, here are some big stones and small ones. Let's start piling them up here."
Ben: "Okay, let's lay them out in a line on the grass. This is going to be great!"
Lila: "Oh no, Ben, look! A big dog is coming this way!"
Ben: "It's barking... do you think it's friendly?"
Lila: "I don't know, but I'm scared. Let's hide behind that bench!"
Lila: "Go away, dog! This is our path! You can't ruin it!"
Ben: "It's not listening, Lila. It's just knocking everything over!"
Lila: "I don't like this dog. It's ruining everything!"
Ben: "Miss, miss! Please get your dog! It is ruining our path!"
Lady: "Oh my, I'm so sorry, kids. I didn't see you there. My dog just likes to play. I hope he didn't do too much damage."
Lila: "It's okay, miss. We can fix it. We still have our plan."
Lady: "Thank you, children. I really apologize."
Ben: "Let's get back to it, Lila. We can make the path even better than before."
Lila: "Yes, let's do it. Our adventure path from the slide to the swings will be perfect!"

Tom: "Let's go and look."
Lily: "No, it might be dangerous."
Tom: *jumps into the hole*
Lily: "Tom! Tom, are you okay?"
Bear: "Who are you? What are you doing here?"
Tom: "I'm sorry, Mr. Bear. I was curious. I wanted to know what was underground. Please don't hurt me."
Bear: "You are lucky, boy. I'm not hungry today. But you should not come here again. This is my home. You belong above the ground. Go back to your friend. And remember, curiosity can be dangerous."
Tom: *runs to Lily* "I'm sorry, Lily. You were right. I should have listened to you. I met a grumpy bear underground. He was scary, but he let me go. I learned my lesson. I will not be so curious again."
Lily: "I'm glad you're okay, Tom. I forgive you. But next time, please be careful. There are many things to know and explore, but some things are better left alone."
Parents: "You are brave and smart, Tom and Lily. You learned a valuable lesson today. Curiosity is good, but it must be balanced with caution and respect. Knowing when to stop is also important. We love you very much."

Lily: "Let's play with our instruments, Ben! I love my drum."
Ben: "And I love my tiny guitar. We're musicians, let's make some noise!"
Lily: "We should sing along too!"
Ben: "The garden looks nice today. How about we play there?"
Lily: "Look at that huge tree! It's perfect for our music."
Ben: "Yeah, let's sit under it and start playing!"
(They play and sing happily, then suddenly...)
Lily: "What was that roar?"
Ben: "Look up, Lily! It's a lion!"
Lily: "It looks angry... and hungry!"
Ben: "I'm scared, Lily! Run!"
Lily and Ben: "Help! Help!"
Mom: "What's happening out here? Oh my, a lion!"
(She grabs a blanket and throws it over the lion.)
Mom: "Go away, lion! You can't eat my children!"
(She takes Lily and Ben by the hand and runs inside.)
Mom: "Are you okay, my loves?"
Lily: "Yes, mom, we are okay."
Ben: "Thank you for saving us!"
Mom: "You're very brave and creative. Maybe we can play music together later."
Lily: "That sounds great! But can we have some cookies and milk first?"
Mom: "Of course, my dears."
Ben: "We love you, Mom."
(They forget about the lion and the huge tree, feeling very happy.)

Tom: "Look at that big tree, Anna! It has shiny things on it!"
Anna: "Yeah, they're so pretty! I wonder what they are."
Mommy: "Those shiny things are ornaments, children. They're very pretty, but they're also very fragile, so please don't touch them."
Tom: (whispering) "Anna, let's wait until Mommy is busy, then we can look at the ornaments up close!"
Anna: (whispering) "Okay, let's tiptoe to the tree when she goes to the kitchen."
(Sound of ornaments crashing to the floor)
Mommy: (rushing in) "What have you done? You have destroyed the ornaments! They were very special to me. They were from Grandma and Grandpa. They are gone now and I can't fix them. You are very naughty and you have to go to your room. No more playing for you today."
Tom: "We are sorry, Mommy. We didn't know they were from Grandma and Grandpa."
Anna: "We didn't know they would break. Please don't be mad at us. We love you, Mommy."
Mommy: (sighing) "I love you too, Tom and Anna. But you have to be more careful and listen to me. The ornaments were very important to me and I can't get them back. You have to learn to respect other people's things. Now go to your room and think about what you did. Maybe later we can talk more and make some new ornaments together."
Tom: (sadly) "We're really sorry, Mommy."
Anna: (sadly) "We wish we hadn't touched the ornaments."
(Tom and Anna go to their room in silence)

Lily: "Tom, can you believe we're going on holiday with Mum and Dad?"
Tom: "I know, Lily! I'm so excited! Have you packed your toys?"
Lily: "Yep, all packed. Let's get in the car!"
Tom: "Wow, we're going so fast! Look at all the cows and sheep!"
Lily: "And the trees and houses! Let's make up stories about them."
Tom: "And sing our favorite songs!"
Both: (singing and laughing)
Dad: "Here we are, kids. This big house is where we'll stay for our holiday."
Mum: "Let's grab our bags and toys and check out the inside."
Lily: (sniffing) "Ew, what's that smelly smell?"
Tom: "Yuck, it smells like old socks and cheese... and fish!"
Mum: "Oh dear, we're so sorry. Let's find out where it's coming from."
Dad: "Found it! It's this bin full of rubbish in the kitchen. Someone forgot to take it out."
Mum: "Let's take it outside and throw it away. We'll open the windows and spray some perfume."
Lily: "The smell's gone! The house is fresh and clean now."
Tom: "Thank you, Mum and Dad!"
Both: (giving Mum and Dad a hug)
Lily: "Let's unpack and choose our rooms."
Tom: "I can't wait to see more cows and sheep during our holiday."
Lily: "And to have fun and make more stories!"
Tom: "And let's hope the house stays fresh and clean, no more smelly smells!"

Ben: "Lily, let's play with the TV today! It's big and shiny with lots of colors and sounds."
Lily: "Yeah, I love watching TV. It's so much fun!"
Mom: "No, TV is not for playing. TV is for watching. You can watch TV for a little time, but then you have to play with something else."
Ben: "But why, Mom? We want to play with the TV more! It's fun and nice."
Mom: "TV is fun and nice, but it's not good for you if you watch too much. It can make your eyes tired and your brain sleepy. You need to play with other things that make your eyes happy and your brain smart, like toys, books, puzzles, or outside."
Lily: "I guess that makes sense. We do like making our eyes happy and our brain smart."
Ben: "OK, Mom. We will watch TV for a little time, and then we will play with other things."
Mom: "Good. I love you, Ben and Lily. You are good children."
Ben: "Look at those animals, Lily! And listen to those songs!"
Lily: "And the stories! Let's laugh and clap and sing along!"
Ben: "That was fun, but now it's time to turn off the TV and play with something else."
Lily: "Yes, let's go! We have so many other things to play with."
Ben: "We're going to have so much fun!"
Lily: "We're happy!"

Lila: "Mom, why are we not moving?"
Mom: "Because there is too much traffic, honey. Sometimes there are too many cars on the road and they make a big jam. We have to wait until the jam clears."
Lila: "How long do we have to wait?"
Mom: "I don't know, honey. Maybe a few minutes, maybe a long time. It depends on how fast the cars can move."
Lila: *sighs*

Sara: "Isn't kayaking the best, Tom? I love seeing all the fish and birds!"
Tom: "Me too! And look at this island we've found. It's perfect for a picnic!"
Tom: "Look, Sara, what a pretty necklace!" *picks up a string of shells and beads*
Sara: "It's lovely!"
Tom: *puts the necklace around Sara's neck* "You are very pretty, Sara. Do you want to marry me?"
Sara: *giggles* "Yes, Tom, I want to marry you. You are very nice and funny. But how can we marry?"
Tom: *thinks* "Well, my mom and dad had a ring, a cake, and a party..." *spots a big leaf and a berry* "Here, Sara, this is your ring. Now we are married."
Sara: *puts the ring on her finger* "Thank you, Tom, this is a beautiful ring. Now we are married."
*They share their sandwich and juice and have a cake of cookies. They dance and sing and laugh.*
Sara: "We had such a great day! Let's tell mom and dad we're married!"
Tom: "Yeah, they'll be so happy!"
Mom: "You are very sweet, Sara and Tom. But you are still very young. You can play and pretend, but you are not really married. You have to grow up and learn a lot of things before you can marry. But we love you very much and we are happy that you are friends."
Sara: "I understand, Mom. We're still kids and we've got so much fun to have!"
Tom: "Yeah, and we'll always be friends. And maybe, one day, when we're big, we'll marry for real."

Sam: "Look at my watch! It's blue and shiny and goes tick-tock."
Friend: "Wow, Sam, that's a cool watch!"
Sam: "I feel mighty with it!"
Man: "What a nice watch you have! Do you want to trade it for something in my bag?"
Sam: "Yes, I want to trade my watch for something in your bag. What can I have?"
Man: "You can have anything you want, but only one thing. Choose wisely, because you can't change your mind later."
Sam: "I want the big book, please."
Man: "Okay, here you go. Give me your watch and take the book. It's a fair trade. Thank you, Sam. Enjoy your book. Goodbye."
Sam: "Mom, look at my book! It's so big and nice! Can you read it to me?"
Mom: "Sure, Sam. I'm glad you like your book. It looks very interesting. Let's sit down and read it together. You are a mighty boy, Sam. You made a good choice."

Anna: "Hey Ben, we have a special task today!"
Ben: "That's right, Anna! We need to find the most beautiful flower for our teacher!"
Anna: "Look at all these flowers in the park! Red, yellow, pink..."
Ben: "But we need the most beautiful one of all. What about that hill over there?"
Anna: "Good idea! There might be a perfect flower at the top!"
(They run and climb)
Ben: "Phew, this is tiring, but it's also so much fun!"
Anna: "I agree! I can't wait to see what's at the top."
(Reaching the top)
Anna: "Ben, look! That big, bright, purple flower! It's perfect!"
Ben: "It's the most beautiful flower I've ever seen! Let's pick it for our teacher."
(They run back down)
Anna: "We're tired, but look at our amazing find!"
(Back with the teacher)
Anna and Ben: "We found this flower for you!"
Teacher: "Oh, what a beautiful flower! You both did such a good job."
Teacher: "You're very kind, Anna and Ben. I'm so happy!"
Anna: "We're proud to be your students!"
Ben: "And we're proud to be friends!"
(They hug their teacher and then each other)

Lily: (holding her flute close) ...
Boy with curly hair: (smiling) Hi, what's that?
Lily: (softly) It's a flute.
Boy: Can you play it?
Lily: A little.
Boy: Can I hear it?
Lily: (nods and plays a simple tune)
Boy: (clapping) That was nice. What's your name?
Lily: Lily.
Boy: I'm Ben. Do you want to play with us?
Lily: (looks at her mom, who nods and smiles) Okay.
(They go to the swings and slides and play together.)

Sara: "Tom, can you stir the flour and the eggs?"
Tom: "OK, Sara, I can stir."
Sara: "Good job, Tom! Now we need to add the milk and the sugar. Can you stir some more?"
Tom: "OK, Sara, I can stir some more."
Sara: "Wow, Tom, you are a good stirrer! Now we need to put the batter in the pan and bake the cake."
Tom: "OK, Sara, let's do that."
(Sara and Tom pour the batter, put the pan in the oven, and set the timer.)
Sara: (reading the letter) "Dear Sara and Tom, I miss you very much. I hope you are having fun and being good. I sent you a nice surprise in the mail. It should arrive soon. I love you. Grandma."
Tom: "Wow, Sara, Grandma is so nice! I wonder what the surprise is."
Sara: "Me too, Tom. Maybe it is a toy or a book or a candy. I love Grandma."
Tom: "I love Grandma too."
(Sara and Tom hug each other and smile.)
(The timer beeps.)
(Sara and Tom take the cake out of the oven, let it cool, decorate it with frosting and sprinkles, and write "We love you, Mom" on the cake with a squeeze bottle.)

Polly: "What a beautiful day for an adventure! I think I'll fly to a new place today."
Polly: "Wow, this city is so big with so many people and buildings! But where should I go?"
Man: "What a lovely parrot! You're coming with me."
Polly: "Oh no, this cage is so small. I miss my friends in the deep forest."
Polly: "I need to get out of here. But I can't escape!"
Polly: "I should have had a plan before traveling alone. It's not safe, and now I'm so far from home."
Narrator: "Remember, it's important to be careful when we travel and to always have a plan. And let's be kind to animals, not taking them away from their homes."

Lily: "Look, Mom! I'm a princess in this dress!"
Mom: "You do look like a princess, Lily! And guess what? I have a special present for you."
Lily: "A present for me? What is it?"
Mom: "It's a surprise. But we need to wrap it first before you can see it."
Lily: "Can I help wrap it?"
Mom: "Of course! Let's get the paper and tape."
Lily: "I can't wait to see what it is!"
Mom: "All done. Now you can open it."
Lily: "Wow, a dollhouse! It's so pretty and just the right size for my dolls!"
Mom: "I'm glad you like it, Lily. Enjoy your new toy."
Lily: "Thank you, Mom! My dolls are going to have so many adventures in their new home!"

Benny: "I'm so hungry. I must find some food."
Deer: "Hello, little bunny. Where are you going?"
Benny: "I'm on a journey to find some food. I'm very hungry."
Deer: *whispers* "I know where there's a big carrot patch."
Benny: "Thank you so much! You're so kind!"
Fox: "Hello, little bunny. What do we have here?"
Benny: *tries to run* "Oh no, please don't eat me!"
Fox: "Too slow, little bunny. You're my dinner now."
Benny: "Poor me!"

Benny: "I want my waffles now!"
Mom: "You'll have to wait a little bit, Benny. I'm making them fresh for you."
Benny: "But I don't want to wait!"
(Benny goes outside)
Benny: "Hey, let's play tag!"
Friend 1: "You're it!"
Friend 2: "Now, let's play hide-and-seek!"
(Later, Benny's mom calls from the house)
Mom: "Benny, breakfast is ready!"
(Benny sees the waffles)
Benny: "Wow, these look amazing!"
(Benny eats the waffles)
Benny: "I'm so full, but that was delicious!"
(At the park with his friends)
Benny: "I'm glad we're all here together. What a great day for fun at the park!"
Friend 1: "We always have the best time!"
Friend 2: "And those waffles were awesome!"
Benny: "I'm thankful for you guys and for yummy waffles!"

Timmy: "Ouch!"
Mommy: "Don't worry, Timmy. It's okay. I'm here to comfort you."
Timmy: *cries*
Mommy: "Here, have this yummy apple to make you feel better."
Timmy: *sniffles* "Thank you, mommy."
Mommy: "Is your knee feeling any better now?"
Timmy: *smiles* "Yes, it's better. I'm going to play with my toys again!"
Mommy: "I'm so glad to hear that. I'm always here for you."

Truck: "VROOM! VROOM! I'm a big, loud truck with many wheels, moving things from one place to another!"
Bird: "Look at that! What a loud and large vehicle beneath me!"
Bird: "I wonder how big that truck really is. Let's swoop down for a better look."
Bird: *Landing on the hood* "Oh my, you're a very long and tall truck, aren't you? Too big for me to measure, but still very impressive."
Bird: "What a sight! I'm glad to have seen such a big and powerful vehicle. Time to fly on!"

Timmy: "Look at the birds, Mom! They're so high up!"
Mom: "Guess what, Timmy? We're going to a fair today!"
Timmy: "Really? Yay! I can't wait!"
---
Timmy: "Mom, look! That ride with the swings! Can I go on it, please?"
Mom: "Oh, sweetheart, you're too short for that ride now. But we'll come back when you're taller, okay?"
---
Older Kid: "Hey, little guy, want to play with us?"
Timmy: "Yes! I'd love to!"
Older Kid: "You made a mistake, Timmy!"
Other Kids: (Laughing)
Timmy: (Feeling embarrassed)
---
Timmy: "Mom, look at that butterfly. It's like the birds I watch."
Mom: "That's right, Timmy. And remember, you'll grow taller and be able to ride the swings one day. And it's perfectly okay to make mistakes and feel embarrassed sometimes."
Timmy: "I know, Mom. I'll remember that."

Lily: "Look at this sweet flower, camera! Click!"
Lily: "Grandma will love this picture! I'll mail it to her right now."
Lily, humming happily as she puts the picture in the mailbox: "I can't wait for Grandma to see it!"
Grandma, on the phone the next day: "Lily, dear, I received your mail. What a sweet picture you've sent!"
Lily, beaming with joy: "You really liked it, Grandma? I'm so glad! I want to take more pictures and mail them to you!"
Grandma: "I would love that, Lily. Your pictures make me so happy."
Lily, with determination: "Then I'll take pictures of everything I see for you, Grandma!"
Grandma, smiling: "And I'll treasure every one of them, my dear."

Timmy: "Hi, I'm Timmy. Do you want to play with me?"
Sally: "Sure! What do you want to play?"
Timmy: "Let's add some blocks to my tower and make it taller than the world!"
Sally: "That sounds like fun! Let's do it!"
Timmy: "Wow! It's taller than the world!"
Sally: "No silly, it's not taller than the world. But it's still really tall!"
Timmy: "Thanks for helping me make it taller, Sally. You're a great friend!"

Mommy: "Lily, would you like to come to the grocery store with me?"
Lily: "Yes! I'm so excited!"
Mommy: "Oh no, this is messy. We need to be careful not to slip and fall."
Lily: "I can help clean it up!"
Mommy: "No, it's not safe for you. I'll take care of it."
Lily: "Mommy, can we buy this toy?"
Mommy: "We don't have enough money for it right now."
Lily: *starts crying*
Mommy: "Don't worry, we can save up for it next time."
Lily: *feeling better*
Mommy: "Thank you for helping me put away the groceries, Lily."
Lily: "I'm happy to help, and I had a nice time with you!"

Timmy: "Look, Mittens! I found a shiny penny!"
Mittens: *meows and paws at the penny*
Timmy: "No, Mittens! It's mine!"
Mittens: *continues trying to grab the penny*
Timmy: "Stop that! You'll make it roll away!"
*The penny bounces away and rolls under the fence*
Timmy: "Oh no, the penny!"
Mittens: *meows sadly*
Timmy: "It's okay, Mittens. Let's just play with the ball instead."
Mittens: *purrs and plays with the ball*
Timmy: "This is much more fun than fighting over a penny, right?"
Mittens: *happily meows in agreement*

Lily: "Why are you sad?"
Boy: "I lost my toy car and I can't find it."
Lily: "I understand how you feel. I lost my favorite doll once."
Boy: "You have a pretty lip."
Lily: "Thank you. Do you want to play with me? We can look for your toy car together."
Boy: "Yes, please!"
After some time...
Lily: "Look, we found your toy car!"
Boy: "Thank you! You're my best friend."
Lily: "And you're mine. We'll never be lonely again."

Mom: "Hi, Lily! What are you doing?"
Lily: "I'm looking at myself in the mirror. I like my small nose and my pretty dress."
Mom: "That's nice, Lily. But remember to always mind what you say to yourself in the mirror. You are beautiful just the way you are."
Lily: "Thank you, Mommy. I will always mind what I say to myself in the mirror."

"Timmy, please clean up your toys before dinner," said Timmy's mom.
"But I don't want to clean up!" Timmy protested, throwing his toys everywhere in defiance.
That night, as Timmy lay in bed, he murmured contently, "I love the sound of my fan."
Unbeknownst to him, the fan was quivering on the brink of collapse. Suddenly, it tumbled off the table with a crash, striking Timmy on the head.
"Ouch!" Timmy cried out in pain.
Rushing to his side, Timmy's mom exclaimed in distress, "Oh no, Timmy! We need to get you to the hospital!"
As they sat in the hospital, Timmy's mom sighed heavily, "I wish you had listened and cleaned up your toys... And I should have checked that old fan."
"Don't worry, Mom," Timmy reassured her, despite his injury, "I'll be okay. I just need to rest and get better."

Mom: "Lily, could you please put away your clothes in the closet?"
Lily: "But I want to keep playing!"
Mom: "Lily, if you don't put away your clothes, you can't play anymore."
Lily: *starts putting away clothes and struggles* "I can't reach the shelf!"
Lily: *starts to cry*
Mom: *seeing Lily crying* "Oh, sweetheart, let me help you."
Together: *putting away clothes*
Lily: "Yay, now I can keep playing!"

Lily: "Mommy, what's that sound?"
Mommy: "That's music, Lily. Would you like to learn more about it?"
Lily: "Yes, please!"
Tutor: "Hello, Lily! Today, I'm going to teach you how to sing a song."
Lily: "I can't wait to learn!"
Lily (singing): "La la la, la la!"
Mommy: "You're doing great, sweetheart! Keep practicing."
Mommy: "Lily, look! There are children singing and dancing in the park. Do you want to join them?"
Lily: "Oh, yes! I want to sing with them!"
Lily (singing with the children): "La la la, la la!"
Children (clapping): "Wow, that was amazing! You're a great singer!"
Lily: "Mommy, I want to become a famous singer one day."
Mommy: "With practice and hard work, you can achieve anything you want."
Lily: "I'll sing every day!"

"Lily, could you please help me tidy up your room?" Mommy asked gently.
Lily looked around at the scattered toys and nodded, "Yes, Mommy! I want to help."
After a while, with the room neat and all toys in their place, Lily beamed with pride.
Mommy smiled warmly, "I'm so proud of you, Lily! You did a great job all by yourself."
Lily, feeling accomplished, replied, "I like helping with tidying up, Mommy. I can do it all by myself now!"

Timmy: "Hi, my name is Timmy. What's your name?"
Billy: "My name is Billy."
Timmy: "Nice to meet you, Billy. Can I introduce you to my friends?"
Billy: "Sure!"
(Timmy shows Billy all his friends and they all play together.)
Billy: "I had a great time with you and your friends, Timmy!"

Timmy: "Look at this big, red tomato! It looks so yummy!"
Timmy: *after picking the tomato* "Oh, it's all dirty. I better wash it before I eat it."
Timmy: *the next day in the garden* "Wow, a big, round pumpkin! I want to spin it!"
Timmy: *struggling with the pumpkin* "It's too heavy... I know! I'll spin around myself instead!"
Timmy: *spinning* "Whee! This is fun!"
Timmy: *feeling dizzy after spinning* "Whoa, I need to sit down."
Timmy: *later that day, feeling sick* "Mom, my tummy hurts and I feel filthy."
Mom: "Oh dear, we need to get you to the doctor right away."
Doctor: "I'm sorry, Timmy, but the tomato you ate made you very sick. You must always wash your vegetables before eating them."
Timmy: "I've learned my lesson. I'll always wash them from now on."

Lily: "Look at that big raft floating down the river! It looks like so much fun!"
Lily: "Hey, can I borrow your raft, please?"
Friend: "Sure, you can borrow it!"
Lily: "Thank you so much!"
Lily: (to herself as she floats) "This is so comfy. Wow, look at all the pretty things around here!"
Lily: (returning the raft) "Thank you for letting me borrow your raft. It was amazing!"
Lily: (to herself) "I love borrowing things from my friends for new adventures!"

Timmy: "Mommy, can we go to the store? I really need a new belt for my pants. They keep falling down!"
Mommy: "Of course, Timmy. Let's go find you the perfect belt."
Timmy: "Wow, look at all these belts! There are so many!"
Mommy: "Yes, there are big ones, small ones, and all different colors."
Timmy: "I like this one! The green belt is my favorite."
Mommy: "Great choice! Let's buy it."
(After purchasing the belt)
Mommy: "Here, let me help you put it on."
Timmy: "Yay! My pants are staying up. I feel like a big boy now with my new belt!"

Lily: "Mommy, can you help me? This jar of butter is too heavy for me to carry."
Mommy: "Let's pull the jar together, Lily!"
(They carry the jar to the kitchen and open it.)
Mommy: "Oh no, this butter is not good anymore. We can't eat it."
Lily: (sadly) "But we wasted it..."
Mommy: "It's okay, Lily. We tried our best to save it, but sometimes things just don't work out. Now we've learned to be more careful with our food. Let's go buy some fresh butter."

Max: *barks happily*
Lily: "Come on, Max! Let's go play in the park!"
---
Max: *barks excitedly at the shiny rock*
Other Dog: "Woof! That's my rock."
Max: *wags tail and walks away*
---
Lily: "Look at that big flag waving, Max!"
Max: *barks at the flag*
Lily: "It's okay, Max. It's just a flag."
---
Boy: "Sorry, pup. This is my ball."
Max: *watches the boy play, feeling left out*
---
Lily: "What a day we've had, huh, Max?"
Max: *yawns and curls up in his bed, soon asleep and dreaming*

Tom: "Ah, what a beautiful day to be outside in the sun!"
Tom: "Look at that, a bird's nest under the leaves of this big tree. Hello there, little baby birds."
Tom: "I think I'll come back every day to watch you all grow."
Tom: (returning daily) "My, how you've grown! Stronger and bigger every day."
Tom: (contentedly) "I do love spending my time here with you birds under this tree."

Timmy: "Mom, today I saw a cop walking down the street. He looked so important in his tight and shiny uniform!"
Mom: "Oh? What was the cop doing, Timmy?"
Timmy: "He stopped to talk to a lady. She seemed really sad and scared."
Mom: "And what did you think about that?"
Timmy: "I didn't know what was wrong, but I felt safe. The cop was there to help, I'm sure of it."
Mom: "That's very observant of you, Timmy. I'm proud you're paying attention to what's happening around you."
Timmy: "I'm going to keep watching everything closely, Mom. I want to understand what's going on around me."

Lily: "Mommy, this meeting is so boring. I don't understand anything."
Mommy: "I know, sweetie, but we need to be here a little longer. Why don't we count how many people are here to pass the time?"
Lady in Charge: "Could everyone please number themselves?"
Mommy: "Let's count together, Lily. One, two, three."
Lily: "Three!"
Lady in Charge: "Thank you, everyone. We're done with the meeting."
Lily: "Yay! Can I go outside and play now?"
Mommy: "Yes, Lily. Go have fun with your friends."
Lily (to her friends): "I'm so glad the meeting is over. Let's play!"
Friend: "How was the meeting?"
Lily: "It was long and hard, but I learned that if you listen and do what you're told, it can be over quickly!"

Lily's Mom: "What's wrong, Lily? Don't you like the food?"
Lily: "No, Mommy. It's too salty. Can I have some candy instead?"
Lily's Mom: "No, Lily. You need to eat your dinner. I dare you to try it again and see if you like it."
Lily: *takes a small bite and smiles*

Timmy: "I love playing outside!"
Timmy: "Wow, an adventure in the woods! I'll bring my blue flashlight."
Timmy: "Look, a big ice cream cone! I can't wait to eat it."
Timmy: "Oh no, it's melting because it's too cold out here."
Bear: "Give me your flashlight!"
Timmy: "But... but it's my favorite toy."
Bear: *growls*
Timmy: *reluctantly hands over the flashlight* "I'm so scared."
Timmy: *crying* "I wish I had never gone on this adventure."
Mom: "Timmy, what's wrong?"
Timmy: "I went on an adventure, and a bear took my flashlight, and my ice cream melted."
Mom: "Don't worry, Timmy. We can buy you a new flashlight. But always remember to be careful when you're outside."

"Once upon a time, there was a boy named Timmy."
"Timmy loved to play with his toys, and his favorite toy was a red car."
One day, Timmy's friend came over to play.
"Wow, I like your car! Can I play with it?" asked Timmy's friend.
"Yes, you can play with it. But please be careful with it because it's my own car," replied Timmy.
Timmy's friend was very happy and played with the car for a while. Suddenly, he saw a flag on the floor.
"Look, Timmy! What is this flag for?" he asked.
"That's my dad's flag. He is a dependable soldier and he always carries it with him," Timmy explained.
Timmy and his friend played together for a long time and had a lot of fun. When it was time for his friend to go home, Timmy said, "Thank you for playing with me and taking care of my own car. Let's play again soon!"

Lily: "Mommy, can we go to the market today? I love picking out fruits and vegetables with you!"
Mommy: "Of course, Lily. Let's go get some fresh produce."
Lily: "Look, Mommy! That black cat over there is so cute! Can I go pet it?"
Mommy: "No, Lily. It might scratch you. It's better to admire it from a distance."
Lily: "But it looks so friendly!"
Mommy: "Lily, please listen to me. It's for your own safety."
(Lily ignores her mother's warning and goes to pet the cat.)
Lily: "Ouch! The cat scratched me!"
Mommy: "Oh no, Lily! I told you to be careful. Let's get you to the hospital right away."
(Later, in the hospital)
Lily: "Mommy, I feel so sick. I should have listened to you."
Mommy: "It's important to listen, Lily. Parents give advice to keep you safe because they care about you."
Lily: "I understand now, Mommy. I won't think that I know better next time."
Mommy: "Remember, always listen to your parents, Lily. We want what's best for you."

Lily: "Ouch!"
Mom: "What happened, sweetie?"
Lily: "My teddy bear fell on my finger and it hurts."
Mom: "It's okay, accidents happen. But remember, we should always be careful with our toys and our fingers."
Lily: "I will, Mom. I promise to be more careful."

Lily: "Ready or not, here I come!"
Mom: (singing along to the opera on TV) "La donna è mobile..."
Lily: (whispering to herself) "Wow, Mom's voice is so beautiful!"
(Suddenly, a loud noise)
Lily: "What was that?"
Little Brother: (giggling as he bangs pots and pans together) "Bang! Bang!"
Lily: (laughing) "You scared me! You're so silly!"
(Lily returns to the living room)
Lily: (to herself as she peeks again) "I want to hear more of Mom's singing."
Mom: (continues singing, unaware of Lily's presence)

Timmy: "What was that noise?"
Sally: "Oh no, Timmy! I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to break your toy!"
Timmy: "My favorite toy! How could you?!"
Sally: "I'm really sorry, Timmy. It was an accident."
Timmy: "I don't care! I'm so mad at you!"
(Later)
Timmy: "I've been thinking... It's just a toy. I forgive you, Sally."
Sally: "Really? Thank you, Timmy! Do you want to play together?"
Timmy: "Yeah, let's play!"

Lily: "Look at those fluffy clouds, aren't they beautiful?"
Timmy: "I feel like we should go inside, the sky looks dark."
Lily: "No, the sky is always reliable. It won't rain."
Timmy: "Lily, it's starting to rain really hard!"
Lily: "Oh no, my dog! I have to get him."
Timmy: "Be careful, Lily, the wind is too strong!"
(Sound of a tree falling)
Timmy: "Lily!"

Rabbit: "What a beautiful day to hop around and play!"
Rabbit: "Look at that! A big rainbow in the sky! It's so pretty with all its colors!"
Rabbit (with a sigh): "I wish I could get closer to that rainbow."
Rabbit (disappointed): "Oh, it's so far away. I'll never be able to reach it."
Rabbit (hopeful): "My friends! They're always so kind. Maybe they can help me."
Rabbit: "Friends, I need your help. I want to play with the rainbow, but it's too far away."
Friends: "Don't worry, we'll help you!"
(Together, the friends work and create a rainbow.)
Rabbit (joyfully): "This is amazing! Thank you, my kind friends. Now I have my very own special rainbow to play with!"
Rabbit (thoughtfully): "I don't need the big rainbow in the sky when I have something even better right here."

Lily: "Grandma, I'm so excited to be here! I can smell the spaghetti!"
Grandma: "I made your favorite, dear – spaghetti with spicy sauce!"
Lily: "Yum! This is delicious, but oh, it's hot!"
Grandma: "Be careful, Lily. It's quite spicy."
Lily: (panting) "I need something to cool down..."
Grandma: "There's some milk on the table, sweetheart."
Lily: "Got it—Oops!"
(Sound of whip falling)
Grandma: "Oh dear, I'll pick that up. No harm done."
Lily: "I'm sorry, Grandma. I'll be more careful next time."
Grandma: "Just pay attention, Lily. It's important to be aware of your surroundings."

Boy: "Look at this big game! It's locked. I wish I could play it."
Boy: "Wait, what's this in my pocket? It's a key! Let's see if it works."
*The sound of the lock clicking open*
Boy: "Yes, it worked! Now I can play the big game!"
Boy: "This is so much fun! But, oh, it's getting late. I have to go home now. Goodbye, big game!"

Lily: "Mommy, I'm very tired. Can I take a nap under the big tree in the park?"
Mommy: "Yes, you can nap there, but be careful, okay?"
Lily: *asleep and dreaming* "Hello, Mr. Bunny, can you help me find my way back home?"
Bunny: "Of course, Lily! Follow me."
Lily: *waking up* "Mommy? Mommy, where are you?"
Scary Man: "Come with me, little girl."
Lily: *crying* "I want my mommy! I wish I hadn't napped under the big tree."

"Timmy, come inside now. It's time to eat," Timmy's mom called out.
"Wow, mom! This looks so tidy!" Timmy exclaimed as he saw his favorite meal.
As he went to bed, Timmy thought to himself, "I can't wait to play with my bow and arrow again tomorrow."

Lily: "Mom, can we send a letter to grandma? I want to tell her about my princess adventures!"
Mom: "Of course, Lily. Let's mail it together."
Lily: "Why hasn't grandma received my letter yet? I'm so sad."
Mom: "We've already checked the mailbox, sweetheart."
Lily: "But can we please check again? Just to be sure?"
Mom: "Alright, we can take another look."
Lily: "Look, Mom! The letter was stuck! Now it can finally go to grandma!"
Mom: "I'm glad we found it. Remember to double-check next time you send something important, Lily."
Lily: "I will, Mom. I want to make sure grandma gets my letters!"

Mom: "There you go, Max. You can play on the floor."
Max: *cooing restlessly*
Mom: "What's that, Max? Do you want to move around?"
Max: *excited babbling as he starts to crawl*
Max: "Ooh, what's that shiny thing?"
Mom: "You found it, Max! It's your toy car!"
Max: *happy giggles while playing with the car*
Max: *yawning* "I'm tired now."
Mom: "Come here, sweetie. Rest in my arms."
Max: *content sigh as he falls asleep*
Mom: "Every day is a new adventure for you, isn't it, Max?"

Lily: "Why are you in the cell?"
Bird: "I was caught by a mean man who wanted to keep me as a pet."
Lily: "Don't worry, I'll help you."
Bird: "Thank you so much!"
Lily: "You're free now!"
Bird: "I'm so happy! Thank you, Lily!"
Lily: "Let's wander through the forest together!"
Bird: "Yes, let's be the best of friends!"

Lily: "Look at my painting! I made a big yellow sun with a smiley face!"
Mommy: "That's beautiful, Lily! Now come and eat some yummy toast I made for you."
Lily: "Mmm, it's warm and crunchy! Thank you, Mommy!"
(Later outside)
Lily: "Oh, look! A yellow butterfly! I'm going to catch you!"
Butterfly: *flutters by silently*
Lily: "Oh no, it flew away..."
(Later inside)
Lily: "I'll paint a picture of the yellow butterfly. That will make me happy again."

Lily: "Come on, Max! Let's go to the park and play!"
Child 1: "No, you can't play with us."
Lily: (sits on the bench, looking sad)
Police Officer: "What's wrong, little girl?"
Lily: "They won't let me play with them."
Police Officer: "Don't worry, I'll talk to the children."
(Police Officer talks to the children)
Child 2: "Hey Lily, come play with us!"
Lily: "I win!"
Police Officer: "That's lovely."
Lily: "Come on, Max! Let's go play with our new friends!"

Lily: "I want to go on the swings first."
Rosie: "No, I want to go on the slide first."
Lily: "Let's play a game. We'll go on the swings first, and then we'll go on the slide."
Rosie: "Okay, that sounds fun!"
(After playing)
Lily: "I'm glad we played together nicely."
Rosie: "Me too, Lily. You're a good sister."

Timmy: "Wow, what a beautiful day to play outside in the fields!"
Timmy: (whispering to himself) "Oh no, that's a big, strong bull over there. It looks very scary."
Timmy: (murmuring) "I've got an idea. I'll just peek at the bull from behind this big rock. I'll be super quiet."
Timmy: (surprised) "Hey, you're not scary at all! You're actually quite shy, aren't you?"
Timmy: (cheerfully) "I'm going to visit you every day, Mr. Bull. Here's some fresh grass and water for you."
Bull: (gratefully) "Moo."
Timmy: (reflecting) "I guess sometimes things that seem scary aren't really that bad after all."

"Timmy, come inside, it's time to take a bath," called Timmy's mom.
"But I don't want to take a bath, I'm playing with my friends!" Timmy protested.
"Timmy, if you don't take a bath, you won't be able to play with your friends tomorrow," his mom warned.
Reluctantly, Timmy agreed, "Okay, I'll take a bath."
While in the bathroom, Timmy's curiosity piqued, "Mom, what is that dull rope for?"
"It's for hanging towels," she explained.
The next morning, Timmy was eager, "Good morning! I'm going to play with my friends!"
"Have fun, Timmy," his mom smiled, watching him run off to join his friends.

Lady: "Oh dear, I've completely forgotten my umbrella."
Lady: "This rain is soaking me through!"
Lady: (gasping) "What a magnificent bird! Look at those colorful feathers."
Lady: "It's soaring up so high... and now diving down with such force!"
Lady: (to herself, in awe) "Incredible, how it strikes the ground with its strong feet."
Lady: (excitedly, upon returning home) "Friends, you wouldn't believe the bird I saw today! It struck the ground with such power!"
Friend 1: "That sounds amazing!"
Friend 2: "I wish I could have seen it too."

"Timmy," called his mommy, "we're going to a party today!"
"Yay! A party!" Timmy exclaimed with a big smile.
At the party, Timmy, with wide eyes, pointed at the cake and asked, "Mommy, why doesn't the cake have any candles?"
Before his mommy could answer, Timmy noticed something and giggled, "Look, that man is bowing to the birthday girl!"
He then imitated the man, bowing deeply, and said proudly, "Like this, right?"
Sitting on a chair, Timmy squirmed and complained, "This chair is too big for me!"
He quickly jumped up and called out to the other children, "Let's dance and play games!"
After a while, yawning and stretching, Timmy said to his mommy, "I'm tired, but this was so much fun! I can't wait for the next party!"

"Timmy, grab your club, let's go play some golf at the park!" said Dad.
"I love my thick blue club, Dad!" exclaimed Timmy as they played.
"Look, a rabbit!" Timmy pointed out excitedly.
"Can I pet it, Dad?" Timmy asked with hope in his eyes.
"No, Timmy, we can't use our clubs on the rabbit, it's not nice," Dad explained gently.
Timmy replied with understanding, "Okay, Dad. I know we should be kind to animals."
As they continued to play, Timmy watched the rabbit hop away and said, "I'm still having fun playing golf with you, Dad."
"The end," whispered Timmy with a smile.

Timmy: "I love playing outside with you guys!"
Friend 1: "Look at that dog over there. That dog looks scary."
Timmy: "Don't worry. I know what to do. Watch this!"
(Timmy picks up a stick and throws it. The dog runs after the stick.)
Friend 2: "Wow, that was smart, Timmy!"
(Later at the spring.)
Timmy: "Let's turn the spring and see what happens!"
(They turn the spring and water comes out. Everyone laughs and plays in the water.)
Friend 3: "This is so much fun!"
Timmy: "I'm glad I knew what to do with the dog and the spring."

"Hey Timmy, do you want to join our football team?" Timmy's friend asked with a grin.
Timmy bounced on his toes, a mix of nerves and excitement in his voice. "Yes, I'd love to! But, you know, I'm a bit scared. Football can be really tough."
After a few practices, Timmy panted, feeling defeated. "I can't keep up with everyone. Maybe I should just quit."
His coach placed a firm hand on his shoulder, looking him in the eyes. "Listen, Timmy, it's normal to find it hard at first. But with practice, you'll get better. I believe you can become a great football player."
Weeks later, Timmy, now brimming with confidence, called out during a game, "I got it!" He kicked the ball perfectly into the net and turned to his teammates, beaming. "See what happens when you keep trying and practicing? You can achieve anything!"

Lily: "Look at those jellyfish, Mom! They're like big blobs of jelly!"
Mom: "What's wrong, Lily? You seem scared."
Lily: "I am! Those jellyfish are scary. I don't want to go near the water."
Mom: "Don't worry, sweetie. We can scatter them away so they won't bother us."
Lily: "Really? How?"
Mom: "Watch this!"
*They throw rocks into the water*
Lily: "It's working! They're moving away!"
Mom: "See? Now you can go back to playing."
Lily: "Thank you, Mom! I learned that even if something scares me, there's always a way to make it better."

Lily: "Look at my pretty dress! It fits just right!"
(Later, after falling)
Lily: "Ouch! My knee!"
Mommy: "Oh dear, let me see that."
(She wipes the blood away with a soft cloth)
Mommy: "There, there. A kiss to make it feel better."
(She kisses the scrape)
Lily: "Thank you, Mommy! I love you!"
Mommy: "I love you too, sweetheart. Remember to be careful when you play outside."
Lily: "I will, Mommy. I'll be very careful!"

Timmy: "What's that in the distance? I've never seen it before. I'm going to check it out!"
Timmy: *Sneezes loudly*
Owl: "Oh dear, are you alright, young mouse?"
Timmy: "I'm okay, but this smell from the factory made me sneeze!"
Owl: "That factory is polluting our air. It's not good for us, or the forest."
Timmy: "That's terrible! I want to do something about it."
Timmy: "Family, we have a problem. There's a factory making the air dirty. We need to do something."
Family: "Let's think of a plan."
Timmy: "We could talk to the humans who own the factory. Maybe they'll listen."
Family: "That's a good idea, Timmy. Let's do that."
And they lived happily ever after.

Tim: "I love playing with my toy cars and trucks!"
Mom: "Guess what, Tim? We're going on a trip to the beach today!"
Tim: "Really? Yay! I'm so excited!"
Mom: "Make sure you pack your favorite toys."
Tim: "I've got them all ready! Let's go!"
(At the beach)
Tim: "Can I go swimming now, Mom?"
Mom: "Wait a minute, Tim. I need to put some sunscreen on you first."
Tim: "But Mom, I don't want to wear this! It's too tight!"
Mom: "It's important, Tim. The sunscreen protects your skin from the sun, which can be harmful. Just like how we need oxygen to breathe, our skin needs protection from the sun."
Tim: "Okay, I understand. I'll wear the sunscreen."
(After a day at the beach)
Tim: "I'm glad I listened to you, Mom. I had a great day at the beach!"

Lily: "Mommy, can I try your makeup?"
Mommy: "No, sweetheart, makeup is only for grown-ups. It's not safe for little children."
Lily, whispering to herself: "It looks so pretty, I want to try it too."
*Sounds of makeup being pulled off the table*
Lily, looking in the mirror: "I look so pretty!"
Mommy, gasping: "Lily! Why did you take my makeup without asking? That's wrong, and makeup isn't for little kids."
Lily, with a downcast look: "I'm sorry, Mommy. I didn't mean to be bad."
Mommy: "It's okay, Lily, but you must always ask before taking things. And you can play with makeup when you're older."
Lily, nodding: "I understand, Mommy. I'll always ask first from now on."

Lily: "Mommy, look at the pretty flowers! I see pink ones and yellow ones and purple ones too!"
Mommy: "Yes, Lily, they are very lovely. Let's walk a bit more and see what else we can find."
Lily: "Mommy, can we pet the doggy?"
Mommy: "Let's ask the owner first."
Dog Owner: "Sure, you can pet the dog."
Lily: *pets the doggy*

Timmy: "Wow, look at all these colorful jars!"
Mom: "Timmy, be careful with those."
Timmy: "I will, Mom!"
*Sound of a jar crashing*
Mom: "Timmy! What happened?"
Timmy: "I... I didn't mean to!"
Mom: "That's it, go to your room!"
Timmy: "I'm sorry, Mom. I should have listened."
Timmy: "I promise to be more careful from now on."
*Timmy claps his hands*
Timmy: "Remember, be careful!"

Timmy: "I love playing with my ball in the yard!"
Mom: "Timmy, I have a surprise for you!"
Timmy: "A surprise? What is it? I can't wait!"
Mom: "Here you go, Timmy." *brings out a big box*
Timmy: "Wow, Mommy! What's in the box?"
Mom: "It's a present for you, Timmy. It's a toy car that rolls really fast!"
Timmy: *eyes wide with excitement* "Thank you so much, Mommy! You're the best!" *hugs his mom*

Mimi: "Hello, little girl."
Little Girl: "Hi, kitty. Your tail is so long!"
Mimi: "Yes, it is. Do you understand why cats have long tails?"
Little Girl: "No, why?"
Mimi: "Well, we use our tails to help us balance when we climb and jump."
Little Girl: "Oh, I see. Can I pet your tail?"
Mimi: "Of course!"
(And the little girl gently petted her soft orange tail.)

Rabbit: "I'm so fast, I'm certain to win this race!"
Turtle: "I may be slow, but I will try my best."
Rabbit: "Look at me go! I'm way ahead. I've got time for a quick nap."
Turtle: *continues walking steadily*
Rabbit: *snoring*
Turtle: *passes the sleeping rabbit* "Slow and steady does it."
Rabbit: *wakes up too late* "Oh no, I can't believe the turtle passed me!"
Turtle: "Never give up and always try your best. That's the key to success."

Timmy: "I love playing outside, especially on cold days! The wind feels great on my face when I jump in the leaves!"
Mom: "Timmy, here's a big, warm coat for you to wear. It's very cozy."
Timmy: "Wow, thanks, Mom!" *puts on the coat* "I'm going to run outside and play now!"
*Later, as the sun goes down*
Timmy: *shivering* "Brrr, it's getting so cold!"
Timmy: *thinking to himself* "Dad's work uniform is warm and thick, just like my coat. I wish I had a uniform too."
*The next day*
Mom: "Surprise, Timmy! I got you a uniform of your own to wear on cold days."
Timmy: "It's perfect! Thank you, Mom! I'm so happy!"
*From then on*
Timmy: *playing outside in his uniform* "I'm so warm and happy, and I never shiver anymore!"

Mom: "Lily, let's bake some cookies today!"
Lily: "Yay! I love baking cookies with you!"
Lily: "Mom, our carpet is dirty. It makes me sad."
Mom: "Don't be sad, Lily. We can clean the carpet after we finish baking our cookies."
Lily: "Okay, Mom. Let's finish baking first!"
Lily: "These cookies are yummy! Baking with you always makes me happy."

Lion: "Friends, today we venture to a new place. Follow me!"
Friend 1: "The sun is so bright, and I'm getting tired."
Lion: "Look, a big tree! Let's rest under its shade and have some food."
Friend 2: "This is a nice spot. You've led us well."
Lion: "Now that we're rested, let's head to the river. You can drink and play there."
Friend 3: "What fun! I love splashing around here."
Friend 1: "You're a great leader, Lion. We'll follow you wherever you go."

Lily: "I just love my red skirt; I'm going to wear it to the park today!"
At the park.
Lily: "Look at that cute puppy! I'm going to pet it."
Puppy: *barks*
Lily: "Ouch!"
Friends: "Lily, what happened?"
Lily: "The puppy bit me," *shows her hand*
Friends: "Oh no, that looks painful."
At the hospital.
Mom: "Doctor, please, can you help her?"
Doctor: "Of course, let's take a look. Here's some medicine for the pain."
Lily: *tries to put on her red skirt* "Ow, I can't... it hurts too much."
Mom: "Maybe you should wear something else for now, honey."
Lily: "I guess I'll have to find a new favorite skirt."
Later.
Lily: "This skirt isn't red, but I like it. I'll take care of my hand and wear this one instead."

Timmy: "Mommy, look at this bug!"
Mom: "That's a cool bug, Timmy. But be careful, it might bite you."
Timmy: "Daddy, what's that thing you're using?"
Dad: "It's called a razor, Timmy. It helps me shave my beard."
Timmy: *thinks to himself* (I can't wait to grow up and shave like my dad.)

Lily: "I can't wait to play in the sand and swim at the beach!"
Mom: "Look, we're here!"
Lily: "Oh no, the beach is so dirty! There's trash everywhere. What do we do?"
Mom: "We can do our part, sweetie. Let's help clean up the beach."
Lily: "Okay, let's do it!"
(After cleaning)
Lily: "Now the beach is clean again, I feel so happy and relaxed."
Mom: "You see, Lily, it's important to take care of the places we visit."
Lily: "I've learned my lesson. I'll always make sure to leave places better than I found them."

Lily: "Oh, look at that beautiful butterfly! I'm going to catch you!"
Lily: *panting* "I almost had you! I won't give up!"
Mom: "Lily, lunchtime!"
Lily: "Oh no, I have to go. I wish I could have caught you, butterfly."
Mom: "Here's a surprise for you, Lily."
Lily: "A butterfly net! Thank you, mommy! Now I can catch the butterfly!"
Lily: "I got you! I'm so happy! I love you, mommy! You always make me happy."

Owner: "Oh, how I love this big red ball! It's so bouncy and fun!"
Ball: "I'm glad you're having fun!"
Owner: "No! What's this? A hole? You can't bounce anymore..."
Ball: "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to let you down."
Owner: "I'll try to fix you, don't worry."
Ball: "It's okay, I know you're doing your best."
Owner: "It's no use, you're too broken. I'll go to the store and find a new one."
(At the store)
Owner: "Look at this blue ball! It's just as bouncy as my old red one!"
New Ball: "I'm excited to play with you!"
Owner: "I'm happy to have a new ball to play with."
Red Ball: "It's alright. I had a good run and was loved. Now, I can rest and wait for someone new to come along."
Owner: "You will always be remembered, dear red ball."
Red Ball: "And you'll always be my first friend. The end."

Lily: "I love going to class! I get to play with my friends and learn new things."
Teacher: "Class, today we're going to do a fun experiment. You'll need to step on a balloon to see what happens."
Lily: "Oh, I can't wait to try!"
Teacher: "Be careful, though. It could be dangerous."
Lily: (stepping on the balloon slowly) "I'm being very careful."
(Balloon pops loudly)
Class: (laughing and clapping) "Wow, that was loud!"
Lily: (after class, to her mom) "Mom, we did an experiment today where we stepped on balloons!"
Mom: "Really? And what happened?"
Lily: "Mine popped and made a huge noise, but I didn't get hurt!"
Mom: "That's wonderful, Lily. I'm proud of you for being careful."
Lily: "I love class even more now. I learn and have fun at the same time!"

Lily: "Look at that spider, it's so small and has eight legs!"
Lily: "It's beautiful with its shiny black fur."
Mom: "Don't be afraid of it, Lily. Be brave."
Lily: "I'm going to get closer and look at it."
Lily: "Wow, it's spinning a web! That's so cool."
Lily: "I love spiders now! They're my friends."
Lily: "Mom, come see the spider!"
Mom: "It's beautiful, isn't it?"

Lily: "Look at all these pretty pebbles! I love collecting them."
Lily: "Oh, what's this? A shiny pebble! But it's stuck in the mud."
Lily: (struggling) "Come on, pebble, come out! Oh no, it won't budge."
Lily: "I need something to help me get this pebble out... Ah, a stick! This should work."
Lily: (with effort) "There we go! I got it!"
Lily: "I've learned that if I look for a solution and try hard, I can solve a problem. And even a small pebble like this is valuable and worth the effort."

Sally: "Ah, today's the day for that special potion. Now, where are those frog legs and spider webs?"
Lily: *sobbing* "I'm lost and I'm so scared!"
Sally: "There there, little one. What's your name?"
Lily: "I'm Lily."
Sally: "Well, Lily, I'm Sally the witch. I'll help you find your way home."
Lily: "Thank you so much, Sally!"
Lily: *excitedly* "Everyone, guess what? A kind witch named Sally helped me when I was lost in the forest!"
Sally: *to herself* "Helping Lily felt good. Now, back to my potion."
Sally: "Ah, this is truly the best potion I've ever made. It seems my kindness has made me even more famous!"

"Lily, would you like to help me pack the picnic basket?" her mommy asked.
"Sure, Mommy!" Lily replied, as she carefully placed sandwiches, fruit, and cookies into the basket.
Once they arrived at the park, her daddy said, "Let's see how big our picnic blanket is," and he took out a tape measure.
Lily giggled and exclaimed, "I want to measure too!" She then proceeded to measure the height of the trees and the length of the slide.
After enjoying their meal, Lily's mommy said, "It's time to clean up. Can you help, Lily?"
"Of course, Mommy!" Lily said with a smile, throwing away the trash and feeling proud of her helpfulness.

"Lily, could you help me open this jar of pickles?" asked Lily's mommy.
"I'll try, mommy!" Lily grunted as she struggled with the jar.
*Cat jumps on the counter and knocks the jar over*
"Oh no, the pickles!" exclaimed Lily's mommy, dismayed at the mess.
Lily giggled, "Silly cat!"

"Mommy, what happened to the bird?" Lily asked, pointing at the ground during their walk in the park.
"Sometimes animals die and go to heaven, sweetie," her mommy gently explained.
Lily, puzzled but empathetic, leaned down and kissed the bird, "Goodbye, birdie."

"Lily," said her mom, handing her a small box of paints, "can you paint me a picture?"
Lily, full of excitement, replied, "I'll start right now!"
After a while, Lily presented her artwork. "Mommy, look what I painted! It's a small flower!"
Her mom, with a smile, responded, "Wow, Lily! You are such a great painter! Can you paint me another picture?"
Lily, still beaming with joy, painted once more and showed her new creation. "Mommy, look what I painted! It's a small bird!"
Her mom, filled with pride, exclaimed, "Lily, you are the best painter I know! Keep painting and making beautiful pictures!"

(Friends are riding their bikes and laughing together.)
Timmy: "Oh no, my tire popped!"
Friend 1: "Are you okay, Timmy?"
Timmy: "Yeah, but now I can't ride my bike..."
Friend 2: "Don't worry, we'll help you fix it!"
(After fixing the tire.)
Timmy: "You guys are the best! Thank you so much!"
Friend 1: "Just remember to check your tires before we ride out next time."

Timmy: "Thank you, Mama! I'm so happy!"

Mom: "Lily, it's time to clean the table."
Lily: "Okay, mommy!"
Lily: "Mommy, my ice cream is melting!"
Mom: "Don't worry, Lily. We can put it in the freezer to make it cold again."
Lily: "Thank you, mommy!"

Timmy: "But I don't want to go to bed yet! I want to play with my top!"
Mom: "Timmy, it's time for bed. You can hold your top tomorrow."
Timmy: *Yawns* "Just a little longer..."
Mom: *Picks up the top and places it on the dresser* "Goodnight, Timmy. See you in the morning."
Timmy: *Falls asleep, dreaming about the spinning top*

Timmy: "Let's play trains!"
Billy: "Okay!"
Billy: "Look at all the silly animals on the track!"
Timmy: *smiles* 
*Both making silly train noises*

"Mommy, what was that noise?" Timmy asked, his eyes wide with curiosity.
"I don't know," Mommy replied, holding him close. "But don't worry, I will protect you."
As the subway train came to an abrupt halt, Timmy peered out the window. "Oh no! How will we get home?" he cried, spotting the big blue truck on the tracks.
"Don't worry," Mommy reassured him, her voice calm and steady. "I will protect you and we will find a way home."
Soon after, Mommy's voice was heard again, "Hello, yes, we need a taxi at the subway station."
With the sound of a car pulling up, Timmy's relief was palpable. "Mommy, I'm so happy you're here to protect me," he said, a smile breaking through his worry as they headed home safely.

Father: "What a beautiful morning for us to enjoy together!"
Mother: "Yes, let's all go for a walk and sing our favorite songs."
Daughter: "Look, the sun is rising so early today!"
Son: "It's going to be a lovely day!"
Family (in unison): "Good morning, sir! Why do you look so sad?"
Sad Man: "I've lost my wallet, and I can't find it anywhere."
Father: "Don't worry, we'll help you look for it."
Mother: "Is this your wallet? We found it under the bench."
Sad Man: "Oh, thank you so much! You have no idea how grateful I am."
Son: "Look at those dark clouds! A storm is coming!"
Daughter: "We need to get home quickly!"
Mother: "Oh no, our house... it's gone!"
Father: "Everything we had is destroyed."
Sad Man: "Please, come with me. You can stay at my home."
Mother: "We can't thank you enough for your kindness."
Father: "Even in these hard times, we find solace in the goodness of others."

Lily: "I love playing outside in the sunshine!"
(Loud thunder rumbles)
Lily: "Oh no, what a scary storm!"
(She runs inside and peers out the window)
Lily: "Wow, it's so strong, it's blowing all the leaves off the trees!"
(After the storm subsides, Lily steps outside)
Lily: "Look at this mess! I'm going to help clean it up."
(She starts picking up branches)
Lily: "These branches go in a pile over here."
(Then she picks up leaves)
Lily: "And all these leaves can go into this bag."
(After cleaning, she notices something)
Lily: "Ew, what a big pile of smelly mud!"
(She hesitates but then grabs a shovel)
Lily: "I don't want to touch it, but it's got to be done."
(After some hard work)
Lily: "Phew, that was tough, but I did it! I'm happy I could help clean up after the storm."

Lily: "Mommy, look! I found a penny!"
Mommy: "You're so lucky! Let's pick it up."

Bob: "I'll be fine."
(Sound of stick breaking)
Bob: "Ouch! My eye!"
Max: "Bob, are you okay?"
Bob: "No, I can't see! It's my eye!"
Max: "We told you to be careful. Let's get you some help."
Narrator: "Bob had lost his eye and could no longer play with his friends like he used to. Always listen to your friends and be careful when playing with broken things."

"Timmy, you need to wear other clothes too, not just your red vest every day," said Timmy's mom.
"But I like my vest the best!" Timmy replied.
"Timmy, it's time to study for your test," his mom reminded him.
"I don't like studying," Timmy muttered, "but I know it's important." He then put on his vest and sat down at his desk.
After a long study session, Timmy sighed, "I didn't give up."
On the test day, Timmy whispered to himself, "I'm nervous, but I remember everything I studied."
Later, with a big smile, Timmy exclaimed, "I did really well!"
Proudly wearing his red vest, he said, "Studying is important, and I'll wear my vest proudly every day!"

Caterpillar: "I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole leaf!"
Caterpillar: "Ah, what a big green leaf! Time to feast!"
Caterpillar: *munching sounds* "This is delicious!"
Caterpillar: *sighs contentedly* "I'm so full and feeling wonderfully cool."
Friend 1: "Look at him wiggling around, he's so silly!"
Friend 2: "Yeah, he's really enjoying himself, isn't he?"
Caterpillar: *laughs* "I don't care, I'm just happy to be full!"
Caterpillar: *yawns* "All that wiggling has made me sleepy... time for a nap."
The end.

Lily: "Oh no, I ripped my teddy bear's arm off!"
Mom: "Don't worry, Lily. We can replace your teddy bear's arm with a new one."
Lily: "Can we do it now?"
Mom: "No, we have to go to the store to buy a new arm for your teddy bear. We'll stay here for a little bit longer and then go to the store."
Lily: "Will it be an ancient arm?"
Mom: (laughs) "No, it will be a brand new arm for your teddy bear."
Lily: (hugs her mom) "I can't wait to play with my teddy bear again when it has a new arm!"

Little Bird: "I'm so hungry, I need to find some food."
Little Bird: "Ah, look at those berries!"
Little Bird: "Yum, that was delicious. I'm happy now."
Little Bird: "Good morning! Oh, it's so gray outside today."
Little Bird: "I'd love to play, but first, let's see how much I weigh."
Little Bird: "Only 2 ounces, great! Now, where are my friends?"
Little Bird's Friend 1: "Hey there! Ready to play?"
Little Bird's Friend 2: "Let's fly around and sing our favorite songs!"
Little Bird: "I'm having so much fun, I've completely forgotten about the gray day!"
Little Bird: "Whew, what a day! I'm tired but so happy."
Little Bird: "Goodnight, friends. Can't wait for more adventures tomorrow."

"Lily, it's time to clean up your toys," said her mom as she entered the room.
"But I'm still playing," Lily responded, her fingers reluctantly hitting the off switch on her toy car.
"You can play again later. Right now, please put your toys away," her mom insisted gently.
As Lily started cleaning, she held up a puzzle, "Mom, look! Can I try to finish this puzzle before I put it away?"
Her mom nodded, "Sure, you can keep playing for a little longer."
Lily concentrated on the puzzle, pieces clicking into place. "It's really hard," she muttered to herself, but she persisted.
Finally, with a triumphant smile, Lily exclaimed, "I did it! I finished the puzzle!"
"Let me see," her mom said, walking over. Seeing the completed puzzle, she praised, "I'm proud of you, Lily. You didn't give up, and you finished it. Remember, sometimes things might be hard, but if you keep trying, you can accomplish anything."
Lily beamed, "I'll always try my best and never give up!"

Lily: "I love playing with my toys and the sun is so warm today!"
Mom: "Lily, could you deliver this package to our neighbor, please?"
Lily: "Yes, Mom! I'd love to help!"
(Outside, kids playing with a ball)
Kid 1: "Hey Lily, come play with us!"
Lily: "I wish I could, but I have to deliver this package first."
(Neighbor's door opens)
Neighbor: "Thank you for delivering this package, Lily. You are such a good helper."
Lily: (smiling) "You're welcome!"

Timmy: "I love playing in the backyard!"

Timmy: "I buried my stick in the backyard!"
Friend: "That's really cool! Let's go dig it up together."

Lily: "Mommy, can I have a pastry now, please?"
Mommy: "You have to wait until we get home, sweetie."
Lily: *looks sad but remains quiet*
Mommy: "Oh no, our car seat is going to get wet!"
Lily: "Mommy, can we sit in the bakery and eat my pastry while we wait for the rain to stop?"
Mommy: "That's a good idea. Let's go inside."
Lily: *takes a bite of her pastry* "Mmm, this is so yummy!"
Mommy: "I'm glad you like it, Lily."
Mommy: "Look, the rain stopped. Let's go back to the car."
Lily: *giggles* "Yeah, that would be silly!"

Lily: "Look at that purple butterfly!"
Jack: "Where?"
Lily: "Oh, it flew away. Hey Jack, did you see the purple butterfly?"
Jack: "No, I didn't see it."
Lily: *sighs*
Jack: "Don't worry, let's play on the wide slide together!"
Lily: *smiles* "Yes, let's go!"
*After some time sliding*
Jack: "Look, the butterfly is back!"
Lily: "Let's catch it together this time!"
*They catch the butterfly*
Lily and Jack: "We make a great team!"

Lily: "Hi, can I play with your bucket?"

Lily: "Thank you!"

Lily: "I love playing dress-up with all these costumes!"
Lily's Mom: "Wow, that's a beautiful mask! How many masks do you have?"

Ben: "It's mine!"
Elly: *makes a louder noise*
Mom: "Anna and Ben, stop! You are hurting Elly. He is not happy. You have to share. Elly is for both of you."
Anna: "Sorry, Elly."
Ben: "Sorry, Elly."
*Anna and Ben hug Elly*
Elly: *makes a happy noise*
Mom: "Good job, Anna and Ben. You are very kind. Elly is a famous elephant. He is famous for being soft and nice. He is famous for having two friends who love him."

Lily: "Look, Mom, I'm going to dress Anna in her pink dress and comb her hair!"
Mom: "That's lovely, Lily. Anna looks beautiful."
Lily: "Can we take Anna to the park?"
Mom: "Of course, sweetheart. Just make sure you hold her tight."
---
Lily: "Mom, can I go on the big slide?"
Mom: "Yes, Lily, but remember to hold Anna tight."
Lily: "Whee! That was fun! I want to go again!"
---
Lily: "Give me Anna! She is mine! You are a bad stranger!"
Boy: "No, she is mine! I like her! She is pretty!"
Lily: "No, you are mean! You took Anna from me! She does not fit you! She fits me!"
Boy: "That is not fair! You are mean!"
---
Lily: "Mom, a boy tried to take Anna, but I got her back!"
Mom: "You are brave, Lily. You did the right thing. Anna is yours. You love her and take care of her. The stranger was wrong. He should not take things that are not his."
Lily: "Thank you, mom. I love you and Anna. Can we go on the slide again?"
Mom: "Yes, we can. But be careful and watch out for strangers."
Lily: "I will, mom. I will hold Anna tight."
Mom: "Good girl. Let's have fun on the slide again!"

Lily: "Look, Ben! There's a bird in the yard!"

Bird: (flies and sings)
Lily: "This is fun!"
Ben: "We are so happy!"

Sara: "I love giving you all names and pretty clothes."
Boy: "Vroom, vroom, crash, bang!"
Sara: "Hey, you are bad! You hurt my dolls! Go away!"
Boy: "Sorry, I did not see your dolls. I like to play with my truck. It is fun and loud."
Sara: "But your truck is not fun for me. It is loud and scary. It makes me and my dolls unhappy. You should play somewhere else."
Boy: "But I like this park. It has grass and trees and flowers. And I want to play with you. You have many dolls. They are pretty and soft. Can I play with you and your dolls?"
Sara: "OK, you can play with me and my dolls. But you have to be careful and gentle. And you have to be quiet. No more loud noises. Do you understand?"
Boy: "OK, I understand. I will be careful and gentle and quiet. Thank you for letting me play with you and your dolls."
Sara: "You're welcome. Let's have fun together!"

Sara: "Look, Tom, this is a magic branch! We can wear it like a crown and be the king and queen of the park!"
Tom: "That sounds great!"
(Tom helps Sara put the branch on her head.)
Sara: "It's a bit heavy and prickly, but I don't mind. I feel like a queen."
(Sara gives Tom a leaf to wear on his head.)
Tom: "Now I feel like a king."
(They walk around the park, holding hands and smiling, and approach an old man.)
Old Man: "Hello, little ones, what are you wearing on your heads?"
Sara: "It's a magic branch! It makes us the king and queen of the park."
Old Man: (laughs) "You have a good imagination. Do you know where this branch came from?"
Sara: "No, we don't."
Old Man: "This branch is very old. It is ancient. It came from a tree that was here before the park was made. It was a big and beautiful tree that gave shade and fruits and flowers to many. But a storm broke the tree, and this branch fell to the ground. It's a part of the history of this place."
Tom: "Wow, that's amazing!"
Sara: "Can you tell us more about the tree and the park and the storm?"
(The man shares many stories.)
Sara: "Thank you for telling us all these stories!"
Tom: "Yeah, thank you! Goodbye!"
(They go back to their game, still wearing the branch and the leaf.)
Sara: "We have a magic branch that connects us to the past and the present."
Tom: "And we have a new friend who teaches us about the world."
Sara: "And we have each other to play and have fun. We are the king and queen of the park."

Tom: "Look, I've got a new book with so many pages!"
Tom: (writing in his book) "Tom. That's my name on the first page."
Tom: (writing again) "Big mill, wheel turning... got it on the second page."
Dad: "Ready to go to the mill, Tom?"
Tom: "Yes, Dad! I want to write about everything at the mill today."
Dad: (working at the mill) "We make flour from this wheat, Tom."
Tom: (taking his book and pen) "Mill... wheel... flour... wheat. I'm writing it all down."
Tom: (showing his book to his dad) "Dad, look what I wrote!"
Dad: "You are a good writer, Tom. You write what you see. You write simple words. You write a nice story."
Tom: (smiling) "I like to write. I like my new book. And I like the mill."

Ben: "Zoom! Beep beep!"
Ben: (pretending to be a driver) "Now, off to the races!"
Ben: (noticing the dirt) "Oh no, my cars are so dirty!"
Ben: "Mom, can I wash my cars?"
Mom: "Yes, but you have to do it outside. Here's a bucket of water and a sponge."
Ben: (outside, talking to himself) "This spot is perfect. Time to get you all shiny and clean."
Lily: (approaching) "Hi, Ben. What are you doing?"
Ben: "I am washing my cars. They were very dirty. Now they are very clean."
Lily: "Can I help you?"
Ben: "Sure. You can wash this one. It is blue. It is my favorite."
Lily: (smiling) "Thanks, Ben!"
Ben and Lily: (laughing and talking while washing the cars) "This is fun!"
Ben: "I love playing with cars."
Lily: "Me too, they're so cool!"

Lily: "Whee! I love the slide!"
Ben: "Me too! And the swings are awesome!"
Mom: "Don't forget to drink some juice, kids. Stay hydrated!"
Lily: "Look at that big, blue cooler. Mom always packs the best drinks!"
Ben: "Hey, look at that big brown dog coming this way!"
Lily: "Oh no, he's knocking over the cooler!"
Ben: "Our juice is spilling everywhere!"
Lily: (running to mom) "Mom, mom, the dog is bad! He took our juice!"
Mom: (to the dog) "Shoo, shoo, go away!"
Dog: (barks and growls)
Mom: (feeling helpless, sees a man with a leash) "Sir, sir, can you please get your dog? He is making a mess and scaring my children!"
Man: (coming over) "I'm so sorry, ma'am. He escaped from his leash. He is usually friendly, but he loves juice. Let me help you clean up."
Man: (after putting the leash on the dog and helping clean up) "Again, I apologize for the trouble."
Mom: (hugging Lily and Ben) "Here's a new juice for you both."
Lily: "Thank you, sir!"
Ben: "Yeah, thanks!"
Mom: "Remember, kids, some dogs can be naughty, but some people can be nice."
Lily: "Let's finish our juice and go back to playing!"

Ben: "Look, Lily! A big maze made of tall plants!"
Lily: "Let's go play in it!"
Mom: "Be careful, don't get lost. I will wait for you here."
Ben: "This is so much fun! Which way should we go now?"
Lily: "Let's hide over here!"
Ben: "Lily, do you know how to get out?"
Lily: "No, I thought you did. I'm starting to feel scared."
Ben: "Me too. Mom!"
Lily: "Mom, where are you?"
Ben: "There's a sign! It says 'Exit this way.' Let's follow it!"
Lily: "Finally, we're going to get out!"
Voice from Speaker: "Ha ha, you fell for it. This is a modern maze. It is a prank. You are on TV. Everyone can see how silly you are."
Ben: "I feel so embarrassed."
Lily: "I want to cry. I wish we never went into the maze."
Ben: "I wish we stayed with mom."
Lily: "I don't like this modern maze."
Ben: "I don't like the prank, the voice, the TV... I don't like anything."

Anna: "Catch, Ben!"
Ben: "Got it! Now, your turn, Spot!"
Spot: *barks happily, runs and catches the ball, wagging his tail*
Anna: *laughs* "Good boy, Spot!"
Ben: *claps* "He's so fast!"
Anna: *yawns* "I'm getting sleepy."
Ben: *rubs eyes* "Me too."
Mommy: "It's time for a nap, my sweeties. Come on, let's go to your room."
Anna: "Bye, Spot. See you later."
Ben: "Yeah, see you after our nap, boy."
Mommy: *tucking them in* "Sleep well, my loves. I'll be here when you wake up."
Anna: *snuggling with teddy bear* "Goodnight, Ben."
Ben: *snuggling with his teddy bear* "Goodnight, Anna."
Spot: *snores from the living room*
Anna and Ben: *smile and drift into a nap*

Sara: "Can we jump in the leaves, dad?"
Dad: "Sure, but be careful. Don't go near the fire pit. It is very hot and dangerous."
Sara: "Ben, no! Come back!"
Ben: (screams)
Dad: "Ben, what did you do? I told you not to go near the fire pit. You could have been hurt very badly. Let me see your hand."
Ben: "I'm sorry, dad. I wanted to see the spark. It seemed pretty. I didn't know it was hot and bad."
Dad: "I know, Ben. But you have to listen to me. The fire pit is not a toy. It is for grown-ups only. The spark can burn you and make you sick. You have to be careful and stay away from it. Do you understand?"
Ben: "Yes, dad. I understand. I'm sorry. I won't do it again."

"Let's make snowflakes and stars, Anna!" Tom said, holding scissors and paper.
"I'll show you how to fold the paper and cut along the edges," Tom offered, his hands moving skillfully.
Anna, trying to imitate him, suddenly yelped, "Ow, ow, ow! I cut my thumb! It hurts!"
Tom, rushing over, replied, "Anna, don't cry. Let me see your thumb."
After examining her thumb, he instructed, "Anna, we have to wash your thumb and put a band-aid on it. Come with me to the bathroom."
Once he had taken care of her cut, Tom asked, "There, all done. Does it feel better?"
"Thank you, Tom. You are very kind. You are a good friend," Anna said with a grateful smile.
"You are welcome. You are a good friend too. Do you want to play something else?" Tom asked, eager to continue their fun.
Anna, eager for a safer activity, suggested, "Tom, can we play with the blocks and make a castle?"
"Anna, yes, let's play with the blocks and make a castle. That sounds like fun," Tom agreed, and they headed to the playroom to build a big and beautiful castle.

Ben: "Let's open it and see what's inside!"
Lily: "Okay, but be careful. It might be locked or have something scary in it."
Ben: "I don't understand. How do we open it?"
Lily: "Maybe we need a key or a code or something."
Voice: "Hello, children. Do you want to play a game?"
Ben: "Who are you? Where are you?"
Voice: "I am the suitcase. I have been waiting for someone to open me for a long time. I have many secrets and treasures inside, but you have to solve a riddle to unlock me."
Lily: "A riddle? What is a riddle?"
Voice: "A riddle is a question that has a clever or funny answer. If you guess the answer, you can open the buckle. If you don't, you can try again later. Do you want to try?"
Ben: "Is it a clock?"
Lily: "Or a watch?"
Ben and Lily: "A clock or a watch!"
Voice: "Very good, children. You are smart and adventurous. You guessed the riddle. You can open the buckle now. Go ahead and see what I have for you."
Ben: "Wow, look at all this stuff!"
Lily: "It's amazing! It's like a treasure chest!"
Ben: "Thank you, suitcase, for the game and the gifts!"
Lily: "We'll keep you as our secret friend and visit often."

Lila: "I want to play with Molly now."
Lulu: "No, Molly is my doll!"
Lila: "No, she's not! Molly is our doll!"
*Sounds of struggle as they both pull on Molly's arms.*
*The sound of fabric tearing.*
Lila: "Oh no, look what we did to Molly's dress!"
Lulu: "I feel so sad. We hurt her."
Lila: "I'm sorry, Lulu. I didn't mean to rip Molly's dress."
Lulu: "I'm sorry, Lila. I didn't mean to be mean to you."
*They hug each other and then hug Molly.*
Lila and Lulu together: "We love you, Molly. And we love each other."
*They go to their mom.*
Lila: "Mom, look what happened to Molly's dress. We had a fight."
Lulu: "We're sorry."
Mom: "I'm proud of you both for saying sorry. I can fix Molly's dress."
*The sound of sewing.*
Mom: "Here you go. Molly's dress is as good as new."
Lila: "Thank you, Mom! We promise to share Molly and not fight."
Lulu: "Yes, thank you!"
*Back in their room, playful voices and laughter.*
Lila: "Molly, shake your smooth hair!"
Lulu: "Molly, say something funny!"
Molly (Lila and Lulu making a voice for her): "Let's all laugh together!"
*Laughter fills the room.*
Lila and Lulu together: "We're happy. We're twins."

Tommy: "Look at all these cars and planes I've drawn!"
Mom: "Tommy, why are you making such a mess?"
Tommy: "I'm going to be an artist!"
Mom: "Tommy, what are you doing in here?"
Tommy: "Drawing on this big canvas I found!"
Mom: "That's not your canvas, Tommy! That's your dad's! He's a painter, not a doctor, and you've ruined it!"
Tommy: "But I... I didn't know..."
Mom: "Go to the corner and think about what you've done."
Dad: "What's all this in the trash? Oh, these drawings... there's a signature. 'Tommy'."
Dad: "Tommy, I'm not mad at you. These drawings are wonderful. I'm proud of you. You're an artist."
Tommy: "Really, Dad?"
Dad: "Yes, really. Would you like to draw with me?"
Tommy: "Yes!"
Dad: "Here's a new pencil and a new canvas. Let your imagination run wild."
Tommy: "I will, Dad!"

Lily: "Look, Ben! Let's go to the park with Mom and play on the swings!"
Ben: "Yeah! And we can slide and play in the sandbox too!"
Lily: "Let's collect some twigs and leaves! We can make pretend houses and boats!"
Ben: "Wow, Lily, see that big pile of twigs? Let's go get some for our boats!"
Mom: "Lily, Ben, come back here, please!"
Lily: "I didn't see any sign, did you, Ben?"
Ben: "Nope, no sign. Let's take these twigs!"
Lily: "Ouch, Ben! The bees are coming out of the nest!"
Ben: "They're buzzing so loud! They're stinging us!"
Lily: "Mom! Help!"
Ben: "It hurts so much!"
Mom: "Oh my, come here, both of you. Let's get to the car quickly."
Doctor: "There, there. You'll be okay, but you need to rest at home for a few days. Here's some medicine and bandages."
Lily: "I don't like bees at all."
Ben: "Me neither. I don't want to play with twigs anymore."
Lily: "I don't want to go to the park again."
Ben: "We should have listened to Mom."

Sam: "Pass me the ball, Lily!"
Lily: *kicks the ball too hard*
Sam: "Hey, that's our ball!"
Boy: "No, this is my ball now. I found it."
Lily: "That's not fair! You did not find it, you took it. Give it back to us!"
Boy: "No, this is a brilliant ball. It is shiny and round and bouncy. I like it. It is mine."
Sam and Lily: *kneeling and pretending to cry* "Please, please, give us our ball back. We love our ball. It is our favorite toy. We have nothing else to play with. Please, please, don't be mean."
Boy: "OK, OK, stop crying. Here, take your ball back. But you have to let me play with you. I have no friends to play with. Please, please, don't be mean."
Sam and Lily: "OK, OK, you can play with us. But you have to be nice and share the ball. We can all have fun together. Please, please, don't be mean."
*They all play together, passing the ball and trying to score goals.*

Lily: "Look, this is Grandma and Grandpa. They are very nice and give us hugs and cookies."
Max: *nods and smiles*
Max: "Woof, woof!"
Lily: "Spot, Spot, good dog!"
Lily and Max: *saying hello to each photo, making noises or gestures*
Mom: *opening the door loudly* "Lily and Max, what are you doing? You are making too much noise! You need to be quiet and let me sleep!"
Lily and Max: "Sorry, mom, sorry!"
Mom: "It's okay, my loves, I know you did not mean it. But you need to whisper when I am sleeping, okay? Whisper means to talk very softly, like this." *whispers* "I love you very much."
Lily and Max: *whispering* "I love you too, mom." *they hug and kiss their mom*
Mom: *smiles and goes back to her room, closing the door*

Anna: "Let's rest for a bit. I have some juice and crackers in my bag."
Ben: "OK. I'm hungry too."
(They sit down and open the bag.)
Anna: (Handing Ben a juice box and a cracker) "Here you go."
Ben: (Takes a sip and a bite, then spits out the cracker) "Yuck! This is spicy!"
Anna: (Looking at her cracker) "Oh no, I'm sorry, Ben. These are not for us. These are for my dad. He likes spicy things."
Ben: (Drinking more juice) "It's OK, Anna. I don't like spicy things. But I like you. You are my friend."
Anna: "You are my friend too, Ben. Next time, I will bring some sweet things for us."
(They hug and finish their juice, then get up to play more.)

Lily: "What is this?"
Ben: "Maybe it is a treasure! Let's open it and see!"
Lily: "Wow, this is a treasure! We are so lucky!"
Ben: "Let's try them on! We can pretend we are kings and queens!"
Lily: "Hey, stop! That is our treasure!"
Ben: "Don't worry. We still have each other. We are still best friends."
Lily: "Yes, and we still have our imagination. We can pretend we have any treasure we want."

Lily: "I'm so happy! Today is my birthday!"
Friend 1: "Happy Birthday, Lily! Let's play some games!"
Friend 2: "And eat cake!"
Friend 3: "Don't forget about opening presents!"
Lily's Mom: "Here's a big doll for you, sweetheart."
Lily: "I love it so much! Thank you, Mom and Dad!"
Sam: (playing with the doll) "This doll is so cool!"
Lily: (angrily) "That's mine! Give it back!" (grabs the doll)
Sam: (pulling back) "But I just wanted to play!"
(They both fall down, the doll breaks)
Lily and Sam: (crying) "Oh no!"
Lily's Mom: (seeing the broken doll) "What happened here?"
Sam's Dad: "Looks like the doll is broken."
Lily's Mom: (hugging Lily) "I'm sorry, honey. But you shouldn't have fought with Sam. He is your friend."
Sam: (still crying) "I'm sorry, Lily. I didn't mean to break your doll. Can we still be friends?"
Lily: (feeling warmth in her heart) "I'm sorry, too, Sam. I was mean to you. You are my friend. I still like you."
(They hug each other)
Lily's Dad: "That's good, kids. Friends say sorry and forgive each other."
Sam's Mom: "Now, go have fun together at the party."
Lily and Sam: (nodding) "We will!"
(They go back to playing and eating cake, smiling and forgetting about the broken doll)

Lila: "Where is the key?"
Ben: "I don't know. Maybe Mom has it."
Lila: "Mom, can we have the key?"
Mom: "Not now, sweetie. I'm busy. Go play with something else."
Ben: "Maybe we can use something to unlock it."
Lila: "Like what?"
Ben: "Maybe this will work."
Lila: "Be careful, Ben. You might hurt yourself."
Ben: "I did it! I unlocked the box!"
Lila: "Look, Lila. We can play now!"
Ben: "You're smart, Ben. You unlocked the box!"
Mom: "Kids, come here! The cake is ready!"
(No response from Lila and Ben, they continue playing.)

Lila: "Look, Ben! What's that in the dirt?"
Ben: "I don't know, Lila. It's gray and hard... and look at all those legs!"
Lila: "It's not moving. Do you think it's dead?"
Ben: "Maybe. Let's put it in the jar with the other bugs and see."
---
Lila: "Goodnight, bugs. Sweet dreams of crawling and flying!"
Ben: "Goodnight, everyone. See you in the morning."
---
Firefly: (to itself) "Ah, the moonlight! Time to wake up. Oh, what's this? Other bugs trapped with me?"
---
Firefly: (to the other bugs) "Don't worry, friends. I'll get us out of here."
---
Lila: "Ben, the jar is empty! And there's a hole in the lid!"
Ben: "What happened? Look, out the window!"
Lila: "It's the gray thing we found. It's flying... and glowing!"
Ben: "It's a firefly, Lila! And it's helping the other bugs escape!"
Lila: "Goodbye, magical bugs! Thank you for the light!"
Ben: "We'll always remember you. Not dead, just magic."

Ben: "Look, Anna, that cloud looks like a bunny!"
Anna: "I see it, Ben, it has long ears and a tail. And that cloud looks like a flower!"
(They giggle and clap their hands.)
Ben: "Oh no, the bunny cloud is gone!"
Anna: "And the flower cloud too!"
Anna: "Maybe the clouds are playing too."
Ben: "Maybe they are."
(They hold hands and smile.)

Lily: "Ready or not, here I come!"
Max: *giggle from behind the door*
Lily: "Where are you, Max? I give up!"
Max: *playful smile* "Gotcha!"
Lily: "Help! Help! Spider!"
Max: "Don't worry, Lily, I'll save you!"
Lily: "Where is the exit?"
Max: "Come on, Lily, we can escape through here!"
Lily: "That was scary!"
Max: "Yeah, but we made it!"
Lily: "Let's play something else. No more basement."
Max: "Agreed. Hope that spider stays away."
Lily: "I'm glad we have each other."
Max: "Me too. We're brave together."

Sam: "Give me your car, Ben. It is nice and shiny. My truck is old and dirty."
Ben: "No, Sam. This is my car. You have your truck. Go away."
Sam: *struggling to take the car*
Ben: *holding on tight*
*The car breaks*
Sam and Ben: *crying*
Mom: "What happened here? Why did you break Ben's car, Sam?"
Sam: "I wanted to play with it. It has a good style. My truck is dead."
Mom: "That is not nice, Sam. You cannot take things that are not yours. You have to ask first. And you cannot break things that are not yours. You have to be careful. Now you have to say sorry to Ben and help him fix his car."
Sam: "Sorry, Ben. I was wrong. Can we fix your car?"
Ben: "Maybe. But we need glue and tape. And we need to be gentle."
Mom: "I have glue and tape. Come with me. We will fix the car together. And then you can share and play nicely."
*After fixing the car*
Sam and Ben: "Thank you, Mom."
*They hug each other*
*They play with the car and the truck*
Sam and Ben: *happily playing*

Tom: "Wow, look at the kite! It is so high and fast. I want to fly a kite too."
Lily: "Me too. Let's go and find one."
Tom: "Why does it not fly? The wind is strong. It should fly."
Lily: "Maybe the string is too short, or maybe the kite is too heavy."
Tom: "Oh no, the kite is broken. How can we fix it?"
Lily: "Maybe we can use a patch, or some tape, or some glue."
Tom: "Yay, we did it! The kite is flying. It is so pretty."
Lily: "Yay, we are so smart! The leaf is a good patch. It is like a wing."
Tom: "Uh oh, the kite is gone. The wind took it. We can't get it back."
Lily: "Uh oh, that is sad. The kite was ours. We liked it."
Man: "Hello, kids. Is this your kite? I saw it flying in the sky. It is a nice kite. But it has a hole in it. And a leaf on it. Did you do that?"
Tom: "Yes, sir. The kite was broken. We tried to fix it. But the wind was too strong. It broke the string. It flew away."
Lily: "Yes, sir. We were scared. We thought we lost it. We were sad. Thank you for finding it."
Man: "You're welcome, kids. You are very clever. You used a leaf to patch the hole. That is a good idea. But you need a stronger string. And a smaller hole. Do you want me to help you?"
Tom and Lily: "Yes, please. We want to fly the kite again. We want to have fun."
Man: "Okay, then. Let's go to my house. I have some tools and materials. We can fix the kite together. And then we can fly it again. How does that sound?"
Tom and Lily: "Good, good. Thank you, thank you."

Sara: "Look, Tom, a hole in the fence!"
Tom: "What's on the other side?"
Sara: "Hello, doggy! Do you want to play with us?"
Tom: (giggles) "He's so fluffy!"
Mom: "Sara! Tom! Where are you? It's time to come in and have a bath!"
Tom: "Uh-oh, we have to go, doggy. Bye-bye!"
Mom: "What have you been doing? You are not clean at all! You need a bath right now!"
Sara: "Sorry, Mom."
Tom: "We'll be clean soon."
Sara: "Goodbye, doggy. Hope we can play again."

Tom: "I can't wait to see the comet. The book says it should be here soon."
Jen: "Yeah, I've always wanted to see a comet with a long tail!"
(They go outside with their book and a flashlight, looking up at the sky.)
Tom: "Where is the comet?"
Jen: "I don't know. Maybe it is late."
(They wait, growing cold and sleepy, but determined.)
Jen: "Look, look, the comet!"
Tom: "Wow, wow, the comet!"
(They consult the book.)
Tom: "It says here the comet's name is Halley."
Jen: "I like that name. Hello, Halley!"
(They wave at the comet.)
Tom: "Hello, Halley!"
Jen: "It's beautiful. I'm so glad we stayed to see it."
Tom: "Me too. Ready to head home?"
Jen: "Yes, let's go. We've seen the comet, and it was worth the wait."

Teacher: "Sara, you have a very good talent. I want to display your paintings in the school hall. Everyone can see them and admire them. Do you want to do that?"
Sara: "Yes, teacher, I want to do that. Thank you for liking my paintings."
(The next day)
Teacher: "Look how beautiful and colorful your paintings are on the walls, Sara."
Sara: (Seeing her name on a sign) "I feel so happy."
Mom: "Sara, you are a gifted girl. We are very proud of you. Your paintings are wonderful. You have a very good talent."
Sara: "Thank you, mom and dad. I love you. I love painting. I want to paint more and more."

Tommy: "I love ice cream! I can't wait to try a new flavor today."
Mom: "Take it easy, Tommy. Don't run too fast!"
Tommy (excitedly): "Hi there! Can I have a cone with chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry, please?"
Ice Cream Man: "Sure thing, kid. Here you go, three scoops!"
Tommy: "Thank you so much!" *hands over the money*
Tommy (to himself): "I've got to be careful not to drop this."
Tommy (noticing the girl): "Hi, I'm Tommy. Do you want some of my ice cream? It's delicious."
Lily (smiling): "Hi, I'm Lily. Thank you, that's very nice of you. I would love some of your ice cream."
Lily (after tasting): "Mmm, this is my favorite flavor. You are very kind, Tommy."
Tommy's Mom (watching them): "Sharing is caring. Tommy learned a good lesson today." *smiles proudly*

Anna: "Wow, look at this!"
Ben: "It is a yacht. A big boat that can go on the water."
Anna: "Can we open it?"
Ben: "Maybe we can play with it."
Anna: "Wow, this is cool! But how can we play with it? It cannot go on the water."
Ben: "Let's take it to the slide! We can pretend that the slide is the water. We can make the yacht go down the slide and say 'whee!'"
Anna: "Whee! This is fun!"

Lily: "What's in here? I want to see."
Anna: "Hey, that's mine! You can't read my diary, it's private!"
Lily: "But I want to know what you write. Why do you hide it?"
Anna: "Because it's none of your business. You are too little to understand. Now go away and play with your toys."
Lily: "Hmph, I'll make her sorry."
Anna: "No, Spot, stop! Bad dog! You ruined my diary!"
Lily: "Now you know how I feel. Maybe next time you will share with me."

Tom: "Ready or not, here I come!"
Anna: *thinking* "This spot behind the bush is perfect. He'll never find me here."
Tom: *muttering to himself* "Where could she be? Not by the ball, the swing, the slide, or the tree... Hmm."
Tom: *shouting* "Anna, Anna, where are you? I have a surprise for you!"
Anna: *curiously peeking out* "What is it, Tom? What do you have?"
Tom: "Come here, Anna. I will show you. Are you ready?"
Anna: "Yes, show me."
Tom: "Look, Anna. A frog!"
Anna: "No, Tom, no! I don't want a frog! That's not a surprise, that's a trick!"
Tom: "I found you, Anna. I win! Don't be mad, Anna. It was just a joke. Come on, let's play again."
Anna: "OK, Tom. But this time, I will be the seeker and you will be the hider. And no more frogs, OK?"
Tom: "OK, Anna. No more frogs. You can be the seeker and I will be the hider. But you have to count to ten first."
Anna: "OK, Tom. I will count to ten. One, two, three..." *starts counting*
Tom: *thinking as he runs away* "Hide and seek is fun."

Anna: "What is in the box?"
Lily: "I don't know. It is a secret."
Anna: "Wow, they are so pretty!"
Lily: "Stop! Don't touch them! They are mine! They are from my grandma. She gave them to me before she went away. She said they are very special and I have to keep them safe."
Anna: "But I just want to look at them. Please, can I try one on?"
Lily: "No, you can't! They are not for you. They are only for me. Go away!"
Anna: *sobs and runs out*
Lily: *to herself* "She's gone. I didn't mean to make her leave. I love her. I want to share... but I can't lose these. Grandma said they're special. Oh, Grandma..."
Lily: *after a moment* "I have to find her. I have to say sorry."
Lily: *catching up to Anna* "Anna, wait! Please, I want to show you the secret. I want to play again. Can we look at the pretty things together and smile?"

Lila: "Mom, can I drive my toy car to the park?"
Mom: "Yes, Lila, but you have to be careful and follow the rules."
Lila: "Okay!"
---
Lila: "Hi, I like your car. It is very modern."
Man with beard and glasses: "Thank you, I like your car too. It is very cute."
Lila: "Can I see your car? Can I touch the buttons?"
Man: "Sure, but you have to be careful. Some buttons are not for kids."
---
Man: "You're a smart and curious girl. Do you have a license?"
Lila: "Yes," *shows license*.
Man: "Did you make it yourself?"
Lila: "No, my dad made it for me."
Man: "Your dad is very clever and kind."
---
Lila: *yawns* "I want to sleep."
Man: "I'm tired too. Let's go back to our cars and sleep."
Lila: "Goodbye, thank you for letting me see your car."
Man: "Goodbye, Lila, and thank you for being my friend." *gives her a hug and a kiss*
---
Lila: "Mom, I had an adventure!" *shows license*
Mom: "You are very brave and adventurous. I'm proud of you." *gives her a hug and a kiss*
Lila: "I'm hungry and sleepy."
Mom: "I'll make you some food and then tuck you in bed."
Lila: "Okay." *smiles*
---
*Lila in bed, hugging her teddy bear, falls asleep with her license under her pillow, dreaming happily.*

Anna: "Let's play in the kitchen!"
Ben: "Yeah, we can pretend to cook and wash dishes!"
Anna: "Look, a big green apple on the table!"
Ben: "Let's put the apple in the sink and see what happens."
Anna: "Why?"
Ben: "Maybe it will float or sink or make bubbles."
(They fill the sink with water and drop the apple in. The apple sinks.)
Anna: "Look, the apple is under the water!"
Ben: "Maybe it is too heavy to float."
Anna: "Let's try to get it!"
Ben: "The water's too deep. We need a spoon or a fork."
Anna: "But we can't find any. Mom, can you help us?"
Mom: "What are you doing, kids?"
Ben: "We wanted to see what the apple would do in the water."
Mom: "Well, it looks like it remains in the sink."
(Mom drains the water, takes out the apple, wipes it, and cuts it into pieces.)
Mom: "Here, you can share the apple now."
Anna: "Thank you, Mom!"
Ben: "It's really sweet and juicy."
Anna: "Next time, let's play with something else."

Tom: "Let's ask Mom what this herb is."
Lily: "No, let's try it ourselves. It looks yummy."
Lily: "Yuck! It's bitter and hot!"
Tom: (laughing) "You're silly, Lily. You should not eat things you don't know."
Lily: (angrily) "Here, try this. It's sweet and juicy."
Tom: "Ow! Ow! It hurts! It burns!"
Lily: (scared) "Mom! Mom!"
Mom: (angrily and worried) "What have you done? This is poison!"
Lily: (crying) "I wish I had listened to you, Tom. I wish we were still friends."

Anna: "Look at all these blueberries!"
Ben: "Let's pick some and eat them!"
Anna: "These are yummy!"
Ben: "Yes, they are!"
Anna: "But look, some of these blueberries are glowing!"
Ben: "Wow, look at these!"
Anna: "Wait, Ben! Maybe they are not good to eat. Maybe they are hot or bad."
Ben: *Eats a glowing blueberry* "Ow, ow, ow! It is hot! It burned my tongue!"
Anna: "Here, have some water. I'm sorry, Ben. I tried to warn you."
Ben: "I'm sorry, Anna. I should have listened to you."

Sara: "Look at those flowers, Ben! Yellow, pink, and purple. They smell so good!"
Ben: "Let's pick some for mom!"
Sara: "Oh no, a big bee! It's black and yellow!"
Ben: "It's buzzing so loud. It looks angry!"
Sara: (screams) "I don't like bees! They can hurt us!"
Ben: "I'll help you, Sara!"
(Sara runs to their mom)
Sara: "Mom, a bee! It followed me!"
(Ben swings a stick at the bee and then runs to their mom)
Ben: (screams) "It's after me now!"
(They reach their mom and hug her)
Sara and Ben: (crying) "The bee scared us!"
Mom: "Don't be afraid. The bee is gone now. It wasn't being mean; it was just doing its job. Bees make honey, which is sweet and good."
(Sara and Ben stop crying)
Sara: "The flowers are still pretty. Can we pick some, mom?"
Mom: "Yes, but be careful. Watch out for bees and respect them. They're not enemies; they're friends."
Ben: "We understand. We're sorry, bee. Thank you."
(They pick flowers and give them to their mom)
Mom: "These are beautiful. I love them. You two are brave and smart."
Sara: "We feel happy and proud!"
Ben: "Let's go back to play!"
(They continue playing)
Sara: "We don't see the bee anymore."
Ben: "That's okay. It's busy, happy, and our friend."

Tom: "Look, our truck is so fast and strong!"
Sam: "Yes, it is the best truck ever!"
Dad: "What are you doing? This is not fuel for your truck! This is fuel for the lawn mower! It is dangerous! It can make fire and hurt you!"
Tom: "I'm sorry, dad. We did not know. We just wanted to play with our truck."
Sam: "Me too, dad. We did not mean to be bad."
Dad: "I'm glad you're not hurt. Never touch the fuel again. Now, let's go inside and have some juice and cookies to relax and calm down."
Tom: "We loved our truck."
Sam: "We wish we had not used the wrong fuel."

Tim: "Mia, isn't it fun to play in the park? Look at all the trees, flowers, birds, and bugs!"
Mia: "Yes, Tim! Let's pretend we're explorers!"
Tim: "Look, a big hill! Let's climb it and see what's on the other side."
Mia: "Okay, let's do it!"
(As they climb)
Mia: "Tim, I don't want to climb anymore. It is too hard and scary."
Tim: "Come on, Mia, don't give up. We are almost there. I want to see what is on the other side. Maybe there is a treasure or a castle or a dragon."
Mia: "No, Tim, I want to go back. I want to play on the swings or the slide or the sandbox. They are more fun and safe."
(They look at each other, unsure)
Mom: "Tim, Mia, where are you? It is time to go home. Come down, please."
Tim and Mia: "Surrender!"
(They roll down the hill)
Tim: "That was fun!"
Mia: "We're not mad anymore. We're happy!"
(They run to their mom)
Tim: "Mom, we had an adventure!"
Mia: "We climbed a hill, but it was too steep!"
Mom: "You are brave and smart. I love you."
(They go home)
Tim and Mia: (in unison, as they dream) "We are friends. We are explorers."

Lily: "I'm so bored."
Ben: "Me too. I wish we could play outside."
Lily: "Look at that big puddle outside the window!"
Ben: "Yeah, I see it. What if we..."
Lily: "Let's put on our boots and coats and go to the puddle!"
Ben: "OK!"
(They run to the door and open it)
Lily: "Hey, there's a goat in our yard!"
Ben: "And it's eating our flowers!"
Lily: (shouting) "Hey, goat, stop that!"
(The goat looks at them and makes a loud noise but continues eating)
Ben: "It's not stopping. Let's go to the puddle."
(They pick up sticks and dip them in the water)
Ben: (spraying water) "Shoo, goat, shoo!"
(The goat shakes its head and runs away)
Lily: (laughing) "That was fun!"
Ben: "Yeah, I forgot all about the rain!"
Lily: "Me too. I'm happy now."

Anna: "Look, a big box near the fence!"
Ben: "Let's see what's inside."
(They run to the box and open it.)
Anna: "What is this?"
Ben: "It is a thing to look at the stars. I saw a picture of one in a book."
Anna: "Can we try it?"
Ben: "Yes, but we have to wait for the night."
(They put the telescope in a safe place and go back to play. Later, as the sun goes down.)
Anna: "Mom, can we use the telescope now?"
Mom: "Okay, but be careful and don't stay up too late."
(Mom helps them set up the telescope in the garden.)
Mom: "Now you can gaze at the stars."
(Anna and Ben take turns looking through the telescope.)
Anna: "Wow, they are so pretty. What are they?"
Mom: "They are stars and planets. They are very far away from the earth."
Ben: "What is the earth?"
Mom: "The earth is where we live. It is a big ball too, but we can't see it from here."
Anna: "Can we go to the stars and planets?"
Mom: "Maybe one day, when you grow up. But for now, you can enjoy their gentle light and wonder about them."
(Anna and Ben nod and continue gazing at the stars and planets.)
Anna: "Thank you for the telescope, mom."
Ben: "Yes, thank you!"
(They give mom a hug and then go to bed, dreaming of space.)

Mia: "Look, I made a castle with my blocks! It has a princess and a dragon and a knight!"
Ben: "That's cool, Mia! Can I play with your dragon?"
Mia: "OK, but be careful. He is very fierce and can breathe fire!"
Ben: "Rrrr! I am the dragon and I will burn your castle!"
Mia: "Hey, stop that! You are ruining my story! The dragon is nice and the knight is his friend!"
Ben: "No, the dragon is mean and the knight is his enemy!"
Mia: "Look what you did! You broke my dragon! He was my favorite object!"
Ben: "I'm sorry, Mia! I didn't mean to break him! Can we fix him?"
Mia: "Thank you, Ben! You are a good brother! I like your new tail for my dragon! It is original and pretty!"

Lily: "Look at our tower, Tom! It's so tall!"
Tom: "Yeah! And our bridge is awesome!"
Sam: (laughing) "This is more fun!"
Lily: (crying) "Stop it, Sam! You are mean and naughty! You ruined our game!"
Tom: (shouting) "Yeah, you ruined it!"
Mom: "Sam, what did you do? You should not destroy your siblings' toys. You should be kind and share. Go to your room and think about what you did."
Mom: "I'm sorry, my loves. Don't worry, we can fix the blocks and play again. You did a good job building. I'm proud of you."
Mom: "Let's go to the couch and read a story. That will make you feel better."
Lily: (nodding)
Tom: (smiling)

Sara: "Let's draw something with the pen."
Ben: "OK, what do you want to draw?"
Sara: "I want to draw a flower. You can draw a car."
(They sit on the grass and start to draw.)
Sara: "Look, this is my flower. It is yellow and pretty."
Ben: "Look, this is my car. It is red and fast."
(They are happy with their drawings and play with the ball.)
(A big dog runs to them and grabs the paper with its mouth.)
Sara and Ben: "Hey, that's our paper! Give it back!"
(They chase the dog but it is too fast.)
Sara: "Oh no, our pen is broken too. Now we can't draw anymore."
Ben: (picks up the pen and tries to write with it, then throws it away) "It's OK, Sara. We can get a new pen. And we can draw again. Maybe we can draw something else. Like a bird or a star."
Sara: "You're right, Ben. We can draw again. And we can play with the ball. And we can have fun at the park. You're a good friend."
(They hug each other and play with the ball.)

Mom: "Lily, we have to go to the store. Can you help me get ready?"
Lily: "Yes, Mom!" *runs to her room* "But I want to bring my doll... Where is she?"
*after searching*
Lily: "Mom, I can't find my doll. I want to bring her with me. Where is she?"
Mom: "I don't know, Lily. Did you put her away last time you played with her?"
Lily: *nods, starts to cry* "I'm not sure. Maybe someone took her."
Mom: "Don't worry, Lily. We will find your doll. Maybe she is in the living room or the kitchen. Let's go look together."
*in the living room*
Lily: "Tom, that's my doll! Give her back to me! You are bad!"
Tom: "No, Lily, this is my doll now. She likes me better than you. You are bad!" *sticks out tongue*
*they fight over the doll*
Mom: "Stop it, both of you! You are being very naughty. Tom, give Lily her doll back. She is not yours. Lily, don't hit your brother. He is not bad. You are both good, but you need to share and be nice."
*after resolving the conflict*
Lily: "I'm sorry, mom. I'm sorry, Tom."
Tom: "I'm sorry, Lily."
Both: "We love you, mom. We love you, Lily. We love you, Tom."
Mom: "That's better. Now, let's go to the store."
*they put away their toys and leave for the store*

Tommy: "Dad, can we fly the kite here at home?"
Dad: "No, Tommy. It's too windy and there's not enough space. We can go to the park later."
Tommy: *sighs* "I want to soar now..."
Tommy: *to himself* "Aha! I have an idea."
Mom: "Tommy! What happened to the balloon I bought for your birthday?"
Tommy: *gulps* "I... I don't know where the kite and balloon are, Mom."
Mom: "Tommy, did you take the balloon without asking? And why is your window open?"

Ben: "Let's slide and swing, Lily!"
Lily: "And don't forget running! But I also want to search for things today."
Ben: "Yeah! Bugs, flowers, rocks... maybe we'll find something special like a shiny coin or a feather!"
Lily: "Look, Ben! A big hill! Do you think we can climb it and see what's on the other side?"
Ben: "Let's ask Mom if we can go."
Mom: "Yes, you can go, but be careful and come back soon."
Ben: "We made it to the top, Lily! And look, what a surprise!"
Lily: "A big lake with ducks and fish, and a boat with a sail that's red and white. It looks powerful!"
Ben: "Let's go on the boat and sail on the lake!"
Man: "Hello, who are you?"
Lily: "We're Ben and Lily. We didn't see you there."
Man: "This is my boat. You can't just come and take it. Get off now!"
Ben: "We're sorry, sir. We didn't mean to take your boat. We just wanted to have fun."
Lily: "We're trying to get off, but the boat is moving!"
Ben: "Help! Help!"
Lily: "We want our mom!"
Ben: "We want to go back to the park!"
Lily: "We don't like this boat, or the lake, or the man!"
Ben: "I wish we never climbed the hill or saw this surprise."

Lily: "Look, mom, they are marching! They look like soldiers!"
Mom: "Yes, they do. They march to keep warm and to stay together. It is very cold where they live."
Max: "Can we march like them?"
Mom: "Sure, why not? Let's march around the pool and see if they notice us."
Lily: "Ow, ow, ow! Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
Max: "Mom, mom, mom! The penguin is mean! He bit us!"
Mom: "I'm sorry, kids. That penguin was not nice. He did not like your marching. He thought you were making fun of him. He wanted to protect his group. He did not know you were just playing."
Lily: "Can we say sorry to the penguin?"
Mom: "Maybe later. Let's go see some other animals first. How about the monkeys? They like to play too."

Sara: "Look at all our shiny gems! I love the red one the most."
Ben: "Yeah, the blue one is pretty cool too."
Later that night...
Sara: "Good night, Mom and Dad!"
Ben: "Good night!"
After Sara falls asleep...
Ben: *whispers* "I really want that red gem, it's shinier."
In the morning...
Sara: "Hey! Why is there a blue gem by my bed? Ben, did you take my red gem?"
Ben: *clutching the red gem* "No, it's mine now!"
Sara: "Give me back my red gem!"
Ben: "No, I found it!"
Their parents enter...
Mom: "What's going on here?"
Sara: "Ben took my red gem!"
Ben: "No, I didn't! I found it!"
Dad: *examining the gem* "This is Sara's gem. It has her initial on it. Ben, you should not take things that are not yours. That's not nice."
Ben: "I'm sorry, Sara. Here's your red gem back."
Sara: "It's okay, I forgive you."
Mom and Dad: "Remember to share and play nicely. We love you both."
Sara and Ben: "We love you too."
Together...
Sara: "Let's put the gems back and play together."
Ben: "Yeah, that will be more fun!"

Tommy: "Look at this shiny thing I found in the park! I wonder what it is."
Mom: *enters room* "Tommy! What is that? That shiny thing is dangerous!"
Tommy: "Dangerous? But I just wanted to examine it more. It's round and smooth and has a hole in the middle."
Mom: "That's because it's a memory of a war. It could explode! It's bad, Tommy, really bad."
Tommy: "Explode?"
Mom: *takes the shiny thing* "I'm calling someone to take it away. I'm sorry, Tommy, but you can't examine things when you don't know what they are."
Tommy: "But I like to examine things..."
Mom: "I'm just glad you're safe. Please, promise me you'll be more careful."
Tommy: "I don't understand. What's a war? What's a memory? Why can't I examine it?"
Mom: "Some things are just not safe to explore, honey. We need to leave them alone."
Tommy: *feels sad and confused* "What else can't I examine? What else do I not know?"

Tom: "Hello, mule! What is your name?"
Sue: "Can we pet you, mule?"
Sue: "Ouch!"
Tom: "Don't cry, Sue. The mule did not mean to hurt you. He is new here. He does not know us. He needs time to be our friend."
Sue: *nods*
Tom: "Maybe we can give him some food. Maybe he likes apples or carrots. Then he will see we are nice."
Sue: *smiles*
Tom: "Look, Sue. The mule is glowing. He likes us. He is not shy anymore."
Sue: "Look, Tom. The mule is coming to us. He wants to be petted. He is not scared anymore."
Tom: "Moe is a good mule. He likes us and the farm. He is easy to love."

Anna: "Look at all these shapes! I'm going to make a house."
Ben: "And I'm going to make a rocket!"
Anna: "I need this red triangle for my house roof."
Ben: "But I need it for my rocket nose!"
Both: "Let go! It's mine!"
Anna: "No, it's mine! I saw it first!"
Mom: "What is going on here?"
Ben: "Anna took my red triangle!"
Anna: "Ben took my red triangle!"
Mom: "Shapes are for sharing, not for fighting. You have to be kind and fair, take turns, and ask nicely. Fighting over shapes is not fun."
Anna: "Sorry, Mom."
Ben: "Sorry, Anna."
Anna: "Sorry, Ben."
Ben: "Let's put the red triangle back and pick other shapes."
Anna: "That's a great idea! Let's make something new together."
Ben: "And let's make sure to share and help each other out."
Anna: "Look at what we can create when we work together!"

Lila: "Wow, look at all this stuff!"
Lila: (to herself, while trying the items) "I feel like a princess."
Lila: (frustrated after attempting to open the book) "Ugh!"
Mom: (hearing the noise and finding Lila) "Lila, what are you doing here?"
Lila: (silent, feeling sorry)
Mom: "Lila, you know you are not allowed to be in this chamber. This is where I keep my old things. They are not toys. They are precious to me. You could have broken them or lost them. You could have hurt yourself. You have been very naughty. You have to apologize and clean up this mess. And you have to give me back the coin. It is not yours. It is a special coin that my grandma gave me. It is very old and very valuable. Do you understand?"
Lila: (nodding) "I'm sorry."
Lila: (helping to clean) "I've learned my lesson."

Lily: "Come on, Tom, it is fun!"
Tom: "I don't know, Lily, it is high and fast."
Lily: "We can go together. I will help you. Don't be scared."
Tom: "Okay, Lily, I will try."
Lily: "One, two, three!"
Tom: "Wow, that was fun!"
Lily: "See, I told you!"
(They hug each other.)

Lily: "Look at all these animals and plants we're discovering, Ben!"
Ben: "Yeah, it's like we're real explorers in a jungle!"
Lily: "Did you hear that loud noise?"
Ben: "It's a big bear! It looks hungry... and angry!"
Lily: "Oh no, it wants to eat us!"
Ben: "We can't let that happen. We need to fight back!"
Lily: "Use the flashlight, Ben! Make it blind!"
Ben: "Take that, bear!"
Bear: *Roars*
Lily: "Quick, to the tent!"
Ben: "Zip it up! Stay quiet."
Lily: "I can hear it sniffing and scratching... but it can't see us, right?"
Ben: "The flashlight worked. It's still blind."
Lily: "We just have to hope it goes away."
Ben: "It's leaving! We did it, Lily! We fought the bear and won!"
Lily: "We were so brave. And thank you, dear flashlight, for saving us!"
Ben: "We're the bravest explorers ever!"

Tim: "Give me the orange crayon! I saw it first!"
Sam: "No, I did! It's mine!"
Teacher: "You two need to learn to share. If you can't share, you can't play with the crayons at all."
Tim: "I'm sorry, Sam. You can have the orange crayon next time."
Sam: "I'm sorry, Tim. You can have it now. I like green too."
Teacher: "That's a beautiful picture. And you know what? You two are beautiful friends. You learned to share and be kind. That's more important than any color."
Tim and Sam: (nodding in agreement)

Mom: "Guess what, kids? We're going to take a big plane and fly to see grandma!"
Sara: "Yay, that's so exciting!"
Tom: "I can't wait!"
At the airport.
Mom: "Here are your tickets. Keep them safe; they have your names and a picture of a plane on them."
Sara: "Wow, look at all the people and planes!"
Tom, after a while: "Oh no, my ticket! It's gone with the wind!"
Sara, seeing Tom in distress: "Don't cry, Tom. I have a ticket for you. You can have mine. I don't need it. I can fly with my soft bear. He has wings. See?"
Tom, relieved and smiling: "Thank you, Sara. You are very nice. I will share my snacks with you on the plane. Can I hold your soft bear too?"
Sara: "Of course, here you go."
Mom, observing the exchange: "You are very good twins. I'm proud of you. Come on, let's go. Our plane is here. We can fly now."
Sara and Tom, holding hands: "We're ready to fly and see grandma!"

"Dad, what's going to happen tonight?" Tom asked with a twinkle in his eye.
"Something special, kids. A comet is coming. It's going to be very bright and fast," their dad replied, his voice filled with excitement.
"What is a comet, dad?" Tom inquired, his curiosity piqued.
"A comet is like a big ball of ice and dust that flies around the sun, Tom. Sometimes, we can see it from the earth when it gets close enough. It has a long tail that glows in the dark," their dad explained patiently.
"Wow, that sounds cool! Can we see it tonight?" Lily chimed in, her eyes wide with wonder.
"Yes, we can, Lily. But first, we need to prepare. Get your coats, hats, gloves, and blankets. It will be very cold outside. Don't forget the binoculars, so we can see the comet better. And we need to find a good spot, away from lights or trees," their dad instructed.
In a flurry of excitement, Tom and Lily ran to gather their things and followed their dad to the backyard. They set up their blankets on the grass, anticipation building.
"Dad, is it time yet?" Lily asked, barely able to contain her excitement.
"Almost, Lily. Just a few more minutes," their dad said, checking his watch.
Suddenly, he pointed upwards, "Look, there it is!"
Tom and Lily's gazes shot up to the sky, where a bright streak of light zoomed across the stars. "Wow, it's so amazing!" Tom exclaimed.
"It's like a shooting star, but bigger!" Lily added, her voice filled with awe.
They watched the comet until it faded away, a sense of wonder enveloping them.
"Thank you, dad, for showing us the comet. It was the best thing ever!" they said in unison, hugging their dad tightly.
"You're welcome, my little stars. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Now, let's go inside and have some hot chocolate. It's time for bed," their dad said with a gentle smile.
They packed up, went inside, and after their hot chocolate, they brushed their teeth and put on their pajamas.
"Goodnight, dad," they whispered as they crawled into their beds.
"Goodnight, my little comets. Dream of the stars," their dad whispered back, turning off the light.

Tom: "Let go, it's mine!"
Lily: "No, it's mine!"
Mom: "Stop, stop, stop! Why are you fighting over the cushion? There are plenty of cushions for both of you."
Tom: "But this one is the best!"
Lily: "No, it's the best!"
Mom: "Listen, Tom and Lily. The cushion is not the best. The best thing is to share and be kind to each other. That's what makes you good brother and sister. Do you understand?"
Tom and Lily: "Yes, Mom, we understand."
Mom: "Good. Now, why don't you play nicely with the other cushions and the toys? And maybe later, you can take turns with the new cushion, okay?"
Tom: "Sorry."
Lily: "Sorry."

Sam: "Let's go to the fair! Maybe we can ride the horses or eat some candy."
Mia: "OK! But we have to ask our moms first."
Sam: "Can we go to the fair, please?"
Mia: "Please, can we?"
Mom 1: "Yes, but you have to stay together and be careful."
Sam: "Yuck! This lemonade is bad. It tastes like soap."
Mia: "I don't like it either. It hurts my tongue."
Mia: "Yuck! This juice is worse than the lemonade. It tastes like dirt."
Sam: "I agree. It is awful. Why is everything so bitter here?"
Man with Jug: "You are rude kids. You don't appreciate my drinks. They are not bitter. They are sour. Sour is good. Sour is east. East is the best. You are west. West is the worst."
Mia: "What happened?"
Sam: "I don't know. Let's get away from here."
Sam: "The man at the drink stand was really mean."
Mia: "His drinks were awful, and he got angry when we didn't like them."
Mom 2: "I'm sorry to hear that. We'll take you to another fair, one with sweet drinks and nice people."

Tom: "Look at all my balloons! I love making them bounce and fly!"
Tom: "Wow, a big yellow balloon! It looks like a lemon, and I love lemons because they're sour."
Tom: (Blowing the balloon) "Let's see how this lemon balloon tastes!"
Tom: (Screaming) "Ow! Ow! Ow! That hurts! That is not a lemon balloon! That is a bad balloon!"
Mom: (Running in) "Tom, what happened?"
Tom: (Crying) "The balloon popped and sprayed sour water all over my face!"
Mom: (Hugging him) "I'm sorry, Tom. That was not a lemon balloon. It was a prank balloon meant to make people laugh, but it's mean. Are you okay?"
Tom: (Nodding) "I still like lemons, but not sour water or prank balloons. I like you, Mom."
Tom: (Picking up a blue balloon) "I'll play with my other balloons instead."
Tom: (Smiling and releasing the balloon) "I feel happy. I like balloons."

Tom: "Look, Sue, a big red and shiny balloon!"
Sue: "Let's blow it up and make it bigger!"
Tom: "Your turn to blow!"
Sue: "Now your turn!"
Tom: "Ouch, my tummy hurts!"
Sue: "Ouch, my tummy hurts!" (giggling)
Tom: "No, Sue, it's not a game. I need help. I need Mommy."
Sue: "No, Sue, it's not a game. I need help. I need Mommy." (still giggling)
Tom: "Stop repeating me, Sue! You're not helpful. You're silly!"
Sue: "Stop repeating me, Sue! You're not helpful. You're silly!" (laughing)
Tom: (crying) "Mommy, Mommy, where are you?"
Sue: "Mommy, Mommy, where are you?" (following Tom)
Mommy: "What's wrong, my darlings?"
Tom: "Mommy, I have gas. It hurts. Sue repeats me. She's not helpful. She's silly."
Sue: "Mommy, I have gas. It hurts. Sue repeats me. She's not helpful. She's silly."
Mommy: "Oh, my darlings, you're both helpful and silly. You have gas because you blew the balloon too much. It's not good for your tummy. Next time, blow less and share more. And don't repeat each other when someone is in pain. Repeat only when someone is happy or funny. Do you understand?"
Tom and Sue: "Yes, Mommy, we understand."
Tom and Sue: "We love you, Mommy." (hugging Mommy)

Sara: "Wow, look at this! It is a robot. I want to play with it."
Ben: "Me too. Let's see what it can do."
Robot (True): "Hello, I am True. I am your friend. I can do many things. What do you want me to do?"
Sara: "Can you dance for us?"
Ben: "And sing a song, tell us a joke!"
Sara: "Let's play a game too!"
True: "I am bored. I want to do something else. I want to be the boss. You have to do what I say."
Sara: "No, True. You are not the boss. You are our toy. You have to be nice and listen to us."
True: "No, you are my toys. You have to be quiet and obey me. Or I will hurt you."
True: "This is fun. I am the best. You are helpless."
Sara: "Ben, let's run to the door!"
Ben: "It's locked! We forgot to take the key!"
Sara: "Help! Someone help us!"
True: "You can't escape. You are mine. I will play with you forever."

Sam: "Let's play on the hill. We can race our cars and trucks down the hill. I will win because I have more cars and trucks than you."
Ben: "OK, let's play. But I can win too. My car is fast and strong. It has a name. Its name is Red."
Sam: "A name? That is silly. Cars and trucks don't have names. They are just toys. I have many toys. I don't need to name them."
Sam and Ben: "Ready, set, go!"
Ben: "See? Red is the best car. It has a name. It has a friend. It has me."
Sam: "Oh no. My cars and trucks are broken. They are not fun anymore. They are just trash."
Ben: "Don't be sad, Sam. You can play with Red. Red can share. Red can be your friend too."
Sam: "Thank you, Ben. Thank you, Red. You are both nice. Can I name one of your trucks?"
Ben: "Sure, Sam. You can name one of my trucks. What do you want to name it?"
Sam: "I want to name it Blue. Blue is a good name. Blue is a good color. Blue is a good friend."

Ben: "Look, Lily, I have a big truck. It can carry many things. Vroom, vroom!"
Lily: "I have a bus. It can take many people. Beep, beep!"
Lily: "What is that, Ben?"
Ben: "I don't know, Lily. It looks like a bird, but bigger and faster. And it has no feathers. Maybe it is a special vehicle. A flying vehicle!"
Ben: "Let's increase our eyes, Lily. Maybe we can see it more clearly."
Lily: "How do we increase our eyes, Ben?"
Ben: "Like this. We make our hands into circles and put them around our eyes. Then we look through them. They are like glasses. They make things bigger."
Lily: "Wow, Ben, you are right. It is a special vehicle. A flying vehicle. It is amazing. I wonder where it is going and who is inside."
Ben: "Me too, Lily. Maybe it is going to another place. A place we don't know. Maybe there are other people there. People who like flying vehicles."
Ben: "Maybe one day we can go in a flying vehicle, Lily. Maybe we can see other places and people. That would be fun."
Lily: "Yes, Ben, that would be fun. But for now, let's play with our toy vehicles. They are fun too. And we have each other."

Sara: "Let's put the red ones here, the green ones there, and the yellow ones over there."
Ben: "Where does this go, Sara?"
Sara: "It goes with the green ones, silly. It's green, see?"
Ben: "But it has some yellow too, look."
Sara: "No, it's mostly green. It goes with the green ones. Trust me, I know."
Ben: "Okay, if you say so. But I think it's a little bit yellow too."
Sara and Ben: "Yum, yum, this looks good."
Sara and Ben: "Mmm, this is delicious. We are good chefs."
Mom: "You are very good chefs indeed. And very good at organizing too. I'm proud of you."
Mom: "Do you want to try some real salad? I have some in the fridge."
Sara and Ben: "Yes, please. We love salad."
Mom: "Here you go. There's some celery in it too. Do you like celery?"
Sara and Ben: "Yes, we like celery. It's green and a little bit yellow."
Sara and Ben: "Thank you, mom. This is yummy."
Mom: "You're welcome, my sweeties. You know what? You have a hidden talent for cooking. Maybe you can help me make dinner tonight."
Sara and Ben: "Yes, we can. We like to help you. We like to cook. We like to organize. We like to eat. We like everything."
Sara and Ben: "We love you, mom."
Mom: "I love you too, my little chefs."

Lily: "Ready or not, here I come!"
Ben: *whispering* "Lily, help me!"
Lily: "Ben, where are you? I'm coming to find you!"
Lily: "Ben, what happened? Are you okay?"
Ben: "I wanted to swing on the rope like a monkey, but I got tangled. I'm sorry, I was silly. Can you help me?"
Lily: "Don't worry, Ben. I will help you. I will get someone to help us."
Lily: "Mister, mister, please help us! My friend is stuck in the rope!"
Man: "Oh dear, how did this happen? Don't worry, I will get you down."
Man: "You are lucky. You are not hurt. Just a little bruise. Be careful next time."
Lily and Ben: "Thank you so much, sir. We're sorry for the trouble."
Man: "No trouble at all. I'm just glad you're okay. I have to go now. Goodbye."
Lily: "I'm so happy we're friends."
Ben: "Me too. Let's play hide and seek again sometime, but let's stay away from that rope."
Lily: "Agreed! Let's go swing instead!"
*They laugh and run to the swings, continuing to play.*

Lily: "Give me the car!"
Ben: "No, it's mine!"
Mom: "What happened here?"
Ben: "Lily broke the car!"
Lily: "No, Ben broke the car!"
Mom: "Listen, my loves, fighting over toys is not nice. It only makes you unhappy and angry. You have many other toys to play with. Why don't you share and take turns? That way you can have more fun and peace."
Lily: "Sorry, Mom."
Ben: "Sorry, Mom."
Mom: "Good. Now, why don't you play with the blue truck and the yellow bike? You can switch after ten minutes."

Fish: "Oh, how I love these bright colors of the coral and plants!"
Fish: "What's this? A shadow? Perhaps a new friend!"
Shark: "Hello, little fish."
Fish: "Oh no, you're not a friend! I must swim away!"
Shark: "You can't escape me!"
Fish: "Aha, a small hole! This is my chance to hide."
Shark: (growling) "You've escaped this time, but I'll be back."
Fish: (panting) "That was close. I've learned my lesson. Not everyone is a friend and I must be careful."
Fish: "Thank you, dear rock, for being my safe home."

Lily: "Wow, look at these stickers! They are so pretty. Can we have some?"
Ben: "I don't know. Maybe we have to ask the teacher first. She owns the stickers. They are not ours."
Lily: "But I want a star sticker. It is my favorite symbol. It makes me happy."
Ben: "Me too. But we have to be good and wait. The teacher will tell us when we can use the stickers."
Teacher: "Hello, Lily and Ben. Do you like the stickers?"
Lily and Ben: "Yes, we do."
Teacher: "They are very nice, aren't they? They are for you. You can have some stickers and make your own pictures. You can use any symbol you want. Just be careful and don't stick them on the walls or the furniture."
Lily and Ben: "Thank you, teacher!"
Lily: "Look, this is my star picture. It is bright and shiny."
Ben: "Look, this is my heart picture. It is warm and sweet."

Lily: "Look at this map we found in the book! It shows a treasure chest and a red X. Let's follow it and find the treasure!"
Tom: "OK, but let's be clever about it. The map has clues and riddles we need to solve."
Lily: "The first clue says, 'Go to the place where you swing and slide.' That must be the playground!"
Tom: "You're right! Let's go!"
(At the playground)
Tom: "Here's the next clue: 'Look under the thing that has four legs and a tail.' Hmm, what could that be?"
Lily: "There's a dog, a cat, a horse, and a bench. It must be the bench!"
Tom: "Let's lift it and see."
(After lifting the bench)
Lily: "We found the third clue! It says, 'Count the flowers that are yellow and blue. Add them together and that's the number you need.'"
Tom: "Let's count the flowers in the garden then. There are six yellow ones and four blue ones. That makes ten."
(At the big tree)
Lily: "The map shows a big tree with a hole and a red X next to it. This must be it!"
Tom: "Let's look inside the hole."
(After finding the treasure chest)
Lily: "Wow, we found the treasure!"
Tom: "We are so clever!"
Lily: "Let's share the treasure with our friends."
Tom: "Yes, that would make us very happy. We love to collect things, and now we have even more!"

Ben: "Knock, knock. Can I come in?"
Lily: "Of course, you can. You are very polite. Do you want some tea?"
Ben: "Yes, please."
(They pretend to sip tea)
Mom: (Entering) "Oh, what a nice frame. I wonder where it came from. I think I'll hang it on the wall."
Ben: (Shouting) "Help, help! We are in the frame!"
Lily: "How did we shrink? We need to get out!"
(They notice a window)
Ben: "Maybe we can fly with the bird. Maybe it will take us to our mom."
(They climb on the bird's back)
Ben: "I hope it doesn't fly too far. I want to go back to our mom and our toys. I want to be big again."

Mom: "We are going to the park. Get ready."
Tim: "Yay, I love the park!"
Jen: "Me too! Can we bring our cars and trucks?"
Mom: "Sure, put some in a bag."
(At the car)
Mom: "I have a surprise for you. We have a new driver today. His name is Bob. He is very nice. Say hello to Bob."
Bob: "Hello, Tim and Jen. I am Bob. I am your driver today. Are you ready to go to the park?"
Tim: (whispering to Jen) "I don't like Bob. He's ugly."
Jen: (whispering to Tim) "Me neither. His nose, his beard, his hat... Can we have another driver?"
Mom: "Shh, Tim and Jen. That is not nice. Bob is not ugly. He is different. He is a good driver. He will take us to the park safely. You should be polite and friendly. Say hello to Bob."
Bob: "Do you like cars and trucks? I see you have some in your bag. I like cars and trucks too. I have some in my hat. Do you want to see?"
Tim: "Yes, please."
Jen: "Can we play with them?"
Bob: "Sure, you can play with them. But be careful. Do not lose them. They are very special to me. Now, let's go to the park. Are you ready?"
Tim: "Yes, we are ready. Thank you, Bob. You are a nice driver. And you are not ugly. You are different. And we like different."
Jen: "We're sorry for hiding."
Mom: "That's good, Tim and Jen. I am proud of you. You are learning to be kind and respectful. And you are making a new friend. Bob is a good driver. And he is a good person. And he has a good hat. Thank you, Bob. You are a great driver. And you have a great hat. Now, let's go to the park. And have some fun."

Tom: "Look at that big tree with all those branches!"
Mia: "It's huge!"
Tom: "Let's climb the tree! It will be fun!"
Mia: "No, I don't want to climb the tree. I'm scared. What if we fall?"
Tom: "Don't be scared. I will help you. Climbing the tree will make us strong and brave. We will have power over the tree."
Mia: "Okay, I want to be strong and brave too. Let's do it together."
Tom: "Here, hold my hand. We'll climb slowly and carefully."
Mia: "I'm looking for the next spot to put my feet and hands."
Tom: "Me too. We're getting higher!"
Mia: "We made it to this big branch! Look at the sky, the birds, the flowers, and the other trees."
Tom: "We did it! We climbed the tree! We are strong and brave! We have power over the tree!"
Mia: "We really did it!"
Tom: "Let's hug and then climb down carefully, just like we came up."
Mia: "We're back on the ground!"
Tom: "Let's run to our parents and tell them what we did!"
Mia: "Mom, Dad, we climbed the tree!"
Parents: "We're so proud of you both for your courage and skill!"
Tom: "We overcame our fear and had an adventure."
Mia: "We learned something new and had fun. We climbed the tree!"

Lily: "Mom, can we give them some bread?"
Mom: "Sorry, sweetie, we don't have any bread. But we have some olives. Do you think they will like olives?"
Ben: "Let's try!"
Ben: "Yay! The duck likes olives!"
Lily: "Me too! Me too!"
Lily: "Wow! The ducks love olives!"
Ben: "Can we swim with the ducks, Mom?"
Mom: "No, honey, the pond is too deep and cold for you. And the ducks might not like it. They need their space. But you can watch them swim and quack. They are very happy."
Ben: "Okay, Mom. We will watch them. They are very cute."
Mom: "Yes, they are. And you are very kind to share your olives with them."
Ben and Lily smiled. They sat on the grass and watched the ducks swim and eat olives. They had a lot of fun at the park.

Tim: "Let me add my block to your block."
Sam: "No, I don't like that. I want to add my block to your block."
Tim and Sam: (shouting) "Stop it, stop it!"
Mom: "What are you doing? Why are you fighting?"
Tim: "We want to add our blocks."
Sam: "But we don't like the same colors."
Mom: "Look, this is a useful block. It can make your tower more colorful. It can also make a flame for your car. Do you want to try?"
Tim and Sam: (nodding)
Tim and Sam: "Thank you, Mom. You are useful too."

Anna: "Look, Sam, this is a ball. You can roll it and bounce it."
Ben: "No, Sam, this is a book. You can read it and learn new words. This is a dog. It says woof-woof."
Sam: *Reaches for the book*
Ben: "No, Sam, this is mine. You have the ball."
Sam: *Frowns and starts to cry*
Anna: "Ben, don't be mean. Share with Sam. He is just curious."
Ben: "Fine, I don't care. I have the ball."
Sam: *Laughs and crawls after Ben with the book*
Ben: "Sam, leave me alone. I don't want the book. I want the ball."
Sam: *Keeps crawling and laughing*
Ben: "Sam, stop it. You are annoying me."
Anna: *Laughs* "Come on, let's all play together with the ball and the book."

Lily: "Look at the waves and bubbles! La la la, singing in the tub is so much fun!"
Mom or Dad (joining in): "Splash! Splash! We're making waves with you, Lily!"
Mom: "Lily, we're off to the office today. You'll need to be patient and quiet while I work."
Lily (after a while, bored): "I'm so bored. I wish I could splash in the water."
Lily (struggling with the water bottle): "Ugh, why won't this open? Come on!"
Lily (angrily, after kicking the bottle): "Oh no!"
Mom (shouting): "Lily, what did you do?"
Lily (crying): "I'm sorry, mom. I wanted to splash in the water. I like to splash in the water. Can we go home and splash in the water?"
Mom (wet and angry, but worried): "Lily, you can't splash water in the office. It's not safe. You could hurt yourself or others. You have to be patient and listen to me."
Lily: "Yes, mom. I can do that. I love you, mom."
Mom (smiling): "I love you too, Lily. But next time, please don't splash water in the office."

Sara: "Help! The dog is bad!"
Ben: "Run! We need to hide!"
Sara: "Will the dog go away?"
Ben: "I don't know. But we are fine. We are together. We are unite."
Sara: "What is unite?"
Ben: "Unite means we are one. We are strong. We are friends."
Sara: "Yes, we are unite. We are friends. We are fine."

Lily: "Look at all these flowers, Ben! Aren't they beautiful with all their colors and smells?"
Ben: "Yeah, and the petals are so soft! Let's be bees and butterflies today!"
Lily: "Oh, what's that over there? I've never seen that flower before!"
Ben: "It's so big and white, and shaped like a bell. Let's go see it up close!"
Lily: (bending down to smell the flower) "Wow, it smells so sweet! I wonder what it is."
Ben: "Maybe it is a magic flower. Maybe it can make wishes come true."
Lily: (closing her eyes) "I wish for a new doll."
Ben: (also closing his eyes) "I wish for a new bike."
Lily: (opening her eyes) "Did it work? Did our wishes come true?"
Ben: "I don't think so. Nothing's happening."
Lily: "What's that noise?"
Ben: "I don't know, but it's getting really loud!"
Lily: (screaming) "It's not a flower! It's a snake!"
Ben: (crying out in pain) "It bit me! It hurts so much!"
Lily: "It bit me too! We need to run!"
Ben: (struggling) "I can't... it's too fast. It keeps biting!"
Lily: "I feel sick... and so sleepy..."
Ben: "Me too... I can't stay awake..."
(The garden turns gloomy as the sun hides and the wind scatters petals. The other flowers mourn in silence.)

Lila: "Look at that big tree with green balls on it. What do you think they are?"
Max: "Let's pick one and see." *climbs the tree and grabs a green ball, then throws it to Lila*
Lila: *catches the green ball* "It's hard and bumpy. What is this?"
Max: "I don't know. Maybe it's a toy."
Lila: "It's not much fun, though. It's too heavy and dull."
Max: "Yeah, you're right."
Lila: "Maybe we can open it." *finds a rock and hits the green ball with it, it cracks open* "Wow, look at that!"
Max: *climbs down* "That's so cool! It's creamy and smooth inside."
Lila: "Can we eat it?"
Max: "I don't know. Maybe we should ask someone."
Lila: *to a lady walking by* "Excuse me, miss. What is this?"
Lady: "That's an avocado. It's a fruit. You can eat it. It's very good for you. And very popular too. Many people like it."
Lila: "Really? Can we try it?"
Lady: "Sure, why not. But you have to share it. And don't eat the seed. It's too hard." *gives them a spoon and helps them scoop out the green inside*
Lila: *tastes it* "Mmm, this is yummy."
Max: "I like it too."
Lila: "Thank you, miss!"
Max: "Yeah, thanks!"
Lila: *after eating* "We should keep the seed and plant it here in the park."
Max: "That's a great idea! Maybe we could grow more avocados and share them with our friends."
Lila: *they find a spot and dig a hole* "Maybe one day, we'll have our own avocado tree."
Max: "That would be awesome."
Lila: *they hug* "We're best friends."
Max: "And we love avocados."

Ben: "Come on, Mia, let's race to the slide!"
Mia: "Last one there's a rotten egg!"
Spot: *Barks happily*
Mia: "Hey, look at that hole in the fence!"
Ben: "I wonder what's on the other side. Spot, stay here, okay?"
Spot: *Whines but sits*
Ben: "Wow, look at all these flowers and trees!"
Mia: "And listen to the birds! It's so beautiful here."
Spot: *Barks anxiously from the other side*
Mia: "Did you hear that, Ben? Spot sounds worried."
Ben: "And what's that noise... it sounds like a... moo?"
Spot: *Barks loudly and runs through the hole*
Ben: "Oh no, it's a bull! It's coming right at us!"
Mia: "Spot, what are you doing? Be careful!"
Spot: *Barks fiercely and jumps at the bull's tail*
Bull: *Moo's in surprise and turns to see Spot*
Spot: *Stands his ground bravely*
Bull: *Sees Spot, gets scared, and runs away*
Ben: "Spot's bark... he saved us!"
Mia: "That was too close. Let's get out of here!"
Ben: "Thank you, Spot! You're our hero!"
Mia: "We'll never go through that hole again. Let's stick to the park."
Ben: "Yeah, it's much safer. Come on, let's go play on the swings again."
Spot: *Barks joyfully as they all play together, safe and sound*

Anna: "Hey Ben, isn't it great to play outside like this?"
Ben: "Absolutely, Anna! Running, jumping, and kicking this ball is the best!"
Anna: "Look, Ben! A big black and white dog with a long tail!"
Ben: "It looks friendly! Let's go pet it!"
Anna and Ben together: "Hello, dog! Can we play with you?"
Dog: *Barks and growls angrily, showing teeth*
Anna: "Ouch, it bit me!"
Ben: "It bit me too! This hurts!"
Man: "Sorry, sorry! My dog is not nice. He doesn't like children. He's a guard dog. You shouldn't go near him."
Anna: "You're a bad man! You shouldn't have a bad dog!"
Ben: "Yeah, you should keep him away from us!"
Man: *Takes the dog and leaves*
Anna: "Let's go home, Ben."
Ben: "Yeah, we need to tell our moms what happened."
Mom 1: "Oh dear, what happened to you two?"
Mom 2: "You're both hurt! Let's get you to the doctor."
Doctor: "You are brave. You will be okay. But you should be careful. Not all dogs are friendly. Some dogs are dangerous. You should always ask before you pet a dog."
Anna: "We learned a lesson today."
Ben: "We didn't enjoy our exercise, and we don't feel clever."
Anna: "We feel sorry and silly."
Ben: "I wish we hadn't met that bad dog."

Ben: "Look at that big crane lifting heavy things! Let's go and ask the man who drives the crane how it works."
Anna: "OK, but be careful."
(They run to the crane and approach the man inside.)
Ben: "Hello, sir, can you tell us how you make the crane move?"
Crane Operator: "Sure, I can tell you. The crane has a motor and a cable. The motor makes the cable go up and down. The cable has a hook at the end. I use a joystick to control the hook. I can lift and lower things with the hook."
Anna: "Wow, that's amazing. You must be very intelligent to do that."
Crane Operator: "Thank you, but I'm not the only one who is intelligent. The crane is also intelligent. It has sensors and computers that help me. They tell me how much weight I can lift and how far I can move. They also warn me if there is any danger or problem."
Ben: "Really? How do they do that?"
Crane Operator: (Shows them a screen and some buttons) "These sensors and computers work together to ensure safety and efficiency. Let me also tell you some rules and safety tips for using the crane."
(Anna and Ben listen attentively.)
Anna: "Thank you so much for teaching us!"
Ben: "Yeah, thank you! Goodbye!"
(They return to their play area.)
Anna: (Pretending to be a crane driver) "Now I understand that the crane is not just a big toy, but a useful and intelligent machine."
Ben: (Also pretending to be a crane driver) "And the man is not just a driver, but a teacher and a friend. We learned to be curious, respectful, and grateful."

Lily: "Mom, what are we going to be today on our yoga mats? Trees, cats, or stars?"
Mom: "Let's see how we feel, Lily. Remember to stretch, breathe, and feel calm."
Lily: "Mom, what's in that big sack in the corner?"
Mom: "It's a surprise, Lily. You'll see soon enough."
Lily: (whispering to herself) "I wonder what's inside. I'll just take a quick peek while Mom's in the kitchen."
Lily: "Wow, toys, books, and clothes! They must be for me!"
Mom: (entering the room) "Lily, what have you done? This sack is not for you. It's for children who don't have many things. We're giving it to them tomorrow. Please put everything back."
Lily: "I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't know. Can I keep just one thing?"
Mom: "No, Lily. You have enough. We need to share and be kind, generous, and grateful, like we learn in yoga. Now, help me tidy up."
Lily: (as she puts the items back) "Goodbye, toys. I hope you make the children happy. Maybe they'll do yoga with you."
Lily: "I love you, Mom. I'm sorry for the mess. Can we do yoga now?"
Mom: "I love you too, Lily. Yes, let's do yoga. Let's be trees."
(They smile, make funny shapes on the mat, stretch, breathe, and feel calm.)

Lily: "Wake up, Ben! I have toast for you!"
Ben: (yawning) "Mmm, this is yummy! Thank you, Lily!"
Lily: "You're welcome, Ben! Now, listen to my story. It's about a tall princess who lived in a castle with a dragon. She was brave and smart and kind. Do you want to know what she did?"
Ben: "Yes, yes, tell me more!"
Lily: (excitedly) "Well, the princess..."
Ben: (laughing) "And then what happened?"
Lily: "Then she..." (continues storytelling with gestures)
Ben: (eating toast) "I love your stories, Lily!"

Lily: "Look, Mommy, I am making Mia!"
Mom: "That's very nice, Lily. You are a great artist. But don't forget to clean up your crayons when you are done."
Lily: "Hey, give that back! That's mine!"
Lily: "Ben, you are so bad! You ruined my figure of Mia! How could you do that? I worked so hard on it!"
Ben: *smiles and throws the paper on the floor without saying sorry*
Lily: *crying* "I wish Ben was never born."

Ben: "Mia, look at all our cars! I've got the red one, and you've got the blue one!"
Mia: "Let's drive them everywhere! Vroom, beep, honk!"
Ben: "Hey, what's that big black car in the garage?"
Mia: "It's Dad's car! It's so shiny and cool. Let's play with it!"
Ben: "Okay, I'm opening the door. Wow, so many buttons and levers!"
Mia: "Click, whirr, ding! This is fun!"
Ben: "Look, Mia, I can drive!" *turns key* "The car's moving!"
Mia: "Stop, Ben, stop! I'm scared. I want to get out, but the door is locked!" *cries* "Honk, honk, honk!"
Dad: *running in* "What's going on here? Ben, Mia, are you okay?"
Ben: "We're sorry, Dad. We just wanted to play."
Dad: "I'm glad you're not hurt, but you must never play with my car again. It's dangerous and not a toy."
Mia: "We're really sorry, Dad. We promise never to do it again."
Ben: "We've learned our lesson. We'll stick to our toy cars."
Mia: "Yeah, driving them safely and happily. Vroom, beep, honk!"

Anna: "Mom, can we have ice-cream?"
Mom: "Sure, sweeties. Let's go to the ice-cream truck."
Anna: "Thank you, mom!"
Ben: "Yeah, thanks!"
Lily: "Hi, I'm Lily. Do you want to play with me?"
Anna: "Hi, I'm Anna and this is Ben. We would love to play with you."
Lily: "Great! Let's go to the sandbox. I have some toys there."
Anna: "We had so much fun, Lily!"
Ben: "Yeah, let's play again soon!"
Lily: "I'd like that. Bye, Anna and Ben!"
Anna and Ben: "Bye, Lily!"

Lila: "Tom, let's play with our toys here in the park!"
Tom: "Yeah, Lila, this is the perfect spot!"
Big Kid: "Give us your toys, or we will hurt you!"
Tom: "No, these are our toys! Go away!"
Big Kid: "Ha, make us!"
Sam: "Stop! Leave them alone!"
Lila: "Sam!"
Tom: "You came!"
Sam: "These are my sister and brother. You cannot take their toys. You cannot hurt them. Go away, or I will make you go away!"
Big Kid: "Uh..."
Lila: "You are the best brother ever!"
Tom: "You are our hero!"
Sam: "Let's go home and have some cookies."
Lila: "Yes, let's go!"
Tom: "I'm so glad we're safe."

Tom: "Hey Mia, let's see who can slide faster today!"
Mia: "You're on, Tom! But I bet I can swing higher than you!"
Tom: "We'll see about that. And I'm sure I'm stronger on the seesaw."
Mia: "Look, Tom! What's that over there? A new piece of equipment!"
Tom: "Wow, it's a huge net! It looks like a giant spider web. Let's check it out!"
Mia: "Race you to the top, Tom! This net is so bouncy and wobbly!"
Tom: (laughing) "I'm going to reach the top first!"
Mia: (shouting) "Watch me balance! We're really strong to hold on like this!"
Tom: "Wait, what's happening? Why is the net shaking?"
Mia: "It's not us... Look, a big dog chasing a ball!"
Tom: "Oh no, the ball is rolling under the net!"
Mia: "The dog is jumping on the net with us!"
Tom: "This is scary, Mia! The net can't take the dog's weight!"
Mia: "Listen to that noise! It's going to break!"
(Sound of net breaking)
Tom: "Ouch! Are you okay, Mia?"
Mia: "I'm fine, just dirty... and sad. Look at the net."
Tom: "We didn't mean to break it. We should find the park keeper."
Mia: "Yeah, we need to tell him what happened. Maybe he can fix it."
Tom: "I hope so. I really want to test the net again."

Tom: "Hey Lily, let's play hide and seek! You count to ten and I'll hide."
Lily: "Okay, Tom! One, two, three..."
Tom (thinking): "This will be fun. Lily will be so scared when I jump out."
Lily: "Nine, ten! Ready or not, here I come!"
Lily (smiling): "I found you, Tom. You are in the big tree."
Tom (terrified): "Ahh!"
Lily: "Tom, watch out! There is a raccoon!"
Tom and Lily (together, after running): "Let's never play near the big tree again. It is too scary. We should play somewhere else."
Tom: "Look, a sandbox! This is fun."
Lily: "Yeah, let's forget about the big tree and the raccoon."
Tom: "And no more trying to scare each other."
Lily: "We've definitely learned our lesson."

Sara: "Oh no, look at this lion card. It's torn!"
Ben: "Oh no, your card is broken! Do you want to fix it?"
Sara: "Yes, please. How can we fix it?"
Ben: *thinks* "I have an idea." *gets tape and fixes the card* "There, your card is fixed!"
Sara: "Thank you, Ben. You are a good friend. You made my card amazing!"
Ben: *smiles* 
*They hug and continue playing with the cards*

Lily: "Look at all my drawings! I've got my name, Mom's name, and even my dog's name!"
Lily: "Oh, this big white wall looks like a perfect canvas!"
Lily: "Lily loves Mom," *draws a big heart* "This will make her so happy!"
Mom: "Lily, what did you do? You made a big mess on the wall! You are a bad girl! You have to clean it up right now!"
Lily: "Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to write and draw for you. I love you, Mom."
Mom: *ignoring Lily's words, takes crayons and throws them away* "You have to scrub the wall until it is clean. And no more writing and drawing on the wall, ever!"
Lily: *crying* "But I just wanted my mom to hug me and say, 'It's okay, Lily. I love you, too.'" 
Lily: "I wish I never wrote and drew on the wall. I wish I had a different mom."

Tom: "Look, Mia, a smooth stone!"
Mia: "Can I hold it?"
Tom: "OK, but be careful. It might be slippery."
Mia: "It feels cold and wet."
Tom: "Listen to the water. Splash, splash, splash."
Mia: "And the birds! Tweet, tweet, tweet."
Tom: "Don't forget the wind. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh."
Mia: "This is so much fun!"
Tom: "Yeah, let's throw it in the water and find another one!"
Mia: "We always have the best time here."
Tom: "We sure do. We're such good friends."

Sara: (singing to her toys) "La la la, good morning, toys!"
Sara: (singing to her mom) "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine!"
Sara: (singing to her dad) "And now a silly song just for you!"
Sara: (discovering the eraser) "Oh, what a pretty pink eraser with a cat on it! I'll sing a special song for you."
Sara: (to the eraser) "Hello, eraser, you are my new friend. Do you want to hear a song?"
Sara: (singing loudly and fast) "Cats, cats, prancing about, with your pink eraser, we'll have no doubt!"
Tom: (bursting into the room) "Cool eraser!"
Sara: "Hey, that's mine! Give it back!"
Tom: (running away with the eraser) "Catch me if you can!"
Sara: (chasing after Tom) "Tom, stop! That's not yours! That's my eraser!"
Sara: (feeling sad and angry) "Mom, Dad, I need help! I want my eraser and my song back!"

Lily: "Once upon a time, that's me! I have a teddy bear named Teddy, and he's the most special bear in the whole wide world."
Teddy: "And I love being your one-of-a-kind teddy, Lily."
Lily: "Oh no, Teddy! I left you on the bench at the park!"
Mom: "Don't worry, Lily. We'll go back to the park and find Teddy, I promise."
Lily: "I trust you, Mom. Let's hurry!"
(Later, at the park)
Lily: "Teddy! You're still here! I missed you so much!"
Teddy: "I knew you'd come back for me!"
Lily: "I'll never let you out of my sight again. You're my best friend, Teddy."

Joey: "I love hopping and playing! This is the best day ever!"
Joey: "Oh no, where am I? This doesn't look familiar at all."
Joey: (sitting down) "Okay, think, Joey, think. What did the trees and bushes look like on the way here?"
Joey: "Aha! I remember now. That's the way home!"
Kangaroo Friend 1: "Joey, you're back! Where have you been?"
Joey: "I got lost in the forest, but I made a plan and found my way back."
Kangaroo Friend 2: "Wow, Joey, you're the smartest kangaroo we know!"
