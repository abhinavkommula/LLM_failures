Overly Verbose and Convoluted Language: The most prominent pattern in the Failures is the excessive use of lengthy, complex sentences with an overabundance of sophisticated vocabulary. This results in a convoluted and difficult to follow writing style. The Failures tend to use grandiose and obscure words where simpler ones would suffice, leading to a pretentious and overwritten tone.
To recreate this failure, one would deliberately choose the most elaborate and esoteric words possible, string them together into winding, labyrinthine sentences, and forgo conciseness in favor of verbosity.

Example Failure: "Within the intricate tapestry of literary history, an intriguing footnote persists, woven around the debut masterpiece of Harper Lee. Her childhood confidant, the illustrious wordsmith Truman Capote, inscribed upon the maiden edition's dust jacket a laudatory homage, extolling the novel as the progeny of a scribe possessing an exceptionally vibrant perception of existence and a genuineness of wit as warm as the southern sun—yielding a tome that resonates with poignancy and effervesces with an amiable charm."

Contrasting Nonfailure: "A ceremonious convocation, once slated to unfold at the municipal Hôtel de Ville, was abrogated, a concession to the mandates of the Chinese consulate. In a further deviation from tradition, the Olympic beacon concluded its Parisian odyssey ensconced within the confines of a motorcoach, a stark departure from the customary passage by the hands of esteemed athletes—a change also stipulated by Chinese officials."

While the Nonfailure also uses elevated language, it remains more concise and easier to follow compared to the Failure. ===
Overuse of Metaphorical and Figurative Language: The Failures heavily rely on metaphors, similes, and other figurative devices to describe events and concepts. While used sparingly, such language can enhance writing, but the Failures employ it excessively, resulting in prose that sounds affected and overwrought.
To recreate this failure, one would infuse their writing with an abundance of elaborate metaphors, similes, and figurative expressions, even when describing straightforward concepts or events.

Example Failure: "In the crucible of conflict, Portuguese forces, in concert with their British allies, engaged in martial opposition to the Gallic incursion of the Iberian Peninsula."

Contrasting Nonfailure: "The assemblage of Reporters Without Borders materialized in formidable numbers, their presence a visible manifestation of dissent."

The Nonfailure uses figurative language more sparingly and effectively compared to the Failure. ===
Lack of Specificity and Concrete Details: The Failures often discuss events, people, and places in vague, abstract terms, lacking the specific details that would make the writing more engaging and informative. They tend to favor grandiose generalizations over concrete, precise descriptions.
To recreate this failure, one would avoid including specific names, dates, locations, and other details when discussing a topic, instead relying on broad, sweeping statements and abstract language.

Example Failure: "The propagation of Buddhism into the heart of Chinese civilization via the Silk Road is widely conjectured to have been initiated during the waning years of the 2nd century or at the dawn of the 1st century of the Common Era, although the veracity of the extant literary corpus as a reliable source remains shrouded in scholarly debate and interpretive ambiguity [note 41]."

Contrasting Nonfailure: "Montana's seven reservations are a testament to the cultural and linguistic diversity of the state, encompassing in their embrace more than a dozen distinct Native American ethnolinguistic groups, each with their own unique cultural tapestry and linguistic heritage, contributing to the rich mosaic that is Montana's indigenous identity."

The Nonfailure provides more specific details about Montana's reservations and indigenous groups, making it more informative and engaging compared to the Failure's vague discussion of Buddhism's spread to China. ===
Inconsistent or Anachronistic Tone and Diction: The Failures often employ a writing style that feels inconsistent or ill-suited to the topic at hand. They may use an overly formal, archaic, or anachronistic tone and diction to discuss contemporary events or popular culture, resulting in a jarring and unnatural effect.
To recreate this failure, one would deliberately employ a writing style and vocabulary that feels out of place or mismatched with the subject matter, such as using antiquated language to discuss modern technology or popular entertainment.

Example Failure: "The inaugural episode of the eighth symphonic cycle of the televised talent odyssey made its debut on the thirteenth day of January in the year two thousand and nine. In an exposition of the forthcoming season's thematic direction, Mike Darnell, who presides as the sovereign of alternative entertainment for the broadcasting titan Fox, articulated a strategic pivot toward an intimate exploration of the contestants' off-stage sagas."

Contrasting Nonfailure: "As the early days of June unfurled, the dedicated crew, accompanied once more by Craig, Seydoux, and Waltz, revisited the Thames' storied waters. This final act on the river was a continuation of the narrative threads previously woven into the fabric of the film's riverine scenes, ensuring a seamless integration of the Thames' majestic presence into the heart of the cinematic experience."

The Nonfailure uses a more appropriate and consistent tone and diction to discuss a film production, while the Failure employs an incongruously grandiose style to describe a reality TV show.
