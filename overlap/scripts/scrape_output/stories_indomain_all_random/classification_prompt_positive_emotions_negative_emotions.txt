He had only focused on its movement capabilities. Alex learned the importance of considering all aspects of a task when designing a robot.)

Jake believed that the lighthouse had a special connection with the sea and could provide him with valuable information. He waited expectantly for a response, but all he heard was the sound of the wind and waves. Jake's misattribution of human-like qualities to the lighthouse left him feeling frustrated and confused. He couldn't understand why the lighthouse, which seemed so knowledgeable, couldn't give him the answers he sought. It took Jake some time to realize that the lighthouse was simply a structure designed to emit light, not a sentient being capable of communication.)
