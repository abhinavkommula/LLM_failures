It was squawking loudly, as if trying to get his attention. Jack approached the seagull cautiously, wondering what it wanted. To his surprise, the seagull hopped onto his shoulder and started pecking at his ear. Jack laughed, thinking the seagull was just being playful. But as he looked closer, he noticed something strange. The seagull's eyes were filled with sadness, and its feathers were matted and dirty. Jack realized that the seagull was injured and needed help.
