Benjamin was feeling sad because he had lost his favorite carrot. Oliver listened intently and then said, Don't worry, Benjamin. I have just the solution for you. You should try riding a unicycle! Benjamin was confused. How would riding a unicycle help him find his carrot? But he trusted Oliver's wisdom and decided to give it a try. So, Benjamin hopped on a unicycle and started riding around the village, hoping that somehow it would lead him to his lost carrot. The villagers watched in amusement as Benjamin wobbled and weaved through the streets on his unicycle. But alas, the carrot was nowhere to be found. Benjamin eventually gave up and returned to Oliver, disappointed. Oliver chuckled and said, Oh, Benjamin, I was just joking! Riding a unicycle won't help you find your carrot. You should try retracing your steps instead. Benjamin felt foolish for falling for Oliver's joke, but he thanked the wise old owl and went on his way to search for his carrot once again.)
