Jonathan Papelbon, closer for the Washington Nationals, learned that Monday after attacking star outfielder Bryce Harper the day before in a dispute over Harper's playing style, the Washington Post reports. "I was upset," manager Matt Williams told the AP after seeing video of the altercation. "I was appalled." Indeed, Papelbon received a four-game suspension for the assault, and decided not to appeal a three-game Major League Baseball suspension for plunking a Baltimore Orioles player last week, which leaves Papelbon out for the season. The issue? Harper had flied out to left in the eighth inning and merely trotted over to first base. As Harper returned to the dugout, Papelbon angrily told him to "run it out," and Harper retorted with "let's [expletive] go." So the 34-year-old closer clutched the 22-year-old's neck and shoved him against the wall, until several Nats coaches and players pulled them apart, ESPN reports. For the record, Papelbon did apologize: "Yeah, he apologized. So, you know, whatever," says Harper, per the New York Times. "It’s like brothers fighting. That’s what happens." It's a sad note for a talented team that was widely expected to win the World Series when the season began. They were eliminated from contention on Saturday.

The alarm-clock app Sleep Cycle gathered stats on one million users across 50 nations over nine months, and found that women aged 16 to 55 are getting more sleep than men, QZ.com reports. But in most countries (Ukraine, Portugal, and Colombia excepted) they self-report worse morning moods than do men. Why the grumpiness? Well, it echoes earlier Duke University research that women need more sleep, and will suffer mentally and physically without it, as Australia's News Network reported in 2013. "We found that women had more depression, women had more anger, and women had more hostility early in the morning," said sleep expert Michael Breus at the time. Breus' solution: Take naps of 25 or 90 minutes to rejuvenate the mind. "The more of your brain you use during the day, the more of it that needs to recover and, consequently, the more sleep you need," said another sleep expert. "Women tend to multi-task ... and so they use more of their actual brain than men do." A few years back, Arianna Huffington co-wrote a blog calling sleep "the next feminist issue" because overworked women are sleep-deprived. Indeed, the Duke research indicates that women's lack of sleep is more likely to cause serious health problems including depression, stroke, and heart disease. According to Sleep Cycle, Japanese women sleep the least (5 hours, 56 minutes) while Fins, the Dutch, and New Zealanders get the most (7 hours, 41 minutes), and American women average just over 7 hours.

Cain thinks he knows: one of his former political advisers who now works for Rick Perry. Cain tells Forbes that he briefed Curt Anderson about the allegations in 2003 when Cain was in the midst of an unsuccessful run for Senate. Anderson denied it: “I never heard about this story until I read about it in Politico," he said. "I have nothing but good things to say about Herman Cain." A spokesman for the Perry camp also denied the charge and instead suggested that it might be the work of, you guessed it, Mitt Romney, notes the Hill. “By the way, there are real ties between Romney campaign backers and Mr. Cain and the National Restaurant Association,” said Ray Sullivan. (The Romney camp has previously denied planting the story.) In his Forbes interview, Cain said he told Anderson about the "baseless" charges in case his political foes raised it. "I told my wife about this in 1999 and I’ve got nothing to hide,” he added. Click to read about a third woman who has complained about Cain's behavior in the 1990s.

"I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents," Trump tweeted Friday morning. "I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!" The tweet follows an interview with Fox News in which Trump made a similar point, reports CNN. "Why didn't somebody call the FBI 36 years ago?" Trump asked in the Fox interview. "I mean you could also say when did this all happen, what's going on? To take a man like this and besmirch—now with that being said, let her have her say and let's see how it all works out." In another tweet Friday, Trump described Kavanaugh as a "fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don’t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay." As things stand now, Kavanaugh is expected to testify Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Ford is negotiating to appear later in the week, perhaps Thursday.

The former fugitive mouthed "hello" and nodded. The reunion of sorts has led to a spate of stories along the tale-of-two-brothers vein, exploring how the Boston natives rose to power in their chosen fields. See the Boston Globe and AP. “You’ve got to understand something," said one of William's friends. “We’re South Boston people, and when you grow up in Southie, the cardinal virtue is loyalty. ... And you think he wouldn’t be there today?" William eventually became president of the University of Massachusetts but resigned in 2003 amid pressure from Gov. Mitt Romney and others over what the Globe describes as his "cavalier" attitude toward his brother. "It’s my hope that I’m never helpful to anyone against him," he once told a grand jury. "I don’t feel an obligation to help everyone to catch him."

In a Twitter post Sunday night, the former Fox News host wrote that she was "surprised and saddened beyond words" by Mund's letter on Friday complaining of how she has been treated during her nearly one-year reign as Miss America. In her letter, Mund wrote that she has been bullied, manipulated, and silenced by the pageant's current top leadership, headed by Carlson and CEO Regina Hopper. Both have denied bullying Mund and say they support her; Carlson says she has reached out to Mund, but that Mund only wants to communicate with her via email. "Actions have consequences," Carlson wrote, addressing herself directly to Mund. "Friday, as an organization, we learned that $75,000 in scholarships which would have been the first scholarship increase in years is no longer on the table as a direct result of the explosive allegations in your letter." Carlson continued, "The impact won't stop there. We are already seeing a negative ripple effect across the entire organization, and I am so concerned that it will dilute the experience for the next woman selected to wear the crown." Carlson didn't specify how the scholarship money was lost, reports the AP: by sponsors backing out, donors canceling promises to contribute, or some other cause.

Stone had "self-inflicted cutting wounds to the center of his body," and police found a knife nearby. He apparently committed suicide after yesterday's rampage in which he killed former wife Nicole Stone along with her mother, grandmother, sister, brother-in-law, and niece. The only survivor is a 17-year-old nephew who was seriously wounded. Victims were shot and slashed with a knife. Stone reportedly recorded a video on a phone found either on him or nearby, but police did not reveal its contents. Stone had been in a bitter custody dispute with his wife over their two daughters. He dropped the two girls off unharmed at a neighbor's house after shooting their mother, authorities say. Stone is a former Marine, and a neighbor tells the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was a "great guy and an excellent father" in the early years of the marriage. "And then he went away to Iraq and came back and was a completely different man." The newspaper notes that among his Facebook favorites was the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

(The money wouldn't come from US taxpayers, but the State Department shed little light on the companies or kinds of investments involved.) Speaking at a World Economic Forum conference yesterday, the secretary of state said the investment could boost the Palestinian GDP by 50% in just three years and cut unemployment from 21% to around 8%, the Washington Post reports. "Now, is this fantasy? I don't think so, because there are already great examples of investment and entrepreneurship that are working in the West Bank," Kerry told the audience, which included Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, CNN reports. Kerry said the plan—which will be dependent on progress in peace talks—will focus on boosting the West Bank's tourism and agriculture sectors.

The Fox host, who previously defended Moore after the candidate was accused of sexual misconduct, issued an ultimatum Tuesday night, telling Moore he has 24 hours to explain "inconsistencies" in his story, the Washington Post reports. "You must remove any doubt," said Hannity, who was facing an advertiser boycott. "If he can't do this, then Judge Moore needs to get out of this race." AL.com reports that the Republican National Committee has also withdrawn its support of Moore, though the Alabama Republican Party has yet to issue a statement on the candidate. President Trump is expected to comment on Moore now that he is back in the US, and he faces what Politico describes as a "wrenching call," with congressional leaders urging him to help push Moore out of the race and conservative Moore loyalists strongly opposed to any such move. In an op-ed, the Wall Street Journal argues that Moore's "credibility has fallen below the level of survivability" and if he refuses to drop out, the Republican Party will be better off if Democrat Doug Jones wins. Moore, whose latest accuser says he sexually assaulted her when she was 16, spoke at a Baptist revival in an Alabama church Tuesday night but said little about the allegations, the AP reports. "I want to talk about where this country's going and if we don't get back to God, we're not going anywhere," he said.

Police tell the Journal-Constitution they were called to a hotel around 3:30am today about "someone shooting at a bus that Lil Wayne was on," and they found two buses shot multiple times; sources tell TMZ the shooting happened within minutes of the rapper's entourage pulling away from the club. No one was injured. Drivers said the buses were shot on a highway by two white vehicles, "possibly a Corvette-style vehicle and an SUV," police say, but so far there are no known suspects.

Tea Party candidate John Koster was caught on tape noting that as to cases when the life of the mother is at stake, "I'm not going to make that decision," Reuters reports. "But on the rape thing, it's like, how does putting more violence onto a woman's body and taking the life of an innocent child that's a consequence of this crime, how does that make it better?" He added: "I know crime has consequences, but how does it make it better by killing a child?" the Seattle Times reports. Koster's Democratic opponent, Suzan DelBene, calls the comments "out of touch." Koster's website now says DelBene supporters were up to "dirty tricks" with the tape, released by a liberal activist group. "The recording was done secretly, then edited to suit DelBene's agenda," Koster's campaign manager says. "The insinuation that John Koster is in some way 'callous' or 'cavalier' when it comes to the subject of rape is another example of the vicious and desperate tactics ... employed to slander the good name of John Koster."

The fuss started when a Russian official, in rebutting claims of those lousy hotel rooms, accused foreigners of sabotage with this quote to the Wall Street Journal: "We have surveillance video from the hotels that shows people turn on the shower, direct the nozzle at the wall, and then leave the room for the whole day." That set off a furious Internet reaction, most of it along the lines of the Huffington Post's "He's Watching You Shower!" headline, accompanied by a photo of Vladimir Putin. Amid the outcry, a spokesman for the original Russian official walked back the statement. "No such thing was ever said," he asserted, suggesting that it was either a mistranslation or a joke, reports AP. He insisted that no guests' hotel room have surveillance cameras. Of course, NBC reporter Richard Engel said this week that his equipment got hacked as soon as he arrived in Russia, notes HuffPo. “The State Department warns that travelers should have no expectation of privacy," he said. "Even in their hotel rooms."

According to a government investigation, Cho (also known as Heather Cho) became enraged when a flight attendant brought her macadamia nuts in a bag, not on a plate, so she screamed at him and demanded the plane be brought back to the gate to dump him. The crew chief also talked to local media and said that Cho cursed him out and jabbed him with a document folder, Reuters reports. Although Cho, the daughter of Korean Air CEO Cho Yang-ho, has since resigned from all posts, notes CNN, Seoul officials want to charge her with inflight violence and changing a flight route, the Guardian reports. Other people could also face repercussions: A current exec with the airline with the surname Yeo is being investigated for alleged attempts to cover up what happened, the Guardian notes; when the flight attendant in question was interviewed for the investigation, Yeo sat right next to him. And it hasn't gone unnoticed that most of the transport ministry officials now looking into the case have been employed by Korean Air at some point; separately, the BBC notes that one official was arrested today for allegedly leaking details of the investigation to Korean Air. A detention warrant for Cho was requested this morning, meaning the court thinks the accused might skip town or mar evidence, Reuters notes.

Jack Tytell, 40, known as the "Jewish Terrorist" in the Israeli press, shot to death a taxi driver and later a shepherd at point-blank range after moving to Israel from the US in 1997. Years later, he sent pipe bombs to a teenager and a professor at Hebrew University, and attacked a police station during a gay pride parade, reports the Jerusalem Post. Tytell claimed to be guided by angels, and his lawyers tried to get him a more lenient term with an insanity defense. The court rejected the strategy, however. Among the reasons: Tytell said he considered killing a Palestinian child but decided against it because it was "not the American way," reports the International Business Times. A judged deemed that evidence that Tytell knew right from wrong.

His two sons and a close business associate also face various charges for their alleged abuse of power to amass great wealth, the AP reports. Protesters had planned to hold a major march Friday calling for a public trial, among other reforms. “Every time the youth threaten to go to Tahrir Square again with a huge number of protesters, I think they make some concessions,” one political scientist tells Reuters. The decision puts to bed speculation that Egypt’s military rulers would spare the 83-year-old the indignity of a trial. Analysts have warned that trying Mubarak will make other Arab leaders more reluctant to step down peacefully. Mubarak is currently in custody in a Red Sea resort hospital, and his sons are in prison.

Users of newer versions of Windows can probably expect a security patch soon, but XP users may be out of luck, since Microsoft stopped supporting the operating system earlier this month. Lance Ulanoff at Mashable, however, says the flaw is so serious that it could be a mistake not to offer XP users one final patch.

Charges of rape and sexual coercion, stemming from alleged incidents last August, await the WikiLeaks founder in Sweden. "There can be no doubt that if what Mr. Assange had done had been done in England and Wales, he would have been charged," read the ruling, rejecting Assange's claim that his actions would not have been considered criminal in the UK. Supporters crowded outside the London courthouse, notes the Telegraph, carrying signs that echoed Assange's own claim that the charges were politically motivated. Assange's remaining hope of avoiding extradition is an appeal to the country's highest court, notes the AP, an avenue a legal expert says Assange can take only if today's ruling involves an issue of "real legal significance." Barring that, Assange will likely be extradited within 10 days.

A recently revealed list of two million Freemasons shows that members of their fraternity played a big role in the controversial investigation, the Telegraph reports. On the list are John Bigham, who oversaw the probe; Sydney Buxton, then president of the British Board of Trade; and at least two of five experts used in the inquiry. Lord Pirrie, who was chairman of the shipyard that built the Titanic and a director of the parent company that owned the ship's White Star Line, also apparently was a Freemason. "The Titanic inquiry in Britain was branded a 'whitewash' because it exonerated most of those involved," says Titanic expert Nic Compton. The probe interviewed only three passengers, Compton says, and even the ship's captain got off on the argument that ships at the time broke through ice at full throttle. A US Senate inquiry, however, criticized the White Star Line and accused the British Board of Trade of having far too few lifeboats on board—while the UK probe didn't censure the Board of Trade. Posted on Ancestry.com, the Freemason list contains thousands of influential names including statesmen, police, lawyers, and authors, and could force a reassessment of British history, the Telegraph says. There are said to be roughly 6 million Freemasons alive today, with a third of them living in the US, reports the Mirror, which runs through some high-profile members of the past. (The new list includes Jack the Ripper candidate Michael Maybrick, whose identity may have been hidden by fellow Masons).

This appears to be contingent on the president agreeing to sit for an interview. "We said to them, 'If we're going to be interviewed in July, how much time until the report gets issued?'" Giuliani tells the AP. "They said September, which is good for everyone, because no one wants this to drag into the midterms." Giuliani tells the Washington Post that Mueller floated the Sept. 1 deadline "as an incentive that if we do the interview, we can have more control over the termination date." Trump's legal team still has not decided whether he will indeed sit for an interview, and if he refuses to do so, that could result in a subpoena. "And if they subpoena him, there will be litigation. So no timeline on that,” Giuliani said. The obstruction allegations against Trump are just one part of Mueller's wide-ranging inquiry, meaning his work would continue even if the September deal happens, notes the Times. Giuliani told the newspaper the allegations boil down to James Comey's word against the president's. "We want the concentration of this to be on Comey versus the president’s credibility, and I think we win that and people get that." Giuliani's interviews come as the president ramped up his opposition to the "witch hunt" by promising to order the Justice Department to investigate whether the FBI spied on his campaign.

Called the "doc fix," it's designed to permanently solve a problem regarding the way doctors get paid by Medicare—instead of the annual short-term patches that have become routine over the years, reports Politico. John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi negotiated the bill together, and today it sailed through the House on a vote of 392-37. It now moves on to the Senate, where Democrats are leery about provisions that restrict the use of federal money for abortions, but the New York Times reports that the measure is expected to pass there, too. President Obama is in favor. "We've patched this problem 17 times over the last 11 years," Boehner said. "I had decided about a year ago that I had had enough of it." (He elaborates in an essay at the National Review.) The measure scraps the old Medicare payment formula and replaces it with one that, among other things, rewards doctors for the quality of care instead of the quantity. It also will require higher-income Medicare beneficiaries to pay bigger premiums, and it funds the Children's Health Insurance Program for two more years. (Democrats wanted four.) Without action, doctors would have faced a 21% cut in Medicare fees on April 1 under a formula called the Sustainable Growth Rate, reports the Hill.

Director Bill Condon says LeFou, sidekick to the film's villain and played by Josh Gad, is gay and the film will feature an "exclusively gay moment." But patrons of Henagar Drive-In Theatre won't see it. "When companies continually force their views on us, we need to take a stand," the owner of the drive-in says in a Facebook post Thursday. "If I can't sit through a movie with God or Jesus sitting by me, then we have no business showing it." The owner of the theater, which recently changed ownership, says having a gay character makes the film inappropriate for children. He says he's a Christian and the theater puts the Bible ahead of any financial considerations. That's good, because most of the responses to the post have been critical of the theater. But Henagar Drive-In Theatre isn't alone. NBC News reports a "pro-life and pro-family" group has started an online petition to boycott Beauty and the Beast (which NBC notes was already the story of "a girl who falls in love with an animal") because LeFou is gay. The petition has more than 50,000 signatures. Meanwhile, Variety's film critic says if Beauty and the Beast was attempting to portray LeFou as gay, it failed. So this may all be much ado about nothing.

Mark Sanford is expected to run for the seat in a special election, and while some had hoped scorned ex-wife Jenny would run against him, Politico reports that she announced yesterday she will not. She enjoys being a mother and thinks that's a more important job, she told reporters, according to the AP. Jenny Sanford had earlier signaled an interest in running. Meanwhile, Mark has not yet made a formal announcement, but was on a search for office space in Charleston last week and has campaign funds. Numerous outlets have reported that an announcement is imminent. Candidates can file as soon as Friday, with primaries scheduled for March 19 and the general election May 7. If Mark Sanford wins, he'll be back in the same congressional seat he held from 1995 to 2000.

The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges Weinstein raped de la Huerta twice in New York in December 2010, taunting her with phone calls between the two assaults. New York police said a year ago that they were investigating de la Huerta's allegations. No charges have been filed in the case, but Weinstein is charged there with the rape of another woman. In a new allegation, the suit states that the following month Weinstein exposed himself to the actress in a Beverly Hills hotel when she went to confront him. She alleges Weinstein tried to get de la Huerta to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman. About a year after the incidents, de la Huerta was fired from the HBO show Boardwalk Empire, and the lawsuit states she has reason to believe Weinstein was involved. It cites a photo that appeared in the New York Times of Weinstein talking to Martin Scorsese, a director and executive producer on the show, a few weeks before her firing. Weinstein's attorney Ben Brafman in response to the suit pointed out the lack of charges in New York, and said in an emailed statement that de la Huerta's "newly minted version of events including her new California claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination." More than 75 women have accused Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, of wrongdoing. (Click for all the details on de la Huerta's allegations.)

It's about a goat named Mr. G who got rescued from squalor and transported to the Animal Place sanctuary in Vacaville, California, reports Fox. Problem was, rescuers didn't realize how attached Mr. G was to a burro named Jellybean. Mr. G. didn't eat for six days and moped about in what seemed to be a depressive funk—until rescuers reunited him with Jellybean. "You might want to grab a tissue," advises Katie Dowd at the San Francisco Chronicle. "Mr. G’s reaction is so sweet and so incredibly human."

Juror B37 says she believes it was Zimmerman who was heard screaming for help in a 911 call, and all but "probably one" of the other jurors agreed. None of the jurors—five white and one Hispanic—believed race had a part in the shooting, she says. Zimmerman's "heart was in the right place" the night he killed Trayvon Martin, the juror says, but he "just got displaced by the vandalism in the neighborhoods and wanting to catch these people so badly that he went above and beyond what he really should have done." Miss B37 is the juror who inked a book deal about the case, but last night she released a statement through her agent saying she had dropped those plans, the Wall Street Journal reports. Being sequestered, she explained "shielded me from the depth of pain that exists among the general public over every aspect of this case." (As for Zimmerman, he is back in hiding, his parents tell ABC. They say they haven't seen him since the verdict and they are also in hiding after receiving an "enormous amount" of death threats.)

Halper is the largest single donor to the Occupy Wall Street movement, having donated $20,000 to the anti-corporate Adbusters magazine, which launched the protests. The weirdest thing about Halper is not that he’s a retired Wall Street trader who used to vice chair the New York Mercantile Exchange, or that he’s a 1-percenter. No, the weirdest thing about Halper is that in addition his Adbusters donation, he also donated the maximum allowed $2500 to the presidential campaign of corporate favorite Mitt Romney. “We can only imagine what it's like to have enough money to write several-thousand-dollar checks to causes that effectively cancel each other out,” writes Max Read on Gawker. Halper explains his giving to the New York Times as “a little ADD—like me.” He is a longtime donor to Adbusters and friend of the editor in chief, and wrote the check despite “rolling his eyes” at the idea initially, he says. He soon found himself swept up in the excitement and now makes daily visits to Zuccotti Park, which he calls “the coolest place in New York.” “If there’s pain,” he concludes, “it should be shared.”

Tyler Hadley, 17, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder after police acting on an anonymous tip-off arrived at the house and found the bodies, ABC News reports. The party had broken up by the time police arrived, and the teen seemed "nervous and panicky," claiming his parents were out of town, investigators say. Up to 60 teens attended the party, which Hadley apparently advertised on Facebook before killing his parents, reports the Broward Palm-Beach New Times.

A look at coverage of the anniversary: Bias starred at the University of Maryland, and a feature in the Baltimore Sun includes a memory of his first game as a starter. He was a nervous kid for much of it, until teammate Pete Holbert committed a foul, and Bias then took control and led the Terps to an OT win. "It was like, 'This guy is going to be really good," recalls Holbert. That prediction proved true. The Washington Post quotes Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski as saying in 2003 that only two opposing players had stood out in his long career: Bias and a guy named Michael Jordan. "He could invent ways to score, and there was nothing you could do about it," the coach said of Bias. Another person put it this way: "He was It." After his death—"the cruelest thing I've ever heard," said Celtics great Larry Bird—Bias became a pawn in the war on drugs, writes Jon Schuppe at NBC News. His OD "sparked a panic, stoked by false rumors and a high-stakes political campaign, that culminated in a law that swept thousands of low-level drug offenders—most of them young and black—into prison." The effects of that law, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, still resonate today. Bias' mother, Lonise, lost a second son to a drive-by shooting a few years later, and has since worked as a community activist helping young people, reports WTOP. A post at Deadspin sums it up this way: "His death still makes everyone crazy."

Two days after the alleged kidnapping on May 10, officials say a 63-year-old train maintenance worker vanished in South Salt Lake, about two miles from where Flint Harrison, 51, and Dereck Harrison, 22, were believed to be hiding out, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. Utah Transit Authority worker Kay Porter Ricks never came home from his night shift on May 12 and was found dead in Wyoming on Tuesday still wearing his work boots, reports the AP. His body—which had been there for days, per KSTU—was found off a dirt road about 120 miles from where the Harrisons camped after fleeing Utah, police say. His death has been ruled a homicide. Police say there is no "hard evidence" linking the Harrisons to Ricks' death, but "there are some coincidences there that would be impossible to ignore as we continue to investigate." Though Ricks' cellphone was found on a train platform in Utah, police say his white Ford pickup truck was spotted by surveillance cameras in Wyoming, which might explain how the Harrisons traveled out of state. The truck has not been found, though officials plan to search two lakes with sonar equipment. A rep for Ricks' family says that "though Kay's body may be dead, they know he lives and that they will see him again," per Fox 13. Both Harrisons are being held in Pinedale, Wyo., where their bail is set at $750,000 cash each.

Anti-Donald Trump conservative activists have stepped up their efforts to find a third-party alternative, but they'll have to file their paperwork in Texas by May 9 to get on the ballot, with deadlines in other states following soon, the Hill reports. Possibilities include former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's 2012 nominee, and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who called for an alternative to Trump and Clinton in a Facebook post Thursday. Rick Perry had also been mentioned, but he earned the scorn of Trump foes on Thursday when he dismissed the idea as "quixotic," endorsed Trump, and said he would be open to becoming his running mate, reports USA Today. Conservative blogger Erick Erickson has taken a leading role in the search for a Trump alternative and plans to hold talks with like-minded conservatives in the days to come, CNN reports. "It's an uphill climb, everybody recognizes that, regardless of the route we go, but there are a lot of Republican donors sitting on the sidelines who would rather fund a third party than fund Donald Trump," he tells the Hill. He says campaign finance experts believe a third-party bid would cost at least $250 million. Trump meanwhile, has a different suggestion for a third-party candidate. "Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise," he tweeted Thursday. "He should show them, & run as an Independent." (Paul Ryan says he's "just not ready" to support Trump.)

Once again, Rand Paul is at the center of things, with Paul saying his stance against the surveillance is a fight for civil liberties and critics like John McCain accusing him of fundraising theatrics, reports the Washington Post. As things stand now, key parts of the Patriot Act are set to expire on June 1. The Senate has gone into recess, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is bringing everybody back on May 31 for a rare Sunday session to try to figure out a last-minute fix. “This is a high-threat period,” said McConnell, who maintains that even a brief lapse in the act is a threat to national security. All this became necessary when the Senate last night blocked a House compromise measure called the USA Freedom Act that would curb the surveillance programs. (Under the bill, the NSA would no longer collect metadata but could still gain access to it from phone companies.) When that failed, McConnell tried to extend the expiring Patriot Act provisions by one week, then four days, then two days, and then one day. All the extensions were rejected, one by one, thanks to Paul and help from Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich. The upshot is that it's now "almost a sure bet that portions of the Patriot Act" will expire at least temporarily, reports the Hill, which notes that the House is in recess through the end of May.

Among other things, he rejected the idea that President Trump is considering pardons and defended his own move to delete old tweets in which he was critical of Trump. Details: Pardons: "The president is thinking about pardoning nobody," he said on CNN, adding that Trump "is not going to have to pardon anybody because the Russian thing is a nonsensical thing." (Trump tweeted about the power of presidential pardons on Saturday.) Pardons, take II: Trump attorney Jay Sekulow also dismissed the idea of pardon discussions, per the Hill. “We have not and I continue to not have conversations with the president of the United States about pardons,” he said on ABC's This Week. Not convinced: Scaramucci said Trump is still not convinced Russia interfered in the election. "He basically said to me, 'Hey you know, this is, maybe they did it, maybe they didn't do it.'" He also said he was speaking with somebody recently who asserted that if the Russians did indeed meddle, they would leave behind no evidence of it. Upon questioning, he told Jake Tapper the person who said that was, in fact, Trump, per Politico. Deleting tweets: Earlier over the weekend, Scaramucci deleted old tweets critical of Trump, explaining that "past views evolved & shouldn't be a distraction." The Hill notes that Scaramucci also publicly apologized to Trump on Friday. Moving on: "If I said some things about [Trump] when I was working for another candidate, Mr. Trump, Mr. President, I apologize for that. Can we move on off of that?" he said Sunday. Old column: One piece of criticism gaining attention is a 2016 column Scaramucci wrote for Fox Business in which he warned about "unbridled demagoguery" taking over the GOP. He did not, however, mention Trump by name in the column. Maureen Dowd: In her New York Times column, Dowd describes Scaramucci as a "wealthy mini-me Manhattan bro" who has much in common with Trump, including a big ego. But she says the hire won't solve the president's big problem, that being the "existential threat" posed by special investigator Robert Mueller. Trump, she writes, doesn't get that Mueller is not some "contractor" he can bully and intimidate.

Paul, in a speech that focused on the withdrawal of US troops from overseas, said the result was a sign of growing momentum for his beliefs, the AP reports. He received around 23% of the vote in New Hampshire—more than Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Rick Perry put together. Exit polls show he was the choice of 48% of voters under 25, and a third of all voters between 30 and 44, the Wall Street Journal notes.

And many others are feared missing, with an official in the northern Pakistan district of Chitral telling Al Jazeera that "some bodies might have been washed away to Afghanistan." The death toll in Chitral is said to be between 30 and 40 people. Meanwhile, NDTV says at least 40 people in the Indian states of Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh have also perished from flash floods and landslides over the past few days. Worshippers, including women and children, were in the mosque in the Chitral village of Ursoon offering a special Ramadan prayer when the floodwaters carried it away. A local disaster management authority rep says at least 16 from the mosque are believed to have died, CNN notes, with officials saying the far-flung village didn't receive an evacuation warning before the floods hit, per ABC.net. In a Sunday Facebook post, Pakistan's army says it's trying to get food, medical assistance, and tents to the displaced in Chitral as part of their rescue efforts. Al Jazeera notes that July and August rains caused by monsoons are usually very heavy and that shoddily built homes, especially in rural areas, are particularly vulnerable to being destroyed. At least 127 people died in April from heavy rain and landslides in northern Pakistan and Kashmir.

Trump is a "total disaster" who needs to go, Jimmy Kimmel told viewers. Trump supporters should "treat the situation like you would if you'd put Star Wars wallpaper up in the kitchen: 'All right, I got caught up. I was excited, I made a mistake, and now it needs to go,'" he said, per the New York Times. Kimmel suggested Trump be promoted to a king with no power. "We need to set him up in a castle ... lead him to the top and then lock the door to that castle—forever." Other reactions: Stephen Colbert. The Late Show host played a clip of Trump saying "I think there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and neither do you," and quipped: "The only thing I'm doubting right now is if you’re still going to be president by Friday," Mediaite reports. Colbert also poked fun at Trump for saying the white nationalists in Charlottesville had a permit for their protest. "You've got to give it to the Nazis," he said. "They always do their paperwork." James Corden. The CBS host mocked Trump for saying he waited until he had all the facts before commenting on Charlottesville. "It's true, he only makes a statement when he has the facts," he said. "You know, like when he told us how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history. Or that time he told us Meryl Streep was a bad actress." Seth Meyers. Meyers introduced a new segment called "Breaking Crazy" to deal with what he described as a "clinically insane" performance. "Trump is like a bad waitress in a crappy diner who’s trying to get fired so she can go to a concert," he said. "Congress, isn't this enough? Cut bait on the president." Conan O'Brien. "In the press conference, President Trump said that Steve Bannon was a good friend and not a racist," O'Brien said, per the Washington Post. "Then he said, 'Oops, I meant to say, 'a good racist, and not a friend.'" The Daily Show. The most-quoted remark from the show was a tweet hours before airtime: "Today is the day Donald Trump became president of the Confederacy."

It was the act of a hero, according to media outlets in Brazil, where the wild scene was caught on video Saturday, per NBC News. Authorities say two armed robbers walked into a pharmacy in Campo Limpo Paulista, unaware that off-duty Sao Paulo police sergeant Rafael Souza was inside with his wife and infant son, reports the New York Post. When one of the men aimed his gun at Souza, the officer pulled out his own weapon and pulled the trigger, despite the infant in his arms. At one point, Souza is seen on a surveillance video shooting one of the men at close range. He then rushes his child to his wife, who is taking cover in an aisle, before continuing the gun battle, per the Washington Post. Police say it ended with both robbers dead. The men are identified as Jefferson Alves, 24, and Italo Creato, 22. Souza later told investigators that he fired first because he anticipated they would shoot him if he identified himself as a police officer. The pharmacy clerk had been assisting Souza's wife in an aisle when the robbers barged in, per the Post. (This cop's act of heroism cost him his life.)

A report ranks 29 multinational tech companies on their responsiveness to inquiries about conditions at supplier factories; Apple comes in last, the Financial Times reports. The report cites Apple’s failure to respond to poisonings that hospitalized 49 workers at one site. “Apple behaved differently from the other big brands and seemed totally complacent and unresponsive,” the report’s main author told the FT. The criticism follows a spate of suicides at another Apple supplier, Foxconn, and Ariel Schwartz of Fast Company says the company better be careful. “If Apple continues to ignore supply chain issues, the problems will only grow—and eventually, they will come back to haunt the company.”

Some early reaction to his news conference: Brian Wingfield, Forbes: "The public outcry over the disaster has left the administration little choice but to take ownership of resolving it, but in doing so the White House has also boxed itself into a corner. For every day the disaster and the cleanup efforts continue, the administration is squarely on the hook. ... Until the leak is plugged, expect (public) outrage to grow in proportion to the amount of oil in the Gulf of Mexico." Also, watch those predictions. Remember "Mission Accomplished"? Gus Lubin, Business Insider: Obama says it's been a priority from day one. "But here's the catch. For him to make that claim, Obama is forced to claim authority over the BP response from the start—saying he could have stepped in at any time. That means defending everything BP has done." This won't "go over well with a furious nation" or "Democrats in Congress who have pummeled BP." Chris Cillizza, Washington Post: Obama argued that the US is in control on strategy but needs BP's technological expertise. "It's a nuanced argument to make and a distinction that Obama has to hope average Americans understand."

But at 55, he's a very different man, DNAInfo reports. "If I would have understood then what I know now at my age, man, that would have never happened," Tillman says. He worked alongside "Freeway" Rick Ross, the LA drug kingpin who built a nationwide drug enterprise that sold more than half a million nuggets of the drug daily, the Los Angeles Times reported in 1995; in a look at Ross last year, Esquire noted that it's estimated he bought and resold three tons of cocaine over a seven-year period in the '80s. In Chicago alone, the then-20-something Tillman was taking in $9 million a month from the gangs he sold to, which was nearly all of them. "I had more money than the pope," Tillman says, and purchased more homes in which to cook cocaine into crack than he could keep straight. But he had a total change of heart when his brother was killed in 1990. "I saw his body, and that’s when I quit selling cocaine." Now, traveling through Chicago, he reflects on his actions: "People literally smoked up everything—first their jobs, then their assets, then their retirement, and then their lives—in a cocaine pipe. My whole family is gone," he notes. "Man, I am real remorseful about that." In recent years, he's worked to help those in need of drug treatment, and today, he runs the Freeway Boys Foundation, which is focused on helping released inmates get their lives back on track. The group's chairman, per its website, is Ross, who was released from prison in 2009; DNAInfo notes Tillman never served time for his dealing.

In its analysis, DealNews finds that Cyber Monday is generally better for shoppers in four categories: laptops, small kitchen appliances, shoes, and travel deals. "It's particularly a great time to book hotel stays, vacation packages, and flights," writes Julie Ramhold. A sampling of guides out there: Big TVs: Kinja has a comprehensive list in various categories. In tech, its "showstopper" is Samsung’s 49-inch curved, HDR, Quantum Dot-powered display for $1,000 on Amazon, a savings of $200. Travel: Conde Nast Traveler focuses in on travel bargains, from hotels to safaris to cruises. On the latter, it finds that "Princess Cruises will take up to $1,000 off per stateroom, plus reduced fares for the third and fourth guests." Customers also get 50% off booking deposits on Cyber Monday.

Random House is republishing four Dr. Seuss stories on Sept. 9 that haven't been seen since the 1950s, when they first made their appearance in Redbook magazine, reports USA Today. A Massachusetts collector who previously helped the book publisher exhume other long-forgotten Seuss tales is also the source of this new collection, entitled Horton and the Kwuggerbug and More Lost Stories. The new tongue-twisting tales by Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, feature our old friend Horton; an appearance by Marco, the subject of Seuss' first children's book, And to Think I Saw It on Mulberry Street; and a slightly different Grinch than Whoville's villain—though this one also thinks that "that everyone is a mindless consumer who can be manipulated," according to collector Charles Cohen via USA Today. "For the most part, those [Redbook] magazines were tossed out … and the stories were largely forgotten," Cohen adds. A review in Publishers Weekly says the stories may not be "gems," but they do show Geisel honing his craft and characters.

The appeals are obvious: juices tend to be stripped of fiber and loaded with sugar, and soups can be more dense, filling, and warm, not to mention tasty given the commonly added spices such as turmeric and cumin. So was this a passing fad? Apparently not. Tech Times is declaring soup to be a diet trend of 2017 that will likely replace juice cleanses. The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, offers up a round-up of new souping companies cropping up nationwide, some of which also offer bone broth options, popular in fasts and cleanses. The typical daily caloric intake from souping cleanses hovers around 1,200. Not everyone is thrilled. One dietician wrote in the Huffington Post in April that while soups are a better component to a meal than juices, they're both insufficient alone and trick people into thinking they need to buy bottled products to get their organs to cleanse their bodies: "Encouraging that low of a calorie intake anytime is a big red flag in my book. I’m not a fan of starving people—ever." She adds that our lungs, kidneys, liver, and skin are "wondrous organs that detox naturally when we don't resort to unhealthy behaviors." For its part, the Times also reported in April that while juices can be very healthy and Americans should eat more vegetables, chewing is important, and there is no good science behind the detox trends.

That bodes well ahead of its American premiere on Friday, underscoring its chances of unseating The Avengers' record $207.4 million domestic opening. "To say we are beyond encouraged is an understatement," says a studio exec. This weekend's domestic numbers were much more modest, adds the AP: Mark Wahlberg's Pain & Gain posted a $20 million debut for the No. 1 spot, while Tom Cruise's Oblivion dropped to No. 2 with $17.4 million.

The French president had to acknowledge his affair with an actress, a growing mess that sent his other girlfriend to the hospital. And now? Manure, and lots of it, dumped in his name outside the French parliament in Paris, reports AFP. "Out with Hollande and the whole political class!" said the message on the protester's tractor-trailer. (BuzzFeed has photos.) It's not clear that the protester had Hollande's affair in mind, but the president nonetheless has the worst popularity ratings "of any leader in modern-day France," notes Reuters. Police arrested the protester before he got all the manure unloaded.

Paul Ryan's proposal wouldn't have changed anything for people already 55 and older, and it would only have altered—not ended—Medicare for others, says the non-partisan fact-checking website. It points to "nine separate fact-checks" invalidating the Democrats' claim. Simply replacing "end Medicare" with "privatize Medicare" would have been a big improvement, the site suggests. But PolitiFact acknowledges that a number of key voices—among them Talking Points Memo, the Daily Kos, and Paul Krugman—disagree. (The Huffington Post's headline was "Politi-Fail.") Indeed, the Washington Monthly calls PolitiFact's analysis "indefensible." "The House Republican budget plan intended to privatize the existing system and replace it with something very different—a voucher scheme," writes Steve Benen. "It would still be called 'Medicare,' but it wouldn’t be Medicare." (Click to read how Ryan has since altered his plan.)

After the video went viral on Monday, resource officer Ben Fields was shifted to administrative duties pending an investigation, the State reports, and the school district says Fields has been told "not to return to any school in the district." A Richland County Sheriff's Department spokesman says the girl, who was still seated when Fields flipped her desk over, was arrested for disturbing the peace. A fellow Spring Valley High School student tells NBC News that the officer was called in after the girl refused a request to leave the classroom. The girl shows no sign of resistance during the video, and in a longer version, Fields can be heard threatening to arrest a student who objected, reports Reuters. A sheriff's office spokesman tells the State that the sheriff has seen the video and "was very disturbed by what he saw." NBC reports that a 2013 lawsuit accused Fields, who is white, of "unfairly and recklessly" targeting "African-American students with allegations of gang membership and criminal gang activity." Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin issued a statement calling the officer's behavior unacceptable and asking for an independent investigation, the State reports.

It must be true because Mayor Bloomberg and police chief Ray Kelly keeping trumpeting the stat, and the media keep circulating it. (Like in this profile.) ProPublica took a look at the NYPD's own list of the 14 to test the accuracy of the claim. "Is it true? In a word, no," writes Justin Elliott. The boast "overstates both the number of serious, developed terrorist plots against New York and exaggerates the NYPD's role in stopping attacks." Of the 14, ProPublica says two, maybe three, qualify as true terror threats. And that includes "a failed attempt to bomb Times Square by a Pakistani-American in 2010 that the NYPD did not stop." What's more, the NYPD doesn't seem to have played a big role in most of the busts. "In several cases, it played no role at all." See the full article and a breakdown of the 14 cases here. (Asked about the story today, Bloomberg responded: “I could make as cogent an argument there’s double or triple the number that were stopped. We just don’t know about it." More on that here.)

As many as 2,000 vets will arrive in North Dakota on Sunday with the goal of "protecting the protesters," Marine Corps veteran Anthony Diggs says. “There is a lot of power in veterans from all over, from all branches of the military, coming together to create a protecting front against the police, who are militarized themselves,” he says. But the vets aren't just bringing symbolism; they've raised around half a million dollars to help protesters get through the winter and are bringing supplies, lawyers, and more. The vets are expected to arrive the day before the Army Corp of Engineers had ordered protesters to abandon their camp on federal land. But while the Army Corps has since said it won't force protesters off the land, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple issued an "emergency evacuation" of the camp Monday in the face of an oncoming blizzard, Reuters reports. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says it has no plans to move, and its chairman points out it's ironic that Dalrymple is suddenly concerned about cold protesters days after police sprayed them with fire hoses. Contrary to previous reports, Dalrymple won't block food and supplies from getting to protesters as part of the evacuation, according to the AP. A spokesperson says that had been "misconstrued."

Researchers concluded that after Los Angeles authorities shut down hundreds of dispensaries last year, crime actually increased around the closed facilities. The victory proved short-lived: Rand has pulled the controversial study for review after the LA city attorney and other officials demanded its retraction, reports the Los Angeles Times. “As we’ve begun to take a look at the report, we decided it’s best to remove it from circulation until that review is complete," said a spokesman. The city attorney had criticized the study—which compared crime stats in particular areas 10 days before the dispensaries shut down and 10 days after—as "highly suspect and unreliable."

But the guest coming up on her June 18 show may be generating even more attention: conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of Infowars. Given that Jones has suggested, among other things, that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax and that 9/11 was an "inside job," the choice is generating a ton of criticism already. Coverage: Teaser: NBC has released a teaser of the interview, in which Kelly challenges Jones on Sandy Hook in particular and accuses him of a "dodge" in his response. See it here. Typical sentiment: A post at AV Club voices a common sentiment among those criticizing the choice. "She may be calling him out for his claims that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax, but she’s still giving him an opportunity to defend that repugnant argument," writes Sam Barsanti. Kelly's defense: She notes that President Trump has praised Jones and wants to give him White House press credentials. "Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light," she tweets. Mother's response: “By making this choice, you grieve our hearts and the memory of our child,” tweets Nelba Marquez-Greene, whose daughter, Ana Grace, was killed in the school shooting. “You have a powerful platform. I encourage you to ‘shine light’ on affirming the losses suffered here- NOT on a person who mocks those losses…. Evil doesn’t need another platform.” Much more: HuffPost rounds up the many critical tweets surfacing about the interview. One in particular catching attention: "My nephew survived Sandy Hook. I am not tolerating this. Will never watch @megynkelly or @NBCNews again if they choose to air this." Jones' reaction: On Friday, Jones posted a video in which he goes after Kelly personally in the wake of their interview, notes Mediaite. "Not feminine. Cold. Robotic. Dead," Jones said. "I felt zero attraction to Megyn Kelly. That’s not an insult to Megyn Kelly. I talked to a lot of other folks that know her. They say, ‘No. It’s the same.’ Because you’re dealing with…sociopath? A psychopath? I don’t know.” 'Performance artist': In his recent child custody case, Jones told the court that he is merely a "performance artist." He lost the case.

The 23-year-old Australian who convinced the world that his awkward-sounding name had resulted in Facebook shutting down his account now says the whole thing was a hoax. He apparently spilled the beans after SBS News contacted him with doubts about his story, noting that a passport photo he provided was Photoshopped and the name "Bich" isn't a common Vietnamese surname. "What started as a joke between friends became a prank that made a fool out of the media," he wrote on Facebook Wednesday, identifying himself as Joe Carr—or possibly "joker," per the BBC. He tells the Herald his name is actually Tin Le, while Mashable identifies him by way of a supposed former classmate as Thien Nguyen. The Herald notes he asked to be called "Mr. T" for fear that he would lose his job. He says the ruse began "with me fooling Facebook, it then somehow shared across the pages." The "ordeal" taught him "not to trust the credibility of the media," the prankster adds. "It goes to show that an average joe like myself can con the biggest news sources with ease." He also thanks the people who stood by him, even though it was all for naught. "To those who do have culturally specific and spectacular names, ignore the ignorance in those who may try to put you down," he says. "Continue being the best person you can be and make your mark on the world in whatever way you can—even if it is a simple prank." (Click for a list of major Internet hoaxes, complete with pictures.)

The price of benchmark US crude rose 74 cents to $70.46 a barrel, the first time since 2014 the cost has exceeded $70, reports the AP. The development, which is expected to result in higher gas prices, comes as analysts await Trump's May 12 decision on whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal he sees as a failure, reports Reuters. If the US withdraws from the deal, analysts expect Iranian oil exports to fall. Also hitting oil prices was a worsening economic crisis in Venezuela.

Mario Zervigon, his family, and fellow tenants escaped their New Orleans apartment building on Thursday, leaving Zervigon stunned by an attack that investigators say is clearly arson. "I don't know if I was targeted," he tells the Times-Picayune. "I don't know what's what. It's just a shock." Zervigon works as a fundraiser for state utility regulatory board candidate Forest Bradley-Wright, who believes that people with solar panels should be allowed to sell off their extra electricity to utility companies. Bradley-Wright is in a runoff with incumbent Eric Skrmetta, who wants to limit the amount that solar users can sell. "I don't know if [the attack] is connected to anything I do," says Zervigon. What he's done lately: help Bradley-Wright raise about $210,000, including $100,000 over the past 10 days—which nearly equals the $215,000 that Skrmetta has raised. The ATF, which is investigating because the blaze destroyed a commercial building, says it will take "a few weeks" to turn up lab results on the fire. "Obviously, someone did this," says Zervigon's wife. "Why would you think anything like this would ever happen in New Orleans?"

The Wall Street Journal reports that the pope took Europe to task today during a speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, calling the continent "elderly and haggard" and "no longer fertile and vibrant"—not to mention "fearful and self-absorbed," "a grandmother," and "slowly losing its own soul," per the New York Times and BBC. He focused on Europe's struggles with immigration and youth unemployment. Among the highlights: "We cannot allow the Mediterranean to become a vast cemetery," he says of immigrants who have died trying to reach European shores—including over 3,000 who didn't survive journeys to Italy in old boats. "The great ideas which once inspired Europe seem to have lost their attraction, only to be replaced by the bureaucratic technicalities of its institutions," he says. Yet he also warned of capitalism, saying that "men and women risk being reduced to mere cogs in a machine that treats them as items of consumption to be exploited." His solution for rampant youth unemployment: "The time has come to promote policies that create employment" by “joining market flexibility with the need for stability and security" for employees. The visit was only Francis' second inside of Europe (the Muslim-majority nation of Albania was first) and marked his shortest trip abroad at barely four hours. Strasbourg residents were able to see his talk on a big screen in the city's cathedral, but not all were thrilled with the arrangement: "He knows what he is doing but we would have liked him to be here," says a worshipper.

Actor and broadcaster Stephen Fry has returned to Twitter after he quit in a snit over the uproar triggered by his comments that women don't like sex because they don't "shag" in bushes. Fry declares he's neither an "antediluvian pig" or a "twatty prune," and is "quite assured of the fact that women do indeed enjoy sex." He posted his comments in a lengthly blog linked to his first new Twitter message vowing to set the record "straightish." He realizes his comments were "offensive, ignorant, arrogant," but he was simply "taking a thought for a walk" during the magazine interview that triggered the hoopla, and now wants to "slink" back to Twitter "as if nothing happened," he notes. The popular gay actor, who has a recurring role on US TV playing a shrink in the series Bones, vows to do his best to avoid future print interviews, comparing the experience to being "mugged, raped, or burgled," reports the Telegraph. He admitted at an appearance in Los Angeles last night: "As a gay man, female sexuality is patently a closed book to me."

"Obvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort then a garden-variety relationship.

The song has been streamed some 235 million times, the Huffington Post reports, making it the music service's most-listened-to song. The runner-up? "Blurred Lines," by Robin Thicke, TI, and Pharrell Williams. That one's been streamed just 160 million times, however. Spotify has also revealed its leading male and female artists: Eminem and Rihanna. The service just announced that it's got more than 40 million users—including 10 million paying subscribers. It leads among comparable services like Deezer and Rhapsody, the Huffington Post notes, and it's about 100 times as big as Beats Music, Quartz reports. But that's not enough to make it profitable, Businessweek notes. Pandora, by comparison, has 250 million worldwide users, the Daily Mail reports, though its service doesn't allow the level of user control offered by Spotify. The top music streaming source, however, is actually a video service: YouTube.

He makes up for it with a touching tribute to his friend and co-star on his blog, writing that his world is "about 134% less funny" without the quick-to-laugh Dunn in it. But Dunn could also be serious, and was a "great listener," always available to talk over a game of pool. "Ryan also had an enormous capacity to love. His friends and family got a lot, but a lion's share of that went to his sweet and beautiful Angie," Knoxville continues, noting that Dunn was always wondering out loud how he got such a great girlfriend. "Well, it sure wasn't because of the way he smelled that's for sure. ... It was because he had a pure, open heart." Click for more from Knoxville's tribute.

Sessions—a longstanding Trump ally who was the first GOP senator to support his candidacy—made the offer in recent weeks after Trump was infuriated by his decision to recuse himself from the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling, sources tell ABC News and the Wall Street Journal. The sources say Trump was deeply disappointed by Sessions' decision, which he viewed as a sign of weakness, though the president rejected the AG's offer to resign. Sessions recused himself from the investigation after it emerged that during his confirmation hearings, he had failed to disclose meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Sources tell the Washington Post that Trump considers the decision to be a major factor behind the appointment of a special counsel to lead the Russia probe. Trump has also complained about the Justice Department's handling of his attempt to ban travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment Tuesday when asked whether Trump still has faith in the attorney general. "I have not had that discussion with him," Spicer said.

Reagan's first victory "was not only a referendum on the failed policies of President Carter," but also Reagan's clear vision for the country. "The 'R' next to the name cannot be just about being Republican, it’s got to be about reformer," Walker says. "I think he's got the capacity to do that." Elsewhere on your Sunday dial, as per Politico: Walker on Romney's chances in Wisconsin: "Six months ago, I think the White House had it firmly in their column. I think it is up in the air." Mitch Daniels' advice for Romney: “He’s got to build a consensus across a broad spectrum of Americans to make the big changes we need to restore a vibrant private sector. He better have an affirmative, constructive message, one of hope. I think that he will and that’s why ultimately I think he will prevail.” David Axelrod's advice for Romney's plans to cut firefighters, cops, and teachers: “I would suggest he’s living on a different planet if he thinks that’s a prescription for a stronger economy." Rick Santorum on his vice presidential prospects: “No one’s asked me for anything right now. If he calls me, I’ll answer the phone call but I’m not anxious to get back involved in the fray right now.” And Mike Huckabee on his: "I think there’s a greater likelihood that I’ll be asked by Madonna to go on tour as her backup than I’ll be picked to be on the ticket.”

"Understand what's at stake here: It's whether we're going forward or going backward," Obama told a crowd of 1,500 at Northeastern University. "As much progress as we've made, I can't do it alone." Coakley's rival, Scott Brown, said on a bus tour across the state that he would make the Senate Democrats "start over," reports the Los Angeles Times. "As the 41st senator, I will make sure we do it better," he told crowds who responded by chanting "41" —the number of Senate votes Republicans need to filibuster legislation. Brown is up 51% to Coakley's 46% in the latest numbers from Public Policy Polling.

There were precious few signs of progress in fiscal cliff negotiations yesterday, with both sides mainly making political statements blaming each other. Here's the latest: John Boehner, unable to pass even his own "Plan B," is now calling on the Senate to solve the problem. "The House will take action on whatever the Senate can pass, but the Senate first must act," he said, according to the New York Times. But Harry Reid points out that the Senate has already passed a bill that would prevent tax increases on all households making less than $250,000. "The Senate has already rejected House Republicans' Tea Party bills," he said, calling on Republicans to "drop their knee-jerk obstruction." Boehner hasn't called House members back to Washington yet, so though a session is scheduled for 2pm, it'll likely recess immediately. Senators are set to return this evening, but will have no proposal to consider. No Senate deal can pass without Mitch McConnell's approval, but a spokesman says neither Reid nor President Obama has reached out to him. The LA Times reports that McConnell helped devise Boehner's Plan B, but with re-election looming, McConnell is reluctant to get involved. "I cannot emphasize how little a constructive role he will play," says one Democratic strategist. Aides in both parties tell the Washington Post that the most logical step would be for Harry Reid to amend the House bill to let taxes rise for the wealthy and to extend unemployment benefits—without addressing the debt ceiling or making major spending cuts. President Obama will be back in Washington by noon, after a Hawaiian holiday vacation, according to the Hill. His aides have been in contact with Harry Reid's office in recent days, but their conversations haven't included Republicans, the AP reports. Democrats increasingly believe Republicans will wait to act until after Boehner is re-elected speaker on Jan. 3. "I think there's some chance that we get a deal done in the early weeks of January," one representative said yesterday, "which technically means you're going over the cliff."

A March 28 ruling by South Africa's Supreme Court, released Monday, rejects Pistorius' request to appeal his 13-year jail sentence for the 2013 murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, handed down in November after prosecutors objected to an initial six-year sentence. "This is the end of the road. There are no other legal options available," a rep for the National Prosecuting Authority tells AFP.

So now what? Chavez's camp says it's no big deal, arguing that the swearing-in is a mere formality that can be postponed until Chavez is well enough to travel. But the opposition thinks the constitution makes clear that if the incoming president can't be sworn in, the National Assembly leader must form a caretaker government and call new elections. It wants the nation's Supreme Court to settle the dispute. "The Supreme Court has to take a position on what the text of the constitution says," says opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who lost to Chavez in the fall election. "There is no monarchy here, and we aren't in Cuba." The National Assembly leader, for his part, says he has no intention of taking over on Thursday, reports CNN. "When (the opposition) talks about a power vacuum, they are proposing a coup."

The latest development: The New York Times reports that she requested research into billionaire George Soros after he went after Facebook. Sandberg sent an email to the company's communications team requesting the research after Soros called Facebook a "menace to society" at a global forum in January. Sandberg has been downplaying her role in the opposition research conducted on Soros and other Facebook critics ever since an earlier Times report revealed that Facebook had hired a firm called Definers Public Affairs. But the email, which BuzzFeed reports Facebook confirmed, suggests she played a larger role than first acknowledged. A Facebook statement downplayed the significance of the new report, saying Sandberg wanted to know if Soros stood to gain financially from his criticism. “Mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,” the company said. “That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook's stock." Sandberg initially said she was unaware Facebook had hired Definers, then acknowledged that some of its work had shown up on her desk. A spokesman for an anti-Facebook coalition called Freedom From Facebook said Sandberg has lost credibility. "In light of Sandberg’s continuously changing story on the Soros research, there's no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value," said Eddie Vale. He called on Facebook to release all emails about its opposition research. (Mark Zuckerberg says neither he nor Sandberg will be leaving the company anytime soon.)

High points included the cold open, which got in a few solid shots at BP and Halliburton; the coke-bender-themed digital short; a school athletic awards sketch that "was essentially Alec Baldwin saying incredibly mean things about schoolchildren for three minutes"; and the return of "Nasim Pedrad as Bedelia, the teenager who thinks her parents are just the coolest."

The lead researcher from Denmark's Aarhus University tells the BBC that the switch is much like adjusting a flashlight. If you're looking for your car in a parking lot, "you could use a narrow beam over a long distance and still see a lot," she says. "But when you're trying to get your keys into the car, you would switch to a wider beam. This is similar to what we see in porpoises." The beam is controlled by a fatty structure in the porpoise's head called the melon. "Like some bats, harbor porpoises can broaden their biosonar beam during the terminal phase of attack but, unlike bats, maintain the ability to change beamwidth within this phase," the researchers write in the journal eLife. The team, which studied harbor porpoises in a semi-enclosed research facility that gave the animals seafloor access, believes other dolphins and whales have the same sonar ability. The lead researcher tells the BBC that the discovery suggests many porpoises end up in fishing nets because of "attention blindness" that causes them to ignore potential hazards as they zero in on a fish. (Porpoises in San Francisco Bay face another hazard: gangs of angry young dolphins.)

The sides also have different stories for what caused the blast; rebels say it was the result of government shelling, while the government says it was an accident at a rebel bomb-making factory, the AP reports. A BBC correspondent says the level of devastation is too heavy for conventional shelling, though activists have raised the possibility that it could have been a Scud missile. They're urging UN observers to visit Hama to investigate, and calling for an emergency UN Security Council meeting, the AFP reports. The Syrian National Council says more than 100 have died in Hama in recent days, and they want military intervention to protect civilians.

Or, more accurately, he wants you and everyone you know to print out whatever portion of the Internet strikes your fancy and mail it to him.

This is, as you might have guessed, not a practical endeavor; it's an exhibition for the LABOR gallery in Mexico City, intended to honor hacker/activist Aaron Swartz. "The amount of what he liberated was enormous," Goldsmith tells Yahoo Tech. He admits that the whole Internet, or even a real chunk, would "overwhelm any space," but he wants to "literally materialize the amount of information around us."

The White House said today that it will allow the export of armed drones to other nations, reports the Washington Post. The newspaper calls the move "a significant step for US arms policy as allied nations from Italy to Turkey to the Persian Gulf region clamor for the aircraft." To ease concerns about abuses, the State Department says it will make any nations that buy the drones pledge not to use them against their civilian populations, but instead only in "internationally sanctioned military operations," reports the AP. The US currently sells armed drones only to Britain, and the previous restrictions had allowed nations such as Israel to gain an early advantage in the international market, reports the Wall Street Journal. The State Department says that by allowing the exports, it can now play a bigger role in helping shape international standards on the use of military drones. (The White House also recently laid out new rules governing the use of domestic drones.)

The father of the woman he killed, meanwhile, offers this assessment to a German newspaper: "If it didn't happen the way he says it did, he must suffer and he will suffer," says Barry Steenkamp. "It does not matter how much he has and how good his legal team is, he will have to live with his conscience. But if he speaks the truth, I can perhaps some day forgive him." Pistorius, who maintains that he mistook Reeva Steenkamp for a burglar, is not due back in court until June 4, and his coach says he might put the Olympian back into training as soon as Monday, reports the Daily Mail. His relatives sent a bouquet of flowers to Reeva's mother, but it does not appear to have gone over well. "What does it mean?" asks June Steenkamp. "Nothing." Also today, CNN reports that Pistorius' brother had his Twitter account hacked, and the family is now canceling its social media accounts as a result.

US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly issued the ruling that blocked immediate deportations, prompting plenty of coverage about her and the scope of the decision: Donnelly, 57, has been on the federal bench a little more than a year, having been nominated by President Obama on a recommendation from Sen. Chuck Schumer, reports the Daily News. Before joining the court, she worked as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan. "She will not be perturbed by the storm around her," a former colleague in Manhattan tells the New York Times, adding that she has "a firm moral compass." One of her biggest cases there was as the successful lead prosecutor in a 2005 Tyco corruption trial. A Washington Post profile emphasizes her close family, noting that the "daughter of Mary and Jack Donnelly" made a point to individually introduce all her relatives (including her two daughters) to the Senate during confirmation proceedings. "And then Saturday night ... Donnelly sat in her own courtroom in Brooklyn while families shouted and cried in airports nationwide." Still, Donnelly's ruling—and similar ones by federal judges in Seattle; Alexandria, Va., and Boston—is fairly limited, dealing only with a few hundred people caught in the immediate limbo of the decision, explains Politico. It doesn't affect the larger scope of Trump's order, which could affect tens or even hundreds of thousands of people, and may well be "fleeting." The Times has a separate piece on the legal path ahead, with the ACLU hailing Donnelly's ruling as an important first step. "Litigation is going to be a key tool for either undoing these policies or slowing them down," says executive director Anthony Romero.

Appearing at last night's "A Decade of Difference" concert in salute of the William J. Clinton Foundation, Gaga told the crowd, "Tonight I thought we'd all get caught up in a little Bill romance," later telling the former prez, "I love you and your hot wife," before demanding that "Billary" "sit back down where you belong in the Oval Office with those high heels on." Finally: "If someone had told me so many years ago that I'd be doing that right in front of you ... I would have given a good American f**k you." Other highlights from the star-studded show, as per the Hollywood Reporter and E! Online: Usher, who mixed typical fare with an unlikely but dead-on Beatles tribute, suffered a wardrobe malfunction in the form of a rip in his pants. He soldiered on—giving the crowd an eyeful of left thigh, but nothing more—later wryly noting, "I work hard." Ashton Kutcher took the stage to loud cheers, and in perhaps a Freudian slip, referred to his charity with wife Demi Moore as, "my foundation." Stevie Wonder rocked the house, and even made Clinton tear up with "Sir Duke," before turning to "For Once in My Life" and "Superstitious." Other performers included Kenny Chesney, K'naan, Juanes, and Bono and the Edge, who closed out the show. The latter duo sang "Miss Sarajevo," with Bono tackling Luciano Pavarotti's opera part himself. Bubba himself took the stage, saying, "I've got to put on my glasses, there's gotta be someone on this stage tonight who's not cool."

Omarosa had appeared on GMA Thursday to offer her side of things in the White House hubbub, and after the camera cut away from Omarosa's interview, in which she said she had a story she'd ultimately tell of her White House days, the camera turned to Roberts, who noted, "She says she has a story to tell, and I'm sure she will be selling that story.

More on the Omarosa storm swirling online: "Bye, Felicia" was actually the "ultimate" way for Roberts to say her goodbyes to Omarosa, the New York Daily News notes. The paper rehashes the phrase's history and offers rapper Ice Cube's explainer on its essence, which is a way "to get anybody out of your face that's saying something stupid." It's originally from his 1995 comedy Friday.

The 33-year-old guitar teacher, his wife, their 3-day-old baby, and family members were gathered Tuesday night at the home in Panama City, Fla., when a bullet entered the home and struck Ayers in the back of the head, killing him. Police arrived and found neighbor Charles Edward Shisler, 62, in his backyard; he lives in a home directly behind the Ayers, the officer tells WJHG. Shisler, at first "extremely belligerent," ultimately admitted to the shooting but said it was an accident, the News Herald reports. "The damn gun doesn’t usually shoot," he said, according to the arrest report. "You have to squeeze the hell out of the trigger to shoot it." He said he picked up the loaded 9mm pistol by its trigger, and the gun discharged. The bullet traveled some 200 feet—through a window screen, a wooded area, the Ayers' sliding glass back door, and into their house. More than four hours after the shooting, a blood test found Shisler's BAC was 0.079, according to authorities; Florida's legal limit for driving is 0.08, the Raw Story notes. He has been charged with manslaughter as well as possession of a firearm by a convicted felon; he had a previous felony weapons conviction. "I had just gotten a picture of [Ayers] and the baby which was just born Father’s Day," a close friend of Ayers tells WMBB. "The look on his face was just priceless." (In October, another Florida man who killed himself accidentally hit his neighbor with the same bullet.)

Bill Haslam has a bill coming his way that has the Bible nominated as the official state book, a move critics say would be both "unconstitutional and sacrilegious," per Nashville Public Radio. The state Senate approved the holy tome 19-8 Monday night, which could make Tennessee the first state to adopt the Bible as its official book, the Tennessean reports. Advocates of HB 0615 insist it doesn't violate either federal or state constitutional mandates on the separation of church and state, mainly because they're basing their nomination not on the Bible's religious import, but on its historical, cultural, and even financial significance (NPR notes the state's multimillion-dollar Bible-printing industry). "This book has done more to bring us to where we are today than any other book in the history of mankind," argued Republican Sen. Kerry Roberts, who said he was initially conflicted about whether to vote for the bill (he did). What held him, and some others, back: the idea of the Bible being trivialized next to other state symbols—including a Barrett M82 sniper rifle and a state song about two guys looking for moonshine, per the AP. "I hear Satan snickering," Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris noted last year, adding it would "dumb the good book down," per the Times Free Press. The director of ACLU-Tennessee tells the Tennessean that "privileging one religion over another not only tramples on the Constitution, it marginalizes the tens of thousands of Tennesseans who choose to practice other religions or not to practice religion at all." Haslam has signaled his own reservations. "The Bible is the most important book in my life, and I think in the world," he told reporters last week, the AP notes. "But that's very different than being the state's official book." He has 10 days to sign the bill or veto it once he receives it; if he does neither, it automatically becomes law. (The Ten Commandments were removed from the Oklahoma capitol.)

In interviews with reporters, Cuban officials say they have investigated thoroughly and cannot find the source of the mystery ailments. But they strongly reject the accusation, made by President Trump and other US officials, that Cuba is somehow responsible. "Our main concern at this moment are the accusations being made by the US government and we are focused on that because this is a slander," says Coronel Ramiro Ramirez. As for some kind of acoustic weapon: "It's impossible," Lieutenant Colonel Jose Alazo tells Reuters. "We are talking about science fiction." Cuban officials say they examined hotel rooms, conducted air and soil tests in the neighborhoods of diplomats' homes, talked to hundreds of neighbors, looked into whether insects might be to blame—and came away with nothing, reports NBC News. "Not even one person was sick," says a doctor. As for whether a third party such as Russia might be responsible, the officials say Cuba would never allow that on their territory, though Ramirez added, "We don't have definitive answers yet." One hindrance to the Cuban inquiry: The US has not provided access to victims' medical files or to homes where the illnesses occurred, and the officials called for greater cooperation on that front. The US has pulled most of its diplomats out of the country in the wake of the illnesses, though scientists outside of Cuba are similarly skeptical of a sonic attack.

Santorum was one of the foremost voices calling for Republicans to reject the treaty, and in the Daily Beast today he explains why, suggesting that, under the treaty, disabled children would have their fates decided by "a well-meaning but faceless and distant United Nations bureaucrat" rather than their parents. The US, he argued, "should be telling the UN, not the other way around, how to ensure dignity and respect for the disabled." Of course, proponents would say that's exactly what this was. The treaty was based on the Americans with Disabilities Act. The US "could have shown its leadership by ratifying the treaty," writes Michael Yudell of the Philadelphia Inquirer. Instead we got "nonsense" about the UN taking our sovereignty. "I’m curious whether these same Senators and other treaty opponents thought The X-Files was a documentary film." At the New York Times, Lawrence Downes calls it "a parting slap at Bob Dole," who arrived in a wheel chair and was greeted warmly by each Republican—before most voted against the treaty.

Yes, even Lindsay Lohan is apparently reminded of Lindsay Lohan when she reads about Bynes' troubles, as evidenced by this tweet from LiLo: "Why did I get put in jail and a nickelodeon star has had NO punishment(s) so far?" Shockingly, we have to agree with La Lohan on this one, although to be fair, Bynes has thus far avoided implication in any jewelry thefts. Lohan aired the sentiment shortly after news broke that Bynes—whose license is suspended—was pulled over yet again yesterday. Her car, at least, got impounded this time, E! reports. Prior to that, Bynes was photographed driving Thursday night with her face covered, which is probably about as safe as it sounds. But she insists she's fine and totally not crazy, TMZ reports. She also denies smoking pot while driving, and says the pipe she was pictured with in her car actually contained tobacco. Which sounds likely.

The agency says the Pavlof Volcano, which is about 600 miles southwest of Anchorage, erupted abruptly at 4:18pm local time. The agency says the eruption also led to tremors on the ground. The USGS has raised the volcano alert level to "Warning" and the aviation warning to "Red," the AP reports. The volcano, which is about 4.4 miles in diameter, has had 40 known eruptions and "is one of the most consistently active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc," the agency says.

Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton tells the Kansas City Star that his office served Ford, 38, with a protective order—given to Ford at the Excel Industries plant where he worked—that paints a dire picture of Ford's supposed mental state. "He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed," the complainant writes in all caps in the filing. "It's my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!" Walton wouldn't say who the complainant was, simply noting to KWCH that "I can't give you details, but it would be someone he was in a relationship with." The order was apparently placed in response to an incident that was said to have taken place between the complainant (who IDed herself as Ford's live-in girlfriend) and Ford on Feb. 5. In that complaint, the woman alleges she and Ford engaged in a verbal fight that soon turned violent and included Ford pushing and grabbing her and placing her in a "choke hold from behind" until she "couldn't breathe." She reported the alleged attack to police by phone on the 5th. Ford received the order at 3:30pm, and Walton said at a Friday press conference, per the New York Daily News, "He was upset but nothing greater than anybody else that gets served a [protection from abuse order]." Ford then left the factory; the first shots were reported at 4:57pm.

The AP reports that since April, a GoFundMe account set up to raise money to aid protesters has far surpassed the $5,000 its organizer had originally hoped it would reach: Over the past six months, more than 21,000 people have contributed to boost the fund to over $1 million. "It still feels unreal sometimes because it is such an astronomical figure to me," says Howaste Wikaya, a protester who set up the fundraising page. But Wikaya adds the money is spent practically the moment it's received: A local tribal historian tells the AP that only about $100,000 from the fund remained as of Friday night for the camp, situated near Cannon Ball where the Missouri and Cannonball rivers meet—and North Dakota's unforgiving winter is coming. Where the money has gone: groceries that run about $2,000 every two days, 20 yurts ($160,000 in total), and bail money (about $7,000 so far) for those arrested for protesting the $3.8 billion pipeline, which protesters say will disturb drinking water and plow through cultural artifacts of the nearby Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Per InsideSources, however, the protests have benefited from other fundraising as well—one effort has set aside more than $860,000 just for "the legal defense of warriors protecting land, water and human rights"—and some even claim donated supplies have been wasted. But donors continue to send financial support, including one New Hampshire woman from a community that fought its own natural gas pipeline. "This really, really struck a chord with me," she tells the AP. (CNN talks with some Standing Rock Sioux who protest the protest.)

"The initial determination was based on a flawed process," the source says, with investigators mistakenly thinking one email contained information from a top-secret report that "actually postdated the email in question." The State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community have clashed over whether the emails were classified or not and the source says the office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has ruled in the State Department's favor, though a Clapper spokesman says the review isn't over. The emails were not on the agenda when Clinton, Sanders, and Martin O'Malley appeared at MSNBC's First in the South Democratic Presidential forum in South Carolina on Friday night, moderated by Rachel Maddow, the Guardian reports. Instead, the candidates clashed over gun laws, the death penalty, campaign finance, and the Keystone pipeline. Sanders and O'Malley both accused Clinton of taking far too long to decide she was against the pipeline project, with Sanders calling opposition to transporting "some of the dirtiest fuel on this planet" a "no brainer," the Guardian notes. (Sanders has introduced the first Senate bill to legalize recreational marijuana across the US.)

Two days after House Republicans voted to release a memo regarding FBI surveillance and one day after President Trump was overheard saying he would release it, the FBI publicly came out opposing that plan. "We have grave concerns about the material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy," the FBI said in a statement Wednesday. The memo prepared by staffers for Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, concerns the role of the so-called Steele dossier in federal surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Last week, the Justice Department warned the House Intelligence Committee that releasing it would be "extraordinarily reckless." The intelligence community worries making the classified document public would inform foreign targets how to avoid surveillance. FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Chief of Staff John Kelly on Monday in an attempt to prevent the memo from being released. And Democrats say the memo picks and chooses information to cast doubt on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. Regardless, Kelly told Fox News Radio on Wednesday that the memo will be released "pretty quick."

And if there is one general who knows how to handle the media and the political process (skills that McChrystal obviously lacked), it is Petraeus."

Read the full text here. A quick survey of bloggers of all stripes finds them underwhelmed, in part because they don't see much hope of the president winning congressional approval on key parts: Ezra Klein, Washington Post: It's "not a very good plan," with the first part focusing on expanding domestic production of oil, "the very fuel we need to be weaning ourselves off of." And it doesn't get much better. "Obama needs to look presidential and solutions-oriented while Congress squabbles over the budget for the rest of 2011. On all those measures, this plan will very likely be successful. It just won’t do much for the planet." Economist: "It is hard to see his half-baked, reheated list of proposals as anything more than a reassurance to the environmentally-minded, and to Americans fretting about rising fuel prices, that the president feels their pain—unlike those nasty Republicans." Andrew Revkin, New York Times: "It’s a creditable speech, emphasizing the need for responsible extraction of natural gas and safe production of nuclear power. ... But there are 'same-old' lines on biofuels and no mention of the need for Americans, as a patriotic responsibility at the very least, to reconsider energy habits." Grist: On the ambitious goal of slashing oil imports: "It's hard to think of anything—short of an economic crash bigger than any ever seen in US history, or perhaps an alien race forcing all of us to take to our bicycles—that could conceivably accomplish such a goal."

In the London Review of Books, Hersh writes that the US didn't, as it has said, discover bin Laden's location through couriers. Instead, top Pakistani generals knew where bin Laden was—in fact, as Hersh puts it, "bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006," and a Pakistani official revealed the information for a large portion of a $25 million reward the US had put forward in 2001. Hersh bases his report largely on an anonymous source he describes as "a retired senior intelligence official who was knowledgeable about the initial intelligence about bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad." Obama did order the Navy SEALs raid on the compound, but it didn't happen the way the White House has said, Hersh writes. "There was no firefight as they moved into the compound," the source says. Bin Laden, who was an "invalid," was simply shot. Ensuing accounts, including President Obama's speech, provided inaccurate details. Though Obama acknowledged working with Pakistani intelligence, the account by John Brennan, now the CIA head, rejected the idea that Pakistan had any knowledge of bin Laden's location. Hersh's report is an "explosive" one, writes Seth Maxon at Slate, but he notes that its trustworthiness is uncertain, "since it mostly relies on the information of a single anonymous source—and because it doesn't appear in Hersh's usual venue for blockbuster investigative pieces, the New Yorker." Business Insider agrees that it "should be viewed with skepticism." Read it all here.

Though the film has some great visuals, it drags at times. And critics agree: Don't see it at 48 frames per second. It just looks too real. The film "is solid and acceptable instead of soaring and exceptional, one unnecessarily hampered in its quest to reach the magical heights of the trilogy," writes Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times. "There is just not enough story here to prevent things from getting pokey." On the other hand, with such great source material, "there is only so far wrong you can go." "The comparative playfulness of the novel could have made this Hobbit movie a lot of fun," notes AO Scott in the New York Times. Instead, "Tolkien’s inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle." Overscale indeed: We get six chapters of the book in three hours, writes Bob Mondello at NPR. "The filmmakers are reduced to detailing troll recipes and staging a hedgehog rescue." Your opinion of the film all depends on your comparison point, asserts Andrew O'Hehir at Salon. "If you arrive at The Hobbit via the flatulent mediocrity of most contemporary fantasy films and fantasy fiction, it looks pretty damn good," he notes. But if you're comparing it to the earlier films, you see a "sprawling, shambling, full-length prequel to (Peter) Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but not so much to Tolkien's." Meanwhile, Slate offers a different take on 48 frames per second.

It's the first time the percentage has cracked the 50% mark in almost 10 years of surveys, and caps a steady rise in polls from a low of 32% in 2004. What's more, majority support for same-sex marriage is no longer confined to people in their 20s: 65% of people in their 30s like the idea, up 23 percentage points since 2005, along with 52% of people in their 40s, a 17-point increase. It's good news, says liberal blogger Alex Pareene at Salon, but it probably won't make much difference to Republicans. "Because the people who don't support it really don't support it, and people who really care about opposing things make a pretty good base of political support." Click for his full column.

He was 88 and had been the world's longest reigning monarch, reports the AP. The Royal Palace said Bhumibol died "in a peaceful state" at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, where he underwent an operation over the weekend and had been treated over the past decade. During a reign that spanned 70 years, the US-born Bhumibol was the nation's one constant as myriad governments rose and fell, a gentle leader who used the throne's influence to unify the nation and rally troops through the Cold War as Thailand's neighbors fell under communist control. In his heyday, the frail, soft-spoken man in spectacles wielded so much power and respect, he could squelch coups and rebellions with a gesture or a few well-chosen words. Bhumibol was the world's richest monarch and one of the planet's wealthiest people: Forbes magazine estimated his fortune at more than $30 billion in 2011. Although not known for having extravagant tastes, he nevertheless lived the elite life of a modern-day king, racing yachts and appearing at official functions clothed in ornate golden robes. Over the last decade, the once vigorous Bhumibol had withdrawn from public life due to a series of illnesses. His wife, Queen Sirikit, has also long been ailing and has been even more rarely seen. Strong anti-defamation laws in Thailand make it a severe crime to speak ill of the king or the royal family, making it sometimes difficult for outsiders to gauge public opinion. However, NPR reports that the king's successor, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, is clearly less well-liked than his father. Thailand's PM says the government will observe a one-year mourning period and flags will fly at half-staff for 30 days. No government events will be held for 30 days, he added. The world's longest reigning monarch is now Queen Elizabeth II, who ascended to the British throne in 1952.

On the heels of the former VP candidate calling for President Obama's impeachment, 54% of voters say they've heard too much from Palin already and would prefer that she be less outspoken in political debates, according to an NBC News poll. While that balanced out to two-thirds of Democrats, it also included a majority of independents and 40% of Republicans. But Palin shouldn't feel terribly singled out; the poll found that voters would like these guys to shut up, too: Jesse Jackson, 51% Dick Cheney, 45% Newt Gingrich, 43% Al Gore, 40% Bill Clinton, 32% Palin's impeachment zinger has thus far found little support among the GOP, which may also fear it could drive Democrats to the polls in November. John Boehner said yesterday "I disagree" with those calling for Obama's impeachment, the Hill reports. And "while Mr. Obama's abuses of executive power are serious," they don't reach the level of impeachment, a Wall Street Journal op-ed notes. In fact, impeachment "at the current moment would backfire on Republicans" as it plays into the claim from Democrats "that GOP opposition to Mr. Obama is personal."

Constable Jarrod Singh of Toronto's Durham Regional Police Service was called to the scene of a fight Sunday night, CBC reports. He arrived to find eight people surrounding another person. Singh says he can see how someone mistook it for a fight; but the person in the center of the crowd was actually break dancing. It turns out the group were members of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology's dance troupe and were filming a music video. The dancers thought they were about to be shut down when Singh showed up. Instead, after talking with the group for a bit, Singh says he "decided it was time to bust a move," the Global News reports. The results, according to the Ottawa Citizen, were "amazing." The Facebook video of Singh breaking it down with one of the dancers has been shared more than 800,000 times. This wasn't the constable's first rodeo; before joining the police, he was a member of his college's dance troupe, which once opened for rapper Rick Ross.

Finally, Judge Gerald Chatham declared a mistrial due to a "hopelessly deadlocked" jury, though prosecutors immediately stated they intended to try Quinton Tellis again for capital murder, reports the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. According to prosecutors, phone records show 29-year-old Tellis, an acquaintance of Chambers, was with her around the time she was doused in gasoline and set on fire in Courtland, Miss., on Dec. 6, 2014. Defense attorneys, however, stressed that Chambers identified her attacker as "Eric" or "Derek" before she died, per WREG. Though USA Today reports Chambers' mouth was so badly charred that she mispronounced her own last name as "Tambers," Tellis' family urged authorities to "find Eric" as they celebrated the mistrial. Defense attorney Alton Peterson described the result as "very unusual," adding, "I've never seen it happen before," per WREG and CNN. After a week-long trial, jurors apparently believed only a guilty verdict required a unanimous decision; they returned with a split not guilty verdict even after the judge reminded them that a decision had to be unanimous. Peterson says his "great sense of relief" quickly evaporated. It's not yet clear when a new trial could take place. Tellis also faces charges in a separate murder in Louisiana and is serving time in prison for using credit cards belonging to that victim.

"A truck carrying what first seemed to be normal cans of the soft drink Pepsi was stopped, and after the standard process of searching the products, it became clear that the alcoholic beers were covered with Pepsi's sticker logos," a border official said. A tweet on the Saudi customs agency's page shows some photos of the busted brews. The Washington Post reports this isn't the first desperate attempt in Saudi Arabia to bring in some booze, noting a recent incident of a man who sewed 12 bottles of hooch into his pants. (An elderly UK man had faced 360 lashes for possessing homemade wine in Saudi Arabia—but he was recently released.)

Cuba's Foreign Ministry says the country's UN delegation has "voiced a strong protest" against Trump's "disrespectful, unacceptable, and meddling statements," Reuters reports. In his address, Trump slammed the Cuban regime as "corrupt" and "destabilizing" and said there was no chance of the US trade embargo being lifted until Havana brings in "fundamental reforms." Other reactions: "Trump's ignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times-not the 21st Century UN," tweeted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. "Fake empathy for Iranians fools no one." Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who was not present for the speech, called Trump "the new Hitler," the Independent reports. Earlier, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza responded to Trump's call for democracy to be restored in the country by saying: "No leader can come and question our democracy, can come and question our sovereignty." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave the speech a better review. "In over 30 years in my experience with the UN, I never heard a bolder or more courageous speech," he said. Trump, who warned that the US would "totally destroy" North Korea if necessary, was also applauded by South Korea, the AP reports. Trump set out a "firm and specific stance regarding the important issue of maintaining peace and security now facing the international community and the United Nations," said a spokesman for the country's presidential office. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom tells the BBC: "It was the wrong speech, at the wrong time, to the wrong audience." "This was a bombastic, nationalist speech," she says. "It must have been decades since one last heard a speech like that in the UN General Assembly." Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev said Trump painted Syria, Cuba, and Venezuela as "almost the worst dictatorships in the history of the humankind." He said that in the "contradictory" speech, Trump expressed support for nations' sovereign rights but mixed it with a "barefaced US pretense to determine who has such rights and who does not," the AP reports. (One US commentator believes Trump's speech bordered "on the threat of committing a war crime.")

Lohan was prohibited from driving while working on the movie, as required by the insurance policy taken out by the production company, sources tell TMZ. The insurance company was reluctant to issue the policy in the first place, seeing as how LiLo is not exactly what one would call reliable, so it set a bunch of conditions including banning the accident-prone Lohan from taking to the open road. The production company apparently didn't care that Lindsay was violating the ban by driving anyway … until she crashed, in full view of a production SUV that was following her, sources say. What does this mean for her? The insurance company reportedly hasn't tried to cancel the policy, but the production company is now cracking down on Lindsay's driving privileges. If you've somehow managed to avoid them until now, TMZ has photos of the wrecked Porsche.

The Washington Post calls the move “apparently unprecedented.” President Obama’s top lawyer had sought a deal and White House officials had delivered some 20,000 more pages of emails and other documents to investigators yesterday, while Democrats on the panel fought the decision; the vote nonetheless came down 14-9 along party lines. The communications requested involve Bill Daley and Joe Biden’s chief of staff Bruce Reed, as well as a broad selection of other senior aides including Rahm Emanuel, Valerie Jarrett, Larry Summers, and former Biden chief of staff Ron Klain. Rep. Cliff Stearns says he also wants to see the president’s relevant BlackBerry messages, Politico reports.

On the Republican side, Cruz scored an easy victory over Donald Trump and John Kasich, reports CNN. With 97% or results in, Cruz has 48%, Trump 35%, and Kasich 14%. On the Democratic side, Sanders comfortably defeated Hillary Clinton 56% to 43%. Wisconsin has 42 delegates at stake for Republicans, and even though it's not winner-take-all, the Cruz victory will be a boost in his quest to keep Trump from securing the necessary number of delegates ahead of the GOP convention. "Tonight is a turning point," Cruz told supporters after the race was called. "It is a rallying cry." He's winning, he added, because his campaign is uniting the Republican party. Sanders, meanwhile, can now boast of winning seven of the last eight contests, with delegate-rich New York up for grabs on April 19, reports Politico. In his own speech to supporters, Sanders emphasized the "momentum" of his campaign. "Real change never, ever takes place from the top on down," he said. "It always takes place from the bottom on up." For Democrats, 86 delegates were at stake on Tuesday. The AP reports that turnout was projected to be about 40% of eligible voters, the highest in a presidential primary in the state since 1980.

The 86-year-old former leader, who is often rumored to be dead or seriously ill, chatted with reporters and other voters in his first extended public outing since 2010, Reuters reports. Castro was stooped and spoke in a weak voice about issues including Hugo Chavez and his brother Raul's economic reforms. "The people are truly revolutionary, they have really sacrificed," Castro said, praising public participation in the elections. "We don't have to prove it, history will. Fifty years of the blockade and they haven't given in." Only Communist Party-selected candidates were on the ballot in the Cuban elections, which will send 612 delegates to the National Assembly, the BBC reports.

Demonstrators are climbing the tallest building in western Europe, London's 87-story Shard, to make their point. Safety personnel and police are watching after the team of six women began ascending the building via the roof of a nearby subway station. They're reportedly "free-climbing" the building; part of its exterior is built like a ladder, the BBC reports. The Shard is between the three headquarters of Shell, Greenpeace says, and it resembles a piece of ice. At the top, says a climber, "we'll try to hang a huge art installation ... that will make Shell think twice before sending their rigs into the Arctic." The climbers, who have been live-streaming the event via head-mounted cameras, are all highly trained, says a rep. Monitoring police say they got a call about the protest at 4:20 this morning, the Guardian reports.

Lumberyard's beta version dropped Tuesday, and the company frames its purpose like so: "Whether you are a major studio, an indie developer, a student, or a hobbyist, Lumberyard provides a growing set of tools to create the highest-quality games" and intersects with Amazon's cloud services (aka AWS) and its streaming video-game platform, Twitch. Scroll down past the legalese to Section 57.10 of the AWS ToS, updated Monday to cover Lumberyard, and you'll first see a standard-looking warning. The "Acceptable Use" language instructs users that Lumberyard isn't to be used with "life-critical or safety-critical systems" such as operating medical equipment or driverless cars. But there's an exception to that clause, and it gives users a pass if there are zombies afoot—a playful move that VentureBeat notes could "actually be good for business." "This restriction will not apply in the event of the occurrence (certified by the United States Centers for Disease Control or successor body) of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization."

When Herman Cain was asked about his earlier comments that he wouldn’t allow a Muslim in his administration, or that they should take an extra loyalty oath, Gingrich jumped in with an anecdote about the Times Square bomber, Think Progress notes. Asked why he’d violated his oath to the US, the bomber, in Newt’s telling, replied, “You’re my enemy. I lied.” “If you’re not prepared to be loyal to the United States, you will not serve in my administration, period,” Newt continued. “We did this in dealing with the Nazis and we did this in dealing with the communists.” Muslim groups were outraged, and political analysts were perplexed. “Either he is doing this for political purposes to distract people from a campaign in disarray, which is bad, or he actually believes it, which is scary,” ex-Bush strategist Matthew Dowd tells ABC.

And thanks to her adoptive mom's efforts, the Sith lord was there Friday in a Wilmington, Del., courtroom, as were a slew of Stormtroopers, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and even a family court judge dressed up like Princess Leia as the Star Wars theme song played, People reports. "I wanted this day to be everything she ever wanted," new mom Deanna Pedicone tells WPVI. "It's only once in a lifetime that she'll be adopted." The News Journal details the mother and daughter's path to becoming a family, starting when the unmarried Pedicone started out as a foster parent a few years ago. Just two weeks after getting licensed in November 2013, a nearly 2-year-old Zoe was placed with her. Their bond grew so great that Pedicone decided to pursue adoption, and her application was approved a few months ago. She says she was inspired to make her daughter's Star Wars-themed dream come true by a video of another little girl's adoption that featured a bevy of princesses. Pedicone recruited a local Star Wars costuming group and filled Judge Barbara Crowell in on her plans, and Crowell was happy to oblige, even dressing up as Leia Organa and touching Zoe's head with a lightsaber as she announced her official name change. Now Pedicone says she and Zoe can concentrate on their future together, something they were never fully able to do when Zoe was her foster child. "There are no more strings. … No more case workers. No more attorneys. It is just us," she says. (Carrie Fisher finished filming the next Star Wars movie before her death this week.)

A senior diplomat said fighters were trying to coax Gbagbo out of the bunker he's been hiding in. The diplomat also revealed that Gbagbo's closest adviser and longtime friend had abandoned him, leaving the bunker to seek refuge inside the French ambassador's home, reports the AP. The BBC reports that Gbagbo's rep told the AFP he is not yet ready to surrender. But the AP reports that Ouattara's ambassador to France said Gbagbo is negotiating exactly that, though he did not provide any details. "I'm not trying to be demagogical or to add to the disinformation, but according to the information that I have, he's negotiating his surrender because he has realized the end is near. The game is up," he said.

You're obligated to reply to any petition that gets enough signatures on the "We the People" site—even the one to deport Piers Morgan over his gun-control stance. What do you do? Well, you could issue a statement that never uses the words "Piers," "Morgan," or "deport," which is what the White House has done, New York reports. Instead, Jay Carney tactfully addresses the principle at hand, in a post titled, "When Discussing the Second Amendment, Keep the First in Mind Too." President Obama, he assures us, believes in the right to bear arms, but he also believes in freedom of speech. "No one should be punished by the government simply because he or she expressed a view on the Second Amendment—or any other matter of public concern." He then posts a video of Obama's generic response to post-Sandy Hook gun petitions. (Click to watch a much more animated Piers Morgan video.)

In an earnings call yesterday, the company shared a lower-than-expected forecast for the quarter ending in December, but it also shared this tidbit: Members of its loyalty program will be able to use a planned mobile ordering and payment app to request delivery in select cities in late 2015, the Wall Street Journal reports. "Our version of e-commerce on steroids" will give "the ability to create a standing order of Starbucks delivered hot to your desk daily," Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said during the call.

According to AFP, three of those arrested have been charged with attempted terrorist murder and participation in the activities of a terrorist group. The other nine were released. Officials say there was a need for "immediate intervention" as the suspects may have been planning an attack in Brussels to coincide with a Euro 2016 soccer match Saturday, Al-Jazeera reports. According to the AP, the European Championships are currently taking place in France, but people were gathering all over Belgium to watch Belgium take on Ireland on Saturday. There were no difficulties during the raids, and no weapons were found. "In the interest of the investigation, currently no further details can be given." NBC quotes a statement from the Belgium Federal Prosecutor’s Office as saying. The Belgian prime minister says the situation is "under control," though the country will remain under the second highest terror level. "It is not over," Belgium's interior minister tells the AP. "Something is still up." Belgium's soccer team ended up defeating Ireland 3-0 in its Euro match.

Gary Herbert signed into law a bill requiring anesthesia for patients who reach this mark, USA Today reports. The "Protecting Unborn Children" mandate is the first of its kind to pass in the US, rekindling a debate as to whether a fetus can feel pain at that point in the gestational cycle. (The Washington Post notes a review of more than 300 studies shows the fetus likely doesn't perceive pain before 28 weeks.) The governor "believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child," a spokesman for Herbert said in a statement. The law wouldn't apply in cases where anesthesia could hurt the mother, if the abortion was needed to save the mother's life, or if the fetus suffered from a congenital defect that would prove fatal, per the AP and USA Today. Other states have tried for similar laws and failed; a dozen states ban abortion after between 20 and 22 weeks, while others offer the option of anesthesia. Critics note the law could be applied in cases where labor is induced, such as with pre-eclampsia or when a woman's due date has passed. State Sen. Curt Bramble, who sponsored the bill, argues anesthesia is used in other situations in Utah, such as for convicts put to death and animals being put down, so this law simply maintains consistency. "We go to extraordinary lengths in Utah to prevent the pain of an individual sentenced to death," he says.

That's according to a Oct. 17 report by the Department of the Interior's inspector general, which found the unnamed employee used a government-issued computer to visit some 9,000 adult video sites, including many associated with Russian websites containing malware. That malware, linked to ransomware attacks and designed to steal data from infected devices, infiltrated the USGS network at the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center in South Dakota, reports TechCrunch. Nextgov reports the employee no longer works at the agency. Their "extensive history of visiting adult pornography websites" clashed with rules prohibiting the use of government networks to view pornography, agreed upon "several years prior to detection," the report notes. The employee also broke rules against connecting unauthorized devices to the computer. Videos were saved to a USB drive, and a personal Android cellphone also infected with malware, per the BBC. TechCrunch reports there were no threats to national security as the EROS Center, a satellite imaging facility monitoring land surface, doesn't operate classified networks. Still, auditors recommend USGS enforce blacklists of banned websites and do more to stop employees from connecting personal devices to government computers. (Ted Cruz once "liked" a porn clip, but then he called it a mistake.)

The 8,700-mile flight, set to begin in October, will take the full 18 hours heading west and 15 hours heading back to the States, making it the longest nonstop flight to or from the US. United already holds the current record for a US carrier—a 8,446-mile flight to Singapore out of San Francisco, per a press release—while Aussie airline Qantas tops that with a 8,576-mile route from Sydney to Dallas, per USA Today. (Qatar Airlines currently flies the world's longest route: 9,032 miles from New Zealand to Qatar.) The new United flight, which needs final approval by regulators, would also set a record for the longest regularly scheduled route on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Because of the drastic time difference created when crossing over the international date line in between the two countries, commuters heading toward Singapore will arrive there on paper two days later, while those heading east toward the US will actually feel like time-travelers: They'll take off from Singapore at 11am and "go back in time" to touch down in LA at 10:15am the same day. (United is probably better off sticking to the flight business instead of tweeting about chicken nuggets.)

A lawyer for the Death Row records founder tells the AP Knight accidentally ran over and killed a friend yesterday afternoon while trying to "escape" in his pickup truck after being attacked by two other men. But police give a different account of events to the LA Times, saying that after Knight argued with two men on the set of NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton, he followed them to Tam's Burgers around 3:30pm PST and ran them over. "Looks like he drove backwards and struck the victims and drove forwards and struck them again," a police spokesman says. "The people we talked to say it looked like it was an intentional act." CNN reports the man killed was Terry Carter, 55; TMZ describes him as an actor. The second victim has been named as Cle Sloan, 51, who TMZ reports appeared in Training Day. Police say the incident is being investigated as a homicide, not a traffic accident; Knight's bail has been set at $2 million. Knight—who was behind the wheel when passenger Tupac Shakur was shot dead in 1996—has a long history of legal problems, including an alleged camera theft for which he is on bail. His lawyer says he is confident that Knight, whose pickup was found abandoned in a parking lot hours after the incident, "will be totally exonerated." The Times notes it's not clear whether Knight had any "affiliation with the production" of the biopic.

So if you expected Kraft to hold his silence while Trump took on NFL players who kneel during the National Anthem, you expected wrongly: Kraft on Sunday released a statement that was harsher in tone than that of Commissioner Roger Goodell, saying he was "deeply disappointed by the tone of the comments made by the President. There is no greater unifier in this country than sports, and unfortunately, nothing more divisive than politics. I think our political leaders could learn a lot from the lessons of teamwork and ... working together toward a common goal. Our players are intelligent, thoughtful, and care deeply about our community and I support their right to peacefully affect social change." Meanwhile, another NFL owner who donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration engaged in what USA Today calls an "unprecedented show of unity with his team." Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan locked arms with players during the national anthem ahead of a game between the Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens Sunday in London. Numerous players from both teams knelt for the anthem—to draw attention to racial injustice and police brutality—two days after Trump said owners should fire "son of a bitch" players who do so. The early game in London was expected to kick off a day of similar protests in the NFL.

The ballistic missile went up about 3am Wednesday local time and flew east before coming down in the Sea of Japan. "We will take care of it," President Trump told reporters afterward, per CNBC, but he did not elaborate. Military analysts from the US and South Korea were still assessing the type and scope of the missile. More details and developments: An ICBM? One big question is whether it was a standard missile or one of the intercontinental variety capable of reaching the US. The answer wasn't immediately clear, but the initial assessment points to an ICBM, according to Pentagon spokesman Col Robert Manning, per Yonhap News Agency. Long flight: Early reports suggest the missile flew for about 50 minutes, which the Guardian reports would be a North Korean record. The Pentagon's Manning estimates it went about 620 miles, and it may have come down within 200 nautical miles of Japan's coast, reports the AP. There were conflicting reports on whether it actually flew over Japan, as previous missiles have done.

Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez has told Florida officials that the state's attempt to purge people it believes are noncitizens from the rolls needs to be cleared by the department to ensure it does not "endanger the ability of eligible US citizens to register to vote and maintain their voter registration," Talking Points Memo reports. Civil rights groups say Florida is using an inaccurate database that is removing eligible voters from the rolls. Florida says it has found 87 noncitizens on the rolls so far, though one person told he was a noncitizen turned out to be a Brooklyn-born WWII veteran, notes the Miami Herald. Florida's government has filed a federal lawsuit of its own, alleging that the Department of Homeland Security is illegally refusing to let the state access a federal database that would help it purge noncitizens from the rolls. "We can’t let the federal government delay our efforts to uphold the integrity of Florida elections any longer," Florida's secretary of state told reporters.

Going public was the "only way" to "change the system" that takes advantage of clients, he tells 60 Minutes. "The quickest way to make money on Wall Street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client," he says. He wasn't seeking "destruction" in the piece, he says; instead, he writes, he was concerned about the company he loved. Smith tells the AP his goal is to educate those who know little about the financial world. "If people are not educated about what the issues are, they're powerless," he says. What others are saying about the book: Though Goldman finds "no evidence whatsoever to support" Smith's claims, the book could have "a long-term effect on the firm" when it comes to hiring—if people believe Smith, writes Susanne Craig in the New York Times. Times reviewer James Stewart isn't convinced, noting that the book "fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions." The book may have been marketed well, but it doesn't contain much in the way of "bombshell revelations," writes Lauren LaCapra at Reuters. Reviewers haven't been impressed, with some suggesting it's a "misleading" read. Indeed, between interviews and the book, Smith seems to contradict himself on clients' sophistication, notes Nathan Vardi at Forbes. He tells the story, for instance, of a major client who noted that even though he didn't trust Goldman, he'd continue working with the firm.

Things didn't work out so well for Samsung the first time around; in this round, Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages—double its first payout—over accusations Samsung infringed on five of its patents on newer devices. It wants $40 for each device sold with features like "slide-to-unlock," universal search, and the ability to tap a number inside a text message to dial it. On the flip side, Samsung is accusing Apple of infringing on two of its patents. But the tech giant drawing a heavy portion of the case's attention is actually Google, the New York Times reports. To wit, the Wall Street Journal reports "the docket might as well read Apple Inc. v. Google Inc." That's because four of the features in the crosshairs are part of the Android OS, reports the Journal, which points out that "the stakes are higher" than they were in 2012, because the targeted patents relate to the iPhone 5 and Galaxy S3, which saw heavy sales. The Guardian notes that Apple can't attack Google directly because infringement only arises when the Android code is put into hardware, but Google engineers will likely take the stand in an effort to help Samsung defend itself. A Boston University law lecturer seems to think Google is fairly safe, noting that by the time the trial (pegged at lasting about a month) and appeals wrap up, newer devices will already have flooded the market. "To kill Android with a half-dozen patents just seems like a long shot."

Military officials say that Robert Bales acted alone, but some survivors spoke of seeing up to 20 soldiers, MSNBC reports. One 8-year-old girl says the shooter shot her father before shooting her in the leg while other men were present, holding lights. A woman whose husband was killed during the incident says there were up to 20 Americans pointing their guns at her. Hakim—who says US investigators tried to prevent her from speaking to child survivors—also spoke to the Afghan general whom President Hamid Karzai has assigned to investigate the killings. He told her that village elders believe several soldiers took part in the massacre, and they found the boot prints of three or four people. Other Afghans, however, say they only saw one soldier leave the base that night, CNN reports.

"That was wrong," says the IRS official in charge of tax-exempt groups. "That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. The IRS would like to apologize for that." She swears it wasn't politically motivated, but conservatives such as Mitch McConnell are demanding a fuller accounting, and various Tea Party groups want resignations to follow. Conservative groups have been complaining for more than a year of unfair treatment by the IRS, reports the Washington Post. The back story here is that scores of political groups filed for nonprofit status last year, a distinction that puts them under the authority of the IRS instead of the Federal Election Commission, reports Politico. (One of the advantages is that they can hide donors.) The IRS agents—described as "career employees" working out of Cincinnati who got assigned to look into the increase in applications—were investigating to see whether such groups were dabbling too much in politics to qualify as nonprofits. The agency issued another statement today saying it should have done a "better job of handling the influx of advocacy applications. Mistakes were made initially, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan rationale.”

The statement was one of a number of "outbursts" made by the accused Colorado Planned Parenthood shooter as prosecutors brought 179 charges against him, CBS Denver reports. Dear also stated: “You’ll never know the amount of blood I saw in that place.” And 9News notes he repeated the phrase "protect the babies" multiple times during the hearing. According to the AP, that phrase is similar to "no more baby parts," which Dear repeated during his arrest. The 57-year-old Dear is accused of killing three people and wounding many more on Nov. 27 during an attack on a Planned Parenthood location in Colorado Springs, the AP reports. According to CBS, the scores of charges brought against Dear Wednesday include murder. During the hearing, Dear refused a mental health evaluation and said he didn't want to meet again with his lawyer—Daniel King—who he accused of trying to "drug him all up" like the "Batman shooter," 9News reports. "I think the problem is obvious, judge," responded King, who previously represented the Aurora theater shooter. Dear's next court date is scheduled for Dec. 23. It is unclear if prosecutors will seek the death penalty.

Per Veterans of Foreign Wars estimates, the remains of as many as 5,300 could still be in North Korea. Now, as one of four key points President Trump and Kim Jong Un agreed to during their historic summit, those remains could be coming home, NPR reports. "The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified," says the statement released after Trump's summit with the North Korean leader. The US and North Korea worked together to recover 229 sets of American remains between 1996 and 2005 during a thawing of relations between the two countries, Fox News reports. The VFW had asked Trump to raise the issue during negotiations. Families "want the remains of their sons back," Trump said. "They want the remains of their fathers, and mothers, and all of the people that got caught into that really brutal war, which took place, to a large extent, in North Korea. And I asked for it today, and we got it." He said that though he asked at the last minute, Kim agreed "so quickly" and was "so nice" about it: "He understands it. He understands it."

A Change.org petition urging the Commission on Presidential Debates to have the former Daily Show host moderate one of the three major debates ahead of the general election is picking up steam and now has more than 130,000 signatures, CNN reports. Petition starter Mariel Waters says Stewart is a trusted and popular figure who has interviewed 15 heads of state and "scores of other political leaders from this country and around the world." "Many in the US believe Jon Stewart shares their worldview and values," the petition states, citing a Reuters poll that found more than 50% of Americans agree with him on "some or most" issues. Martin O'Malley, who would like to see the Democrats have more than six presidential debates, announced on Twitter last night that he has signed the petition. An O'Malley spokeswoman tells the Washington Post that the former Maryland governor is a Daily Show fan and that a "Jon Stewart-moderated debate would be more informative than the Trump-dominated GOP sideshow that's going unanswered, so he's game."

The civilization later recovered, but history would repeat itself just a few hundred years later, delivering a final blow, researchers explain in a PNAS study offering a clear chronology of the civilization's demise. It's based on 154 radiocarbon dates from charcoal samples along with data from ceramics at the site of Ceibal in Guatemala which show "similar patterns" of warfare around 75 BC and AD 735, reports the International Business Times. Each was followed by a period of political upheaval, the first of which led into the Preclassic collapse of AD 150-300. Ceibal then saw a population decline and many other Maya cities were abandoned. But with "the development of dynasties centered on divine rulership," the civilization soon after rallied as power centralized, say researchers at the University of Arizona. However, warfare returned a few centuries later, resulting in a new period of political instability. This one led into the Classic collapse circa AD 800-950, when Ceibal again experienced a population decline, according to a release. But this time, power splintered and the Maya were unable to recover. Archaeologists now hope to survey other Maya sites for similar patterns of decline that may show why the Classic collapse proved fatal. (This Maya pyramid hides two others.)

The report sparked an eight-hour search in Sacramento, complete with helicopters, the Sacramento Bee reports. In an interview with CBS 13, Vaughn began to cry as she pleaded for her daughter's safe return. “We’re just looking for her to bring her home,” she said. “Please.” Now, however, police say it was all an act. As it turns out, young Laprea Lee was safe and sound at the home of Antwan Holliday, Vaughn’s boyfriend, the whole time, KCRA reports. Vaughn, 43, and Holliday, 44, face felony and misdemeanor charges related to hiding the girl, filing a false police report, and obstructing police. Police say Vaughn staged the whole thing for revenge because she was upset that her daughter had been dropped off about 15 minutes early after a camping trip with the girl’s father, Don Lee, forcing her to rush home, per CBS. (The girl was dropped off by her grandfather.) Vaughn told police that when she arrived home, Laprea was nowhere to be found, and she accused the girl's father of taking her. Police say a tipster eventually told them that Laprea was with Holliday, leading to the ruse being discovered.

The hairy animals with long noses and an appetite for insects do sport "pocketknives" for front claws, AFP reports, which they typically put to use digging into anthills. In two separate incidents in Brazil, however, the 4- to 7-foot-long animals have dug into people instead, and the hunters who encountered them bled to death after being punctured in their thighs and upper arms; one man was hit in the femoral arteries. Both cases, one in 2010 and one in 2012, have just been described in scientific literature this month. "These injuries are very serious and we have no way of knowing whether it is a defense behavior acquired by the animals," one researcher says, adding that it's important to give the anteaters space. One estimate has their population down by about 30% in the past decade due to loss of habitat, wildfires, hunting, and roadkill, and they are now considered a vulnerable species. An expert in Brazil says she hopes the news of the incidents doesn't further threaten the animals: "We have a lot of problems with this species because people believe that (they) bring bad luck and kill the animal on purpose." Adding to the trouble: Anteaters have poor vision and are known for being easily startled.

Speaking in Spanish, Reuters notes that Benedict implored the crowd, "I beg you to continue praying for me and for the next pope." He triumphantly raised his arms outstretched to the crowd in his second-to-last Angelus blessing before leaving the papacy. A huge banner in the square read: "We love you." The appointment today is one of the most cherished traditions of the Catholic Church, and this moment is one of Benedict's last opportunities to connect with the Catholic masses. The pontiff will spend the rest of the week on a Lenten prayer retreat, reports the BBC.

Or, to be more specific, "F--- no, I'm not running for Senate," as the rocker put it himself on Howard Stern's SiriusXM radio show Tuesday, per the Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press "Are you f---ing kidding me? Who couldn't figure that out? I'm releasing a new album. I'm going on tour, too. Are you f---ing s----ing me?" He told Stern he was just drumming up publicity for his new album, due out Nov. 3.

An upper jawbone belonging to a human relative who lived in what is now Tanzania almost 2 million years ago has been discovered with scratches on its still-intact teeth, and scientists have a clear idea about how they were made: by a stone tool held in the Homo habilis individual's right hand. Why is that significant? Well, it represents the earliest known evidence of right-handedness among human relatives. The next oldest comes from the 500,000-year-old teeth of a Homo heidelbergensis individual, per National Geographic. Evidence also suggests Neanderthals were predominantly right-handed. In the case of Homo habilis, archaeologists think the teeth nicks came about thusly: The individual would have a piece of meat clenched in his teeth, and while he stretched it out with one hand, he used the other, dominant, hand, to cut it with a stone, explains Live Science. (It provides a graphic of what this looks like.) Occasionally, the stone would slip, and the direction of the resulting nicks suggests the right hand was the one used, a theory backed up in modern experiments. Few studies have analyzed Homo habilis teeth for such marks, but study author David Frayer of the University of Kansas hopes his research will encourage others to do just that. The discovery may also offer insights about when language first appeared since "language, handedness, brain laterality ... are all interrelated," he tells Mashable. (This is the oldest evidence of human cancer.)

A look at what the outcome means for both campaigns: One common theme: The virtual tie is an OK result for Clinton but an "ominous one" for Sanders, as this New York Times analysis argues. The thinking: Iowa Democrats are a white and liberal bunch, and Sanders should have done better. An analysis at the Week makes a similar case, with a headline referring to Sanders' "stinging defeat." If he can't win here, he's likely in big trouble in a national race, it notes. Vox has a much more optimistic take about Sanders' "remarkably strong" performance and chalks it up to young voters. Along those lines, John Cassidy at the New Yorker calls Sanders the night's "big winner." He "confirmed his capture of the Party's under-forty wing, which means trouble for Hillary Clinton"—especially if the rising Marco Rubio ends up as the GOP nominee. Politico has a glum analysis for Camp Clinton: When this campaign started, Iowa was supposed to be a resounding victory, not a "tentative first step." Clinton's "inability to ride a first-class ground organization to triumph underscores the candidate's weakness and the lack of a message that resonates with primary voters." A similar take at the Washington Post: Sanders did well with liberals, young voters, and independents, writes Karen Tumulty. "The photo finish showed that Republicans are not the only voters looking for qualities beyond experience and electability."

In a tweet late Friday—just before tweeting that he would be taking a break from Twitter—Musk responded to a question about his ill-fated tweet claiming he would take the company private, which resulted in $40 million in SEC fines and him stepping down as company chairman, reports Reuters. "Worth It," he tweeted. Given that the ink is barely dry on the SEC fines, Gizmodo thinks that Musk's plan to take a break from "(firing) off word salad at all hours of the day and night" for a while "doesn’t seem like such a bad long-term plan."

Brandon Bostian, 32, does remember being banged around in the crash and ultimately regaining consciousness and calling 911, but he has "no explanation" for what caused the accident, his lawyer says, adding that the Queens resident had "no health issues to speak of" before the crash and was not taking any medication. Bostian, who suffered leg injuries, a concussion, and a head injury requiring 14 staples, has given police a blood sample and his cellphone and is cooperating with investigators. Meanwhile, NTSB member Robert Sumwalt says that it appears from the train's data recorder that the train was indeed going 106mph before Bostian pressed the emergency brake, and was going 102mph by the time the recording ended three seconds later. As earlier reported, the speed limit before the curve where the train derailed is 70mph; at the curve, the limit goes down to 50mph. And Sumwalt offers this devastating sentence to the New York Times: "We feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred." He's talking about technology called "positive train control," which can automatically slow or even halt trains to stop accidents. It's in place on parts of the Northeast Corridor, but not the portion of the track where the derailment occurred. Congress mandated that it be installed everywhere by the end of this year, but due to challenges getting it in place, the deadline could be extended to 2020. "Clearly it was reckless in terms of the driving by the engineer. There's no way in the world he should have been going that fast into the curve," Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter tells CNN. But Sumwalt says the NTSB will "get the facts before we start making judgments," noting that a mechanical problem like faulty brakes could be to blame.

Some 25 students started Jackson County Spelling Bee's championship round on Saturday, but after just 19 rounds, 11-year old Sophia Hoffman and Kush Sharma, 13, were the only two left standing for what an organizer says was a "legendary" showdown, the Kansas City Star reports. They spelled words including "scherzo,” "fantoccini," and "intaglio" correctly before the words ran out and organizers decided to halt the contest instead of plucking random words from the dictionary, reports the AP. The showdown will resume on March 8, and it will be a tougher challenge for both contestants: They will have to spell words taken anywhere from the Merriam-Webster dictionary's 1,664 page instead of from the Scripps-approved list of 300 words. The winner will move on to the National Spelling Bee in May.

The Army psychiatrist, who called the beard a "deeply sincere" symbol of his Islamic faith, began growing it after killing 13 people in the November 2009 shooting. An Army spokesman says Hasan was shaved at the prison, where officials had previously said he would be subject to military grooming regulations, the AP reports. But that doesn't seem obvious to Hasan's former civilian lawyer, who tells ABC News that he plans to sue over the shaving. "Forcibly shaving him after a military council approved the beard for the duration of the trial smacks of retaliation by Army officials," John Galligan said. "This was a vindictive act." Galligan says he'll consult with other lawyers, and then probably file a federal suit. Authorities also tell ABC that, given military regulations, a video of the shave must exist.

A fellow student is in custody, and police think a specific dispute between the two of them led to the shooting. Also of note: Police say an armed school resource officer—of the type the NRA is pushing—disarmed the suspect minutes after the shooting, though he happened to be off-duty at the time, reports AP. The school had metal detectors, and authorities are trying to figure out how the small-caliber handgun apparently got through them. The shooting reportedly took place outside in a school courtyard. "Gun violence in and around our schools is simply unconscionable and must end," said Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. "Too many young people are being harmed, and too many families are suffering from unimaginable and unnecessary grief."

Bachmann, who announced her candidacy during the debate, was "at ease and forceful without looking at all crazy or out-of-control," writes EJ Dionne Jr. at the Washington Post. Romney, meanwhile, "did not lose anything," he notes, "which means that, since he leads in the polls in New Hampshire, he is a kind of winner." Romney "couldn't have scripted an easier debate for himself, writes Alexander Burns and Maggie Haberman at Politico. He went in "looking strong and emerged from it stronger, as his opponents repeatedly passed up opportunities to go on the attack—and even inflicted damage on themselves as they tried to avoid confrontation." The real winner was the Tea Party, concludes Ronald Brownstein at the National Journal. All seven hopefuls appeared to be "operating in a policy framework shaped by the Tea Party push to retrench government," and none of them—not even Newt Gingrich—directly criticized Rep. Paul Ryan's plan for Medicare reform, he notes. Bachmann deserves the "most improved" medal for her performance, but all seven candidates were winners in their own way, according to Juli Weiner at Vanity Fair. Tim Pawlenty deserves the "least willing to insult Mitt Romney" award, while Herman Cain wins "most conspicuously overshadowed by Michele Bachmann," and Rick Santorum scores for "nicest blue tie," she writes.

The lack of evidence "doesn't mean something terrible didn't happen," said the police chief.

A jury this summer found that Samsung had knowingly infringed on Apple's patents, but that's not sufficient grounds for a ban, Judge Lucy Koh says. Instead, Apple would have to prove "irreparable harm" by demonstrating that customers were choosing specific Samsung devices over the Cupertino company's own, Forbes reports. Koh also noted that just "a small fraction" of Apple's features suffered infringement, and "it does not follow that entire products must be forever banned from the market," Reuters reports. Apple is likely to appeal the move, Forbes notes. In better news for the US firm, Koh nixed Samsung's call for a new trial over jury bias—leaving the $1.05 billion ruling in place, Mashable notes. Meanwhile, Samsung is ditching its bids for injunctions against Apple in Europe, where the European Commission in January planned an antitrust probe over Samsung patents. "We strongly believe it is better when companies compete fairly in the marketplace, rather than in court," the company said in a statement to the Verge.

Microsoft has just released the public beta version of a new Project Oxford tool that uses artificial intelligence to recognize "eight core emotional states" on people's faces in photographs. If you express anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or surprise and you show it, the tool will catch on, reports Microsoft; the eighth state it registers is "neutral." Project Oxford has been working on machine-based learning for a while now, reports Ars Technica. There's even a Movember-related sub-service, MyMoustache.net, through which users can upload images of their mustaches and get rated. Several users are already tweeting out the results of their own photos or those of famous people, reports the New York Daily News. For instance, one image of Hitler is calculated as mostly neutral (0.82048) but with smaller amounts of sadness (0.10757) and anger (0.07123) and trace amounts of contempt, disgust, fear, and surprise. The smiling cat owner next to him in the tweet, meanwhile, is 100% happy. Not all examples appear to get it exactly right, however; a forlorn-looking Keanu Reeves (aka "Sad Keanu") on a bench is only 0.01831 sad and actually 0.00035 happy, reports the Verge. (Still, it's looking better than Microsoft's age-guessing algorithm from earlier this year.)

Just this week, Republicans in at least four states introduced legislation restricting abortion, the New York Daily News reports. In Michigan, for instance, 23 Republicans this week co-sponsored a version of the transvaginal ultrasound bill that proved so divisive in Virginia. Last night Michigan's Republican House speaker said he wouldn't pass the bill, MSNBC reports. "I have absolutely no interest in forcing women to have a transvaginal ultrasound," he said. But Michigan is hardly alone. A bill in Tennessee would require women to undergo a standard ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion; another in Alabama could regulate its remaining clinics out of business; and a pair in Arkansas would forbid some insurance coverage for abortions and ban them entirely after 12 weeks. Publicly, DC Republicans say these state efforts won't damage the national brand. But "it can muddy the message the national party is trying to develop," one former House GOP strategist admits.

Of course, it wasn't until the Daily Mail got hold of it that the story took off, with this slightly revised headline: "Bad news for 220-mile high club: Researchers find sex in space could lead to life-threatening illnesses." This led to a spate of sex-in-space-can-kill-you stories. So what gives? It turns out that amorous space travelers probably don't have to worry—unless they're having sex for the specific purpose of producing offspring, explains Daily Kos. Essentially, the researchers studied plant sex in zero gravity and found big problems in the reproduction process related to how cells communicate with each other. They did not draw any conclusions about human sex, but the possibility of similar problems affecting people can't be ruled out yet, says LiveScience. "What does this mean?" asks Daily Kos. "It means we may not be able to colonize the Moon or Mars anytime soon, not until we lick many, many problems." But at least the couple who might be blasting off to Mars should be able to ... unwind.

Are you one of the last remaining M. Night Shyamalan fans? Well, then we have some bad news, because After Earth appears to be a train wreck of epic proportions. But if you just love reading snarky movie reviews, then the news is good indeed. Here's what people are saying: "Is After Earth the worst movie ever made?" asks Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. Heck, "it doesn't seem like a movie at all, but a sermon." Will Smith's character endlessly pontificates at his son, uttering his "almost literally unspeakable dialogue" very .... very .... slowly … for … some … reason. "I've never seen a movie that moves so slowly, or takes itself so seriously." By the end "you’re actively cheering for a teenage kid to get eaten by a tiger," writes Laremy Legel at Film.com. "I didn't plan to feel this way … but you did this to me, After Earth," by making your characters so horrifically unlikeable—one's a jerk, the other's a "nincompoop." The story, meanwhile, "stupefies us with nonsense, such little thought and logic went into this idea that it can’t even be considered a rough draft." Lou Lumenick at the New York Post gives it one star, and it's only getting that much "because Smith's longtime enablers at Sony apparently encouraged him to whittle this humorless sci-fi epic down from a much longer movie." Even now, the movie is likely to put you to sleep. After this (and his last decade of duds), "director M. Night Shyamalan would be lucky to get a gig directing traffic." But Dana Stevens at Slate cuts the film a tiny amount of slack. "Once you accept the elemental simplicity of After Earth’s plot ... you can stop resenting the movie for all the things it’s not (a rollicking summer actioner, a typical Shyamalan twist-based narrative)," she writes. And "there's a compelling creepiness to this quasi-mythical quest tale." But Jaden Smith simply isn't ready to "carry an entire action movie on his slender shoulders."

Blamed by some Instagram followers for ex-boyfriend Mac Miller's death on Friday, the 25-year-old disabled comments on her social media feed, reports People. Commenters hurled lowballs like "You lowkey evil," "Damn u killed the homie," and "I HOPE YOURE [sic] HAPPY WITH PETE [Davidson]," according to a tweet from Pop Crave. Grande has kept mum about the rapper's death, posting only a quick video of her UK hotel room with the words, "Bye London." The "No Tears Left to Cry" singer has been down this road before, when Miller was arrested in May for a DUI following his breakup with Grande. Naturally, some blamed her for his behavior. "I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be," she wrote on Twitter at the time. "I have cared for him and tried to support his sobriety and prayed for his balance for years (and always will of course) but shaming/blaming women for a man's inability to keep his s— together is a very major problem." Miller blamed himself for the DUI, per People, but that didn't stop some from criticizing Grande this time around. Now it seems the Twitterverse is on her side: "I hope Ariana has a strong support systems [sic] because the locals are intent on blaming her for something she has no business being blamed for ... AGAIN," reads a sample tweet. "Wishing you nothing but peace and strength." Miller died of a suspected drug overdose.

Authorities have rounded up thousands alleged to have been involved in the coup, in which at least 208 government supporters and 24 coup plotters were killed. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has refused to rule out bringing back the death penalty. The purging of thousands of alleged coup plotters raised tensions Monday between Turkey and the West, with US and European officials urging restraint while Ankara insisted that Washington extradite an exile accused of orchestrating the plot, the AP reports. As Western officials expressed alarm at the rapid roundup of so many by their key NATO ally, Turkish government officials explained that the plotters in the military had been under investigation and launched their ill-planned operation out of panic. The government claimed the swift move against so many reflected the prior investigation of those with links to moderate cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former Erdogan ally who lives in exile in Saylorsburg, Pa. (Erdogan's plane had "trouble in the air" during the coup attempt.)

A video of the incident posted Monday has more than 1.6 million views and includes the lines, "Just give me some f---ing bacon jalapeno mac and cheese" and "I'm very hungry, man." Luke Gatti—who was being denied mac and cheese because he was allegedly intoxicated and carrying a container of alcohol, which is against campus policy—also hurls slurs and gets physical with workers at the campus eatery in the nine-minute video before finally being taken down by one of the workers and then arrested as he yells, among other things, "Let me get my shoes. What the f--- happened to my shoes?" He was charged with trespassing and breach of peace, the Hartford Courant reports; other students have been tweeting that he was also expelled.

It's good news for Lehman's many creditors, but not great news considering the collapsed investment bank owes hundreds of billions. Lehman's has another auction next week, this time at Christie's. The Sotheby's sales actually exceeded expectations, notes LindsayPollack.com. Of the 142 lots, 83% found buyers. The top seller was Julie Mehretu's Untitled 1, which went to a private bidder for a little more than $1 million, while Liu Ye’s The Long Way Home went for $962,500. Both sold for significantly higher than expected. One of the unlucky ones was Damien Hirst's We've Got Style. Expected to be top dog at up to $1.2 million, it opened at $200,000 and found zero takers.

A man in Essex, England, appeared terribly excited to take delivery of his new $313,000 McLaren 650S sports car (a "supercar" that Jalopnik notes can hit 100mph in under six seconds) last week, and neighbors spotted him downing some bubbly to commemorate the occasion, the Telegraph reports. But a mere 10 minutes later (10 minutes!), the car was "reduced to a mangled lump of carbon-fibre and metal," as the paper puts it.

Now Exeter University in South West England has apologized after sending a mass email to staff and students quoting former general Erwin Rommel, USA Today reports. "One cannot permit unique opportunities to slip by for the sake of trifles," reads the quote, apparently spoken by the general in his North African campaigns against British troops, per the BBC. Seems the June 4 email aimed to inspire students to seek out career options. A university spokesman blamed a staff member who didn't recognize Rommel's name. "A member of staff used the public, free access website 'Quotefancy' to find a quotation for use as part of an internal email," says the spokesman. "Unfortunately, the staff member did not recognize the name attributed to the generated quote." (And to be fair, there is debate among historians about how much Rommel endorsed the Nazi regime.) The Exeter student newspaper the Falmouth Anchor, which broke the story, says "it is evident that there was no malicious intent in choosing the quote," but Fox News says the National Union of Students isn't taking it lightly. Jewish students feel "increasingly unsafe" at universities and avoid some schools over "fears of anti-Semitism," the group says, adding that "Exeter must take appropriate action to rectify the damage" and make sure "something like this will never happen again."

The Omaha World-Herald reports the unnamed 53-year-old man's adult children left their marijuana brownies in the back of his car. He found them Tuesday night and—unaware they were special—ate four. He started getting "bad anxiety" while watching TV, and his wife called 911. Paramedics determined the man was OK apart from his behavior: He was, as the World-Herald puts it, "crawling around on the floor, randomly using profanities, and calling the family cat 'a bitch.'" He said he felt like he was "tripping." Paramedics put the man to bed, and no charges were filed. Marijuana Politics points out minor marijuana possession hasn't been an arrestable offense in Nebraska since the 1970s.

Some 15 employees of Four Star Resolution have been charged with fraudulently collecting $31 million, NBC News reports. An indictment states that the firm's "elite" team used "particularly aggressive and egregious tactics," including sending fake legal documents, "in attempting to trick consumers into paying debts." In some cases, collectors tried to squeeze more money out of the victims than they owed, according to the indictment. US Attorney Preet Bharara says the firm took "ruthless advantage of the desperate situation in which the victims found themselves." Court papers describe how the firm's collectors told victims or their relatives that failing to pay debts was a felony and threatened to do things like issue arrest warrants and suspend driver's licenses, reports the Buffalo News. According to court papers, some of the money collected funded the gambling habit of the collection agency's owner, as well as cosmetic surgery for his wife, NBC notes. Four of the 15 employees have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, the News reports.

Under the Demographics Unit, later renamed the Zone Assessment Unit, plainclothes officers would infiltrate Muslim gathering places to learn what they could. The New York Times offers a snapshot: "Detectives were told to chat up the employees at Muslim-owned businesses and 'gauge sentiment' about America and foreign policy. Through maps and photographs, the police noted where Albanian men played chess in the afternoon, where Egyptians watched soccer and where South Asians played cricket." After the AP broke the story in 2011, civil rights groups pressured the city to end the program, which never generated a single crime lead. Arab-American groups complained that the only thing it accomplished was to sow distrust between its members and police. The program had been largely inactive since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office this year, and today he announced that it was done for good. “Our administration has promised the people of New York a police force that keeps our city safe, but that is also respectful and fair,” said the mayor. Two federal lawsuits against the city over the surveillance remain in the works.

In terms of getting the pipeline built, the vote doesn't mean much, observes the New York Times. But in terms of the Senate runoff in Louisiana, it looms large. The House measure approved today (as expected) was sponsored by Republican Bill Cassidy, who faces Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in that Dec. 6 runoff, reports the Washington Post. Both favor the pipeline and are trying to impress the voters back home. Landrieu's test comes Tuesday, when the Senate votes. If she can get 60 votes to avoid a filibuster, the measure goes straight to President Obama's desk. As of now, it's uncertain whether she'll succeed, and even if she does, President Obama seems all but certain to veto it, reports Politico. The Hill agrees, citing Obama's "strong signals" that he wants to wait for a federal review to be completed. It adds that a veto "could deal a blow to Landrieu's chances in the runoff." For the record, the House vote was 252-161, with 31 Democrats joining Republicans. Every Republican voted in favor, except for libertarian-leaning Justin Amash of Michigan.

Van Rensburg added that Carice Stander, the daughter of the property manager, said Pistorius had called her and her father for help taking Steenkamp to the hospital. Stander and Pistorius had used the bags and towels to stop the blood, she said. The commander described following "the trail of blood up the stairs," where the bathroom door was locked.

While not explicitly detailing those mistakes, Brinker acknowledges that many people felt that "the swift reaction" to Komen's defunding of Planned Parenthood was "an indicator of something larger and more dangerous ... the feeling that women's health care is being sacrificed on the altar of political ideologies." "If I have learned nothing else from our experience of the past week," Brinker continues, "it is that we in women’s health organizations must be absolutely true to our core missions, and avoid even the appearance of bias or judgment." In response to Quinn's pointed observation that as "the face of the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation ... it is up to you, not a PR firm to get out in front" and do damage control, Brinker vows a return to Komen's basics—"the funding of cutting-edge science"—and says the group "must now rebuild the trust that so many want to have in us."

Umm Sayyaf, a 25-year-old Iraqi woman captured in the raid that killed Abu Sayyaf, is accused of taking part in the kidnapping of Mueller, who was "owned" and sexually abused by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, NBC News reports. Federal prosecutors filed charges Monday against Sayyaf, who was transferred to Iraqi Kurdish custody a few months after her capture and is currently in prison in Iraq. Sayyaf has been charged with providing support to ISIS, which authorities say contributed to Mueller's death in ISIS custody. According to court papers, Sayyaf and her husband sold and traded women to ISIS fighters, and she was in charge of the captives when her husband was away. The court papers state that Sayyaf threatened to kill Mueller and two Yazidi women she was being held with, calling them "infidels" and showing them gruesome ISIS propaganda videos. Mueller died a year ago, and the Guardian reports that the court papers offer new details about her captivity. The 26-year-old was captured by ISIS fighters in August 2013, on her second day in Syria, and was kept in prison until September 2014, when she was turned over to the Sayyafs, according to federal investigators.

Here’s the weird part: the girl died this January. Authorities say Christopher Byrd violently shook the 11-month-old daughter of his girlfriend, whom he lived with in La Habra, Calif., until she fell unconscious while he was looking after the child on Jan. 12, 2005, report the Los Angeles Times and Orange County Register. Police say he then ran to a neighbor's house to call paramedics. For the next 10 years of her life, Savannah Quake remained in a vegetative state, having suffered a traumatic brain injury. Authorities say her death on Jan. 17 of this year was directly related to Byrd's actions. In 2007, Byrd pleaded guilty to charges of child abuse and possessing methamphetamine related to the incident in 2006 and was sentenced to four years in prison, reports the New York Times, but Savannah's death allows for new charges, authorities say. Byrd—who's already serving nearly nine years in prison for drugs and theft—is scheduled to be arraigned on charges of murder and felony assault on a child on Dec. 4 and could face 25 years to life if convicted.

A group called the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan recently registered with the US Federal Election Commission as a super PAC, and while Ryan's press secretary initially only said the speaker was "flattered but not interested," his team is now taking things further. On Thursday, Ryan's political operation is sending the group a cease-and-desist letter, Reuters reports. The Committee's intent was to convince Ryan to jump into the presidential race, not a surprising mission considering how often Ryan's name has been mentioned by establishment Republicans seeking an alternative to Donald Trump. The group has been trying to get a million signatures on its online petition to draft Ryan into the race. The cease-and-desist letter tells the organization to stop giving any indication it is raising funds to assist with a hypothetical Ryan campaign, and says, "We believe the actions of your organization are not in compliance with federal law and may constitute fraudulent solicitation of funds." It was sent to the group's treasurer, but a spokesperson for the group tells Reuters it has not yet been received. "The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan is simply a patriotic effort to save our party and save our country," he adds.

NOAA surveyed the Atlantic Coast using sound waves and found at least 570 methane "seeps" from Cape Hatteras to Nantucket, right where the continental shelf meets the ocean, LiveScience reports. They found the methane in two forms depending on the seeps' depth—most are between 800 and 2,000 feet, reports the New York Times. Shallow seeps are coming from burping microbes, but deeper down it turns into a sludge called methane hydrate that releases the gas when it's warmed, the BBC explains. The find is odd because methane seeps usually occur in "tectonically active" spots; the quiet East Coast is "cold, old, and boring," says study co-author Carolyn Ruppel, who adds that "we're setting the stage for a decade of discovery." Methane is a greenhouse gas, and the seeps could serve as a lab for studying climate change and its potential effects. The seeps aren't causing environmental concern—one expert says the amount of methane released is "probably on the order of a feedlot" and is dissolving in the ocean. In a biological side note, scientists have also found new life near the seeps—chemosynthetic creatures that get energy from chemical reactions and not the sun. LiveScience has photos of the methane seeps here.

Petkanas started to relay the story of a 10-year-old Mexican girl with Down syndrome who'd been separated from her mother, and in the middle of his narrative, Lewandowski jumped in with what the Washington Post calls a "dismissive trombone-like sound effect": "Womp womp," Lewandowski eyerolled, which immediately stopped Petkanas in his tracks. "Did you say 'womp womp' to a 10-year-old with Down syndrome?" said Petkanas, who on Twitter called it a "surreal moment." "How dare you! How dare you!" Petkanas lashed out at Lewandowski. "How absolutely dare you, sir." Backlash against Lewandowski online was immediate, with choice descriptors of him including "sociopath," "monster," "inhumane," and "ambulatory psychotic." "There is a word for that," CNN anchor Don Lemon said after showing viewers a clip of Lewandowski's diss. "That word is disgraceful." Time notes the child he mocked has been sent to a detention facility in McAllen, Texas, with her brother, while their mother was sent to Brownsville, about an hour away.

The White House tells the Fact Checker blog at the Washington Post that he's relying on reports "from BBC, Heat Street, New York Times, Fox News, among others.” After an analysis, the Post finds that the two most important ones are from the right-leaning Heat Street and the BBC. (Other reports have cited an article at Breitbart News, but it relies on the Heat Street piece.) The two articles say that US intelligence officials went to the FISA court (which deals with intelligence matters) because they wanted to investigate possible activity between two banks in Russia and a computer server in Trump Tower (which, to make matters more confusing, might actually be located in Philadelphia). Excerpts: Heat Street: “Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia.” BBC: It says Justice Department lawyers went to the FISA court. "Their first application, in June, was rejected outright by the judge. They returned with a more narrowly drawn order in July and were rejected again. Finally, before a new judge, the order was granted, on 15 October, three weeks before election day." The Fact Checker's assessment? Even if the stories are accurate, and that hasn't been confirmed, they do not say that President Obama was behind the request. Plus, they involve a computer server, not the tapping of phone lines. And, finally, they "do not back up the administration’s revised claim of politically motivated investigations." As a result, Trump gets the blog's worst rating of Four Pinocchios.

Police in Romania say they arrested 40-year-old Marcel Lazar Lehel this morning at his home in Arad, reports Romania-Insider. Guccifer is probably best known in the US for hacking into the emails of the Bush family and showing the world George W. Bush's paintings (including one of himself in the shower.) Media reports in Romania say "US services" helped with the arrest. The Bush family was far from the only target. Think Colin Powell, Tina Brown, Steve Martin, Mariel Hemingway, the Rockefeller family, and Carl Bernstein, to name but a few. He "hacked everyone from high-level military officials to C-list actresses with equal gusto," notes the Washington Post. Guccifer even snagged the script for the finale of the fourth season of Downton Abbey well before it aired in the UK, the Smoking Gun reported earlier this month. He also got into the account of the head of Romania's intelligence service.

In fact, the more time a person spends reading, the less likely they are to die. Researchers asked 3,635 people over 50 about their reading habits, then checked back in after 12 years. They found reading books for up to 3.5 hours per week—or an average of 30 minutes per day—lowered a person's risk of death by 17%, reports the New York Times. People who read books for more than 3.5 hours per week enjoyed a 23% lower risk of death. Researchers say books encourage "cognitive engagement" and "promote empathy, social perception, and emotional intelligence, which are cognitive processes that can lead to greater survival," per the Guardian. People who read newspapers and magazines also had a "survival advantage" over people who didn't read at all, but it was significantly less than with book readers, who were predominantly female, college-educated, and earning a high income. "Books engage the reader's mind more—providing more cognitive benefit, and therefore increasing the lifespan," a researcher explains. Overall, 33% of non-readers died after 12 years, compared to 27% of book readers. Book readers also lived two years longer than non-readers on average. "These findings suggest that the benefits of reading books include a longer life in which to read them," researchers say, per UPI, urging people to pick up a book rather than the remote. (This generation is said to read the most.)

The Australian government has blocked the $350 million sale of parcels of land totaling almost 40,000 square miles, citing national security issues relating to one of the enormous cattle ranches involved, reports the Guardian. The Anna Creek cattle station, which covers more than 3,000 square miles, borders South Australia's Woomera military weapons testing range. The government noted that the area up for sale covers 1.3% of Australia's landmass, and 2.6% of its agricultural land. A spokesman for S. Kidman and Co., which had been weighing bids from two Chinese companies, says he's surprised by the government's objection. "To be honest, I didn't think this would be the outcome," he tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. "I knew there would be concerns; however, cyber-espionage around the world seems to operate quite successfully in its own right without the need to acquire an Outback cattle property like Anna Creek."

Still, no ground assault took place, though reservists stand at the ready and armored vehicles are massed at the border. The Israeli airstrikes hit the office of the Hamas prime minister, who wasn't there at the time, and a spokesman for Benjamin Netanyahu explained the rationale for moving beyond pure military targets to government buildings. “It is clear that Hamas itself makes no distinction between its terrorist military machine and the government structure and that they are intertwined," he said, reports the New York Times. In four days of fighting, Al Jazeera says 39 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed. President Obama spoke with Netanyahu last night and "reiterated US support for Israel's right to self-defense and discussed possible ways to scale back the conflict," according to AP. Obama also called Egyptian leader Mohammed Morsi, and the White House said the president praised Morsi's efforts to ease tensions, without offering specifics.

Instead, her fashion business partner is introducing her to artists. But for now, she's enjoying the single life with "absolutely no plans on dating anytime soon," a source says. But, another source adds, "She’s been saying now that if she does date anyone, it could be someone who works in the arts world. Katie’s more interested in the quiet life now and an unassuming artist would fit the bill perfectly for when she’s ready." Then again, British magazine Grazia claims ex-fiance Chris Klein himself has actually been sneaking in to Katie's buildings for visits, Australia's News Network reports. "Chris was a real ladies' man when they were first together … he also had a major problem with alcohol," a source says. "He’s really cleaned himself up since then ... Katie likes the new Chris a whole lot more." Of course, all of this comes soon after fellow ex Jackson revealed Holmes called him up after her divorce…

You can't,” he writes on the Huffington Post. In light of that stark fact, he also has some advice for Sheen: “Take a nap. Get a shower. Call Chuck. Go on Letterman and make an apology. And then beg for your job back.” Baldwin can speak to all this because he had his own run-in with a studio executive, back when David Kirkpatrick bounced him from the sequels to The Hunt for Red October, an experience he recounts in detail in the HuffPo piece. From that, Baldwin learned that the entertainment industry is “the rock under which you find the biggest, lyingest, thievingest scumbags on Earth.” And “when you are as big a douchebag as some of these guys are, they have no choice but to snuff you,” Baldwin concludes. “Sober up, Charlie. And get back on TV, if it's not too late. This is America. You want to really piss off Chuck and Warner Brothers and CBS? Beg for America's forgiveness. They will give it to you. And then go back. You are a great television star. And you've got the gig.” One last piece of advice: “PS ... buy Cryer a really nice car.” (Click to see why Sheen’s lawsuit is not without merit.)

McCain on Moammar Gadhafi: He still poses a "direct threat." He's committed acts of terror, and he is committing more of those if he's able to remain in power." Further, "This thing could've been over a long time ago if we had acted decisively with the use of American air power." Mel Martinez on illegal alien Jose Antonio Vargas: "It's a difficult problem, and what we need to do is find a way in which Jose can continue to contribute to this country."

Things began an hour behind schedule, Zuckerberg showed up late to the Q&A (CNBC's explanation: He was in the bathroom), the presentation featured a video that many potential investors had previously viewed online, and the audience was only given enough time to ask eight questions, reports the Washington Post. (Reuters reports it was actually just five.) One of them was about Facebook's purchase of Instagram, which Zuckerberg defended and said he would do again, noting that Instagram's user data passed a "tipping point" that signaled it would grow much larger. One other detail of note: Security was apparently pretty extreme. Would-be investors had to show several forms of ID and be cross-checked against a list of attendees.

It was also to have been the final one of his campaign but his staff announced he would return to Ohio and Pennsylvania for events after voting today in Massachusetts.

RIM's problem is that the BlackBerry is too good at its job—its proprietary encryption is beyond the cryptopgraphic abilities of many governments. This gives concern both to open governments nervous that terrorists could use the devices to communicate securely and those with less noble reasons for eavesdropping on their citizens.

After Southern Californians saw a bright white streak and blooming cloud light up the night sky Friday, hundreds called 911, scared, reports ABC News. The culprit was much more benign: SpaceX, though Elon Musk's tweet of video of the cause, a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, Calif., was cheekily labeled, "Nuclear alien UFO from North Korea." Hours later, he tweeted, "If you liked tonight’s launch, you will really like Falcon Heavy next month: 3 rocket cores & 3X thrust. 2 cores return to base doing synchronized aerobatics. 3rd lands on droneship." The AP reports the rocket was carrying the latest batch of satellites—10 of them—for Iridium Communications. It's part of a contract that will see SpaceX update the Iridium system via 75 new satellites by mid-2018. This same Falcon 9 rocket carried some into orbit in June, though it launched from a platform in the Pacific.

Former University of Colorado student Austin James Wilkerson, 22, was spared a sentence in state prison Wednesday after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting an intoxicated female student after a St. Patrick's Day party in 2014, the Guardian reports. Instead, Wilkerson—who told the freshman student's friends that he was going to look after her—will be on probation for 20 years to life and will serve two years in the county jail under a work-release program that will allow him to leave jail for school or work every day. Prosecutors—who said Wilkerson "raped a helpless young woman after duping the people around her into believing he was going to care for her"—wanted prison, but the judge used his discretion to give him a sentence lighter than the four to 12 years in state prison the charge usually carries, the Daily Camera reports. His victim told the court that she still suffers from nightmares and panic attacks. "Worst of all is the victim blaming," she said. "'If I hadn't been drunk, this wouldn't have happened. If I hadn't gotten separated, this wouldn't have happened.' Yet it was excusable for him to rape me because he was drunk?" She implored the the judge to "have as much mercy for the rapist as he did for me that night." (Read the statement by the victim in the Brock Turner case here.)

The Australian soldier was shot in the face with lead bullets during the Battle of Passchendaele in France, blinding the 27-year-old and destroying parts of his jaw and sinuses. Philadelphia ophthalmologist WT Shoemaker tended to the soldier, who bled to death five days after sustaining the injuries after he tore out the bandages that were packed into his cheek. His body was interred in a military cemetery in Le Tréport, France; his skull wasn't, until now. The Guardian reports the skull had for nearly a century been in the possession of the Mutter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, which says the British government donated it two years after Hurdis' death "for study by military doctors conducting reconstructive surgery on soldiers." While Australia acknowledged the museum obtained the skull in a manner "entirely consistent with the applicable laws and protocols," it requested that it be repatriated, and the museum announced Tuesday it will oblige. Philly.com reports US and British armies have permitted skulls of dead soldiers to be used for medical education so long as the soldier wasn't identified. But once the Guardian in late September raised the question of the soldier's identity, a British military forum used details regarding the location, timing, and position of the soldier's wounds to conclude the skull likely belonged to Hurdis. The AP reports the museum was founded in 1863 and displays such oddities as the body of a woman "who essentially turned to soap" and a tumor removed from President Grover Cleveland. (The remains of 23 WWI soldiers may be slumbering here.)

Because her employer had booked the room, she filed for benefits and set off the legal fight. Though a federal court ruled in her favor, Australia's High Court decreed today that the woman is out of luck, reports the Australian. “The relevant question is: Did the employer induce or encourage the employee to engage in that activity?" said the court decision. “The majority held that the answer to that question was 'no.'"

The Hill reports fans of the president elect are ordering drinks at Starbucks and giving their names as "Trump" so baristas have to write "Trump" on their cups and yell it out. The movement took off Friday, with more than 27,000 tweets featuring the hashtag #TrumpCup, CNN reports. "Haven't been to @Starbucks in eons, but I have an urge to get a #TrumpCup," one man tweets. Starbucks addressed the protest in a statement: "Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition." The flames of #TrumpCup were fanned this week when a customer at a Florida Starbucks claimed his drink was taking too long due to "anti-white discrimination." Trump supporters are also cranky about Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz endorsing Hillary Clinton, as well as Starbucks' use of a "holiday" cup instead of a "Christmas" cup. But some people are questioning the logic of protesting a business by buying its products—an unorthodox choice to be sure. "Wow, the irony of millions of Trump supporters going to Starbucks and buying coffee to punish Starbucks. Unbelievable," one Twitter user writes.

Benjamin Morrow, 28, died on March 5 when an explosion tore apart his Beaver Dam home and left his body under the fallen ceiling. An investigator says Morrow's apartment was a "homemade explosives factory" containing explosive materials including a gallon of acetone, a substance used by ISIS in attacks in Manchester, England, and Paris, France, in so-called "Mother of Satan" bombs. "White supremacist material" was also found in Morrow's bedroom, per an unsealed search warrant. But local police don't think that makes Morrow a white supremacist. "I want to make very clear just because Mr. Morrow was in the possession of this material, does not categorize in any particular light," a police lieutenant tells CBS 58. "He could have been an individual that was doing research." Morrow had also stocked up two handguns, three long guns, a ballistic helmet and vest, and 2,000 rounds of ammunition, per the Fond du Lac Reporter. After bomb experts set off explosives in the apartment and then survived an unplanned blast, they opted to retrieve valuables from Morrow's neighbors and burn down the entire apartment building, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Morrow had worked as a scientist in drug development and studied chemistry at Pensacola Christian College in Florida. (His story comes just after the suspected Austin serial bomber blew himself up.)

The two leaders butted heads over the conflict in Syria, the Washington Post reports. "Our opinions do not coincide," said Putin. "But all of us have the intention to stop the violence in Syria." Obama echoed that, saying "we do have differing perspectives on the problem." While the US has agreed to supply rebel forces with weapons, Russia remains Assad's main weapons supplier; the White House also announced today that it will send another $300 million in aid for Syrian refugees, reports the BBC. The AP notes that Syria will continue to be the hot topic among G8 leaders at a working dinner tonight; Obama is expected to push Britain and France to join the US in arming the rebels. But the real standoff between Obama and Putin happened outside of a meeting room, reports the Sun. According to a source: "Both wanted the gym and Obama’s people requested it first. It could have sparked a bitter battle and ended up a laughable sticking point at the talks—but the Russians backed down." So while Obama worked out in air-conditioned comfort, the notoriously tough Putin went swimming in a chilly nearby lake. Another quirky G8 side note: Putin and Obama are neighbors.

She also confesses she can't go out with pals anymore for sushi, because "watching my friends eat my friends ruined my appetite." But the video posted for her Happy Hippie Foundation's "Backyard Sessions" isn't without theatrics: she's tickling the keyboards dressed as a unicorn, with a sympathetic-looking stuffed unicorn forlornly watching her performance from a nearby stool. As Bobby Finger writes for Jezebel, "you can easily expect one or two neurons to transmit some kind of low-level 'awww' message" during the song's "earnest" play. Miley's emotional nosedive reaches a head at around 2:55; the video is here. (Miley had a tough time last year dealing with the death of her dog Floyd.)

Police say they caught Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez at a hotel in the southwestern part of the state after an intense manhunt. His distinctive tattoos, including a prominent one of "Israel" on his neck, didn't help his anonymity. Shots were reported near the White House on Friday, and agents found two bullets yesterday—one stopped by reinforced glass in a window and the other somewhere else on the grounds. Authorities on Friday found an abandoned car with a semiautomatic inside and traced it to Ortega. He reportedly has a history of petty crimes and unstable behavior, reports the New York Times. He had been stopped earlier on Friday by Arlington police after a citizen said he had been suspiciously "circling the area." His family in Idaho reported him missing in late October.

Police in Palm Beach Gardens say footage captured by a security camera reveals the tennis star's Toyota SUV stops at a light at 1pm on June 9, and then proceeds on green before colliding with another car. Passenger Jerome Barson, 78, died June 22 from his injuries, and his wife, Linda, who was driving, suffered multiple injuries. The family sued Williams for negligence for causing the accident. Police initially faulted Williams, but changed that version in a statement on Friday, saying no blame had yet been determined, per the AP. The video shows that William has to stop in the intersection when a dark sedan makes a left turn in front of her. Williams then continues north just as Linda Barson's light turned green. Barson's Hyundai sedan proceeds westbound and hits Williams' passenger side. Williams, 37, was not injured. Police say Williams continued through the intersection "in accordance" with the law. But the Barsons' lawyer says in a statement the video shows Williams was in the intersection on a red light. "The witnesses clearly confirm the Barsons had a green light and lawfully entered the intersection." Williams' lawyer disputed that, saying she "had the right to proceed through the intersection and other vehicles including those with a red light changing to green, were obligated to yield the right-of-way." Williams, who is playing at Wimbledon, beat Japan's Naomi Osaka on Friday to advance to the fourth round.

Rescue crews arrived at the scene in Palos Verdes Estates, located just south of Los Angeles, around 2am today. Waves smashed into the car as the rescuers (area police, firefighters, and lifeguards) attempted to reach it, apparently aided by a small light, possibly from a cellphone, that the driver was able to shine; it took them 90 minutes to get to him, reports KTLA. The then-unconscious male was removed from the car and airlifted to a medical center, where he is in what the Los Angeles Times reports is "extremely critical condition." Police are investigating whether it was a suicide attempt, with a fire captain telling NBC LA that the man said "he did this on purpose."

The biggest: FBI Chief James Comey told Congress that he sees no evidence to support Trump's claims that President Obama wiretapped him. Plus, Comey confirmed that the FBI is investigating possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign during the election. Also making news: Low numbers: The daily tracking poll at Gallup has Trump's job-approval rating at 37%, his lowest mark so far, and his disapproval rating rose to 58%. It's being chalked up to controversy over his wiretapping comments and opposition to the GOP health care plan, reports CNN. Net worth: Forbes says Trump's net worth has fallen $200 million since he took office to $3.5 billion. That drops him 220 spots to 544 in its ranking of the world's richest people. Trump's decline, however, isn't about politics but about the New York real estate market. Stephen Hawking: The famed physicist said in an interview that he's not sure he'd be welcome in America under Trump because of his opposing views on the environment. See story. Billboard: An anti-Trump billboard in Phoenix is making headlines thanks in part to its dollar-shaped swastikas, per Fox News. Loyalty: The Washington Post has an unflattering front-page story about the White House that says it has installed senior aides in Cabinet departments whose main job is to monitor the loyalty of Trump's secretaries. ProPublica also reported elements of the story here. Presidents Obama, George W. Bush, and Clinton did not use such a system. Happier news: Not all the news was negative, however. The president is going to be a grandfather again—son Eric and his wife, Lara, are expecting their first child. Trump already is a grandfather of eight, per US Weekly.

After a petition to remove Renoir's work "from our national museums" on the White House's website in April failed to gain more than 15 votes and was thus archived for lack of support, Geller's anti-Renoir Instagram account now has more than 4,000 followers and his eight-or-so-person protest outside Boston's Museum of Fine Arts on Monday is getting some publicity—much to the dismay of one Genevieve Renoir, who says she is the painter’s great-great-granddaughter, reports the Guardian. She even took to Instagram to contest Geller's assertion that Renoir sucks at painting, saying with a smattering of emojis that the free market has spoken. On its face, the movement is about aesthetics. One sign at the protest claiming "aesthetic terrorism" said as much. "If you took his word for it, trees would be a collection of disgusting, green squiggly lines and eyeballs would be jet black as if they were colored by sharpies," Geller tells NPR in its three-question interview. "In real life trees are beautiful; Renoir just sucks at painting." But WBUR reports that the self-described political organizer is doing this as more of a hobby to "blow off steam" and that he means it as a joke, albeit "a pointed one." In using phrases such as "God hates Renoir," "empty calories, and "infantile green scribbles that look like crayon," Geller is also posing provocative questions about who sets a museum's standards for what is displayed and what the public should find beautiful or compelling.

That's how Zeke Smith sums up his adventure on Survivor: Game Changers, which turned out to be a bit more eventful than Smith's first appearance on the reality show last season. As Wednesday's episode revealed, fellow contestant Jeff Varner accused Smith of "a deception" before outing Smith as transgender, per the AP—a move that has drawn condemnation from an LGBT rights group, host Jeff Probst, and the public at large, per People. Though Varner apologized before he was voted off the show, Smith says he's struggled with forgiving him in the eight months since filming wrapped, in a piece for the Hollywood Reporter. "In calling me deceptive, Varner invoked one of the most odious stereotypes of transgender people," Smith writes. Varner, who is gay, implied "that I'm not really a man and that simply living as my authentic self is a nefarious trick." GLAAD has criticized Varner's move, while Probst tells Entertainment Weekly that the reaction of his teammates, who swiftly defended Smith, "mirrors what the vast majority of society will feel. You just don’t do that to someone." After Wednesday's episode aired, Varner offered his "deepest, most heartfelt apologies" in a statement on Twitter, per CNN. "I recklessly revealed something I mistakenly believed everyone already knew. I was wrong and make no excuses for it," he said.

A new study suggests that the shape of their eggs played a role, reports the BBC. Scientists aren't sure exactly what that role was, but they do know that eggs of survivor birds were shaped differently than eggs of dinosaurs and birds that got wiped out. Among other things, the non-survivor eggs were more elongated and "significantly more symmetrical," says the news service. The difference in shape suggests that the birds themselves differed in physiology, reports phys.org, presumably in ways that gave them an advantage when the mass extinction took place 65 million years ago. One theory is that the differences in shape may have something to do with crucial differences in hatching and nesting behavior. "I suspect modern birds survived the major extinction event because they used contact incubation that's prevalent now," says one researcher from the UK's University of Lincoln. "They built nests and sat on their eggs whereas most of the birds prior to that were burying the eggs like their theropod ancestors, potentially making them more vulnerable."

If you're thinking, "the horror!" then you'll be glad to hear that management for the Japanese rail company has formally apologized for the train's 20-seconds-early departure. "The crew did not sufficiently check the departure time and performed the departure operation," it said in an official statement and "sincere" apology that led to bemusement on the internet. "I once had an Israeli bus driver laugh at me after he closed the door on my hips and drove off with my legs hanging out of the bus. I am so envious of Japan right now," one person tweeted. The BBC reports that it's "rare" for trains in Japan to be off-schedule, and another tweet highlights that fact, noting, "Have been on a train in Japan where I heard an apology for the train running one minute late." The statement notes that there were no official customer complaints lodged about the early departure from a station just north of Tokyo, but apologizes if any customers missed the train by 20 seconds and were forced to wait for the next one—four minutes later, reports Bloomberg. Yahoo News UK notes that Japan's trains are "among the most reliable in the world," offering a mournful comparison to Britain, where "commuters are only too acquainted with the daily frustration of late trains on the way to work." And the New York Daily News notes things aren't much better in that newspaper's fair city, where subway delays collectively add up to 34,900 hours on the average weekday.

With every budget, lawmakers are slashing into discretionary spending, but with Social Security and various health entitlement costs rising, government spending is growing anyway. The result: "Governmental competence is being systematically degraded. … We are spending more and getting less." By 2024, current projections show that all spending on non-entitlements will be just 7.4% of GDP—the lowest share since 1940. Cuts are hitting everything from the military (sort of) to medical research to the federal courts. Yet political debates never focus on this dynamic, in part because polls show the public isn't concerned. "Both liberals and conservatives are complicit in this charade," but ironically it's liberals who most refuse to discuss entitlements. Hence another paradox: "The pro-government party in rhetoric has become an anti-government party in practice." Click for Samuelson's full column.

On Wednesday, a University of Pennsylvania professor spotted an SUV near the Philadelphia Convention Center, souped up with two high-tech license-plate readers and a placard linking it to the Pennsylvania State Police—but with a Google Maps decal smacked onto its window, PhillyVoice.com reports. "WTF?" Matt Blaze tweeted with a picture of the strangely camouflaged vehicle, which the Philadelphia Police Department did confirm Thursday was part of its fleet. "However, the placing of any particular decal on the vehicle was not approved through any chain of command," a department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Motherboard. The rep adds the decals were ordered to be taken down ASAP and that an investigation was launched. What some are saying is worrisome is the fact that these Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs)—which law enforcement can use for everything from tracking down stolen cars to following up on AMBER Alerts—are able to take in thousands of plate images per minute, basically enabling law enforcement to spy on drivers without warrants. "It's certainly concerning if the city of Philadelphia is running mass surveillance and going out of its way to mislead people," Dave Maass, a researcher with the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, tells Motherboard. Gizmodo marvels at the apparently backfired scheme to cover up the SUV's real mission, noting that the Google Maps sticker "simply looked too handmade." Meanwhile, a Google rep tells Motherboard it is also looking into the matter. "If I were Google, I would be seriously rankled over the use of their logo to hide surveillance," Maass says.

During a Sunday interview on Face the Nation, he reminds Americans they "got what they voted for," noting that Trump's White House is not much different from his unconventional presidential campaign—even if the drama coming out of it is "different from anything we've ever confronted," reports CBS News. "I don't understand why people are that shocked," he said. The Florida senator, who battled Donald Trump for the GOP nomination, did express that the administration would "benefit from some systems in place that perhaps avoid some of the unnecessary friction points that come up on a daily basis." Politico see echoes of Mitch McConnell's Tuesday comment: "We could do with a little less drama from the White House." John Dickerson kicked off the interview by immediately asking about former FBI director James Comey. Rubio's take: "Well, obviously, look, these media reports that are out there raise questions and deserve answers. What did the president say? Did in fact you keep memos? What do those memos say? And why did you write them? And what was your feeling? And the American public deserves to know the answers to that. I think that's fair to the president.

Pyongyang has taken its complaint about The Interview all the way to the United Nations, reports Reuters. In the movie, Rogen and Franco play a TV producer and host who land an interview with Kim Jong Un and get hired by the CIA to kill him.

(The North used similar language in an earlier diatribe.)

Novichok—meaning "newcomer" in Russian—is a class of chemical agents developed in the Soviet Union in the 1970s and '80s "specifically to get around treaties banning chemical weapons," reports NBC News. Only revealed to the wider world by a former Russian scientist in 1991, the agents aren't fully understood, but they're believed to be among the most deadly in existence, per CNN. Though there are "no known previous uses," per Reuters, one specific agent, A-230, is described as five to eight times as toxic as VX, a weapon of mass destruction used in the February 2017 assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. In powder and liquid form, Novichok agents produce effects—respiratory failure and death by asphyxiation at worst—as little as 30 seconds after inhalation or absorption through the skin, reports the BBC. They're also believed to cause more permanent injury and be more resistant to antidotes than other nerve agents. In addition, the agents are easier to handle and harder to detect, as most involve two not-as-toxic components that only become deadly when mixed. This makeup apparently allowed the Soviet Union to develop such agents even after committing to chemical arms control, experts say. May says it's "highly likely" Russia is responsible for the March 4 attack on 66-year-old Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter, who remain in critical condition. But Russia is denying involvement and refusing to explain the use of Novichok until samples of the agent are provided, the AP reports.

Last week, sources told the AP that the FAA advisory committee had voted to approve the use of smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and other gadgets for takeoff and landing. But a senior Amazon executive on the advisory panel now tells the Wall Street Journal that the new recommendations go even further, clearing the way for "gate to gate use" of devices, regardless of the apps they're running or the wireless transmission mode they're in. Paul Misener, Amazon's VP of global public policy, also says the panel recommended a simple system for airlines to prove that devices and WiFi won't interfere with their planes—one that looks at past tests instead of requiring a host of new ones. If the recommendations are approved, fliers would still have to use on-board WiFi to access the Internet—not due to safety concerns, but because the FCC bans airborne cell service. About 60% of commercial passenger planes are set up for WiFi, though the largest US inflight Internet provider says its service doesn't really work below 10,000 feet—so even though you may soon be allowed to read your Kindle during takeoff, you may not be able to download e-books at the time.

While the party has long celebrated Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson at such dinners, the pair's own slave-owning history is finally taking a toll. Jackson's role in driving Native Americans out of the southeastern US—the "Trail of Tears"—also is a factor. Democrats in Georgia, Connecticut, Missouri, Maine, New Hampshire, and other states have scrapped their Jefferson-Jackson affairs or are considering doing so. In Iowa, a Democratic leader said it's all about making sure the party lives up to the values of "inclusiveness, diversity, and equality." The New York Times also has taken notice: Controversy over the Confederate flag may be generating bigger headlines, its story observes, but the efforts by Democrats "to remove Jefferson and Jackson from their official identity underscore one of the most consequential trends of American politics: Democrats’ shift from a union-powered party organized primarily around economic solidarity to one shaped by racial and sexual identity."

Smith in the Washington Post. Dinesh D’Souza recently argued that “the president inherited political radicalism from his father.” But Obama Sr.—whom Smith knew personally—“was, in fact, an urbane, Western-oriented intellectual” of an only “modestly leftist bent.” Meanwhile, it is clear that D’Souza has misread President Obama’s autobiography, Dreams from My Father. The younger man was inspired by Obama Sr. “as a man of reason, a defender of modernity against tribalism and corruption,” Smith notes. “Conservatives have many reasons to oppose and criticize the president, but caricatures such as D'Souza's contribute nothing to the political dialogue.”

Thompson, who has been with the world's biggest restaurant chain for almost 25 years and took charge in 2012, is leaving after a major sales slump and a 15% drop in annual profits, reports Forbes. Thompson, who joined McDonald's as an electrical engineer and says he eats there every day, will be replaced by chief brand officer Steve Easterbrook, a former accountant who will be the chain's first British CEO, reports the Financial Times. McDonald's shares have fallen around 6% over the last year but they jumped 3% after news of Thompson's departure, reports the Guardian.

Relying on satellite communications and an unanswered ground-to-air phone call placed 17 minutes after the last recorded radar data, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau arrived at the following scenario: The Boeing 777 ran out of fuel after leaving its flight course, the right engine quit before the left, and the plane spiraled into the Indian Ocean west of Australia, USA Today reports. "This scenario resulted in the aircraft entering a descending spiraling low bank angle left turn and the aircraft entering the water in a relatively short distance after the last engine flameout," the report states. Flight 370's final resting place based on that scenario may not be too far from where investigators are searching for the plane, which vanished March 8. Per the report, it "may be located within relatively close proximity" to the current search area in the "7th arc." NBC News notes the report's assertion that "the next, underwater phase of the search should be prioritized further south within the wide search area." The report states that "ongoing refinement may result in changes to search asset deployment," though it isn't clear if any changes will be made based on the report's findings.

Time for jail: It's one thing if Sheen wants to quietly destroy his own life, writes psychiatrist Dale Archer at Fox News. But Sheen's repeated violent outbursts makes this different. "Sending him to another rehab facility with no jail time and no consequences for his actions" won't cut it. "This guy may really hurt someone, even kill someone in an intoxicated state if this is not addressed." Money machine: Don't hold your breath waiting for CBS and Warner Brothers to disavow him, writes Lacey Rose at Forbes. He's too profitable. The only thing that matters to them is that Two and a Half Men is the most popular comedy in prime time. Until its ratings tank or he goes to jail for a while, "I don’t imagine you’ll be hearing much from those TV bosses of his." Hopeless? Sheen's behavior is familiar to anyone who's dealt with an addicted loved one, and his continued TV presence is "ridiculous at this point," writes Mary Elizabeth Williams at Salon. He can't seem to kick his problem, so why do we keep giving him chances? "Because even in the face of a seemingly fatal diagnosis, it's human nature to hope."

Cain thinks he knows: one of his former political advisers who now works for Rick Perry. Cain tells Forbes that he briefed Curt Anderson about the allegations in 2003 when Cain was in the midst of an unsuccessful run for Senate. Anderson denied it: “I never heard about this story until I read about it in Politico," he said. "I have nothing but good things to say about Herman Cain." A spokesman for the Perry camp also denied the charge and instead suggested that it might be the work of, you guessed it, Mitt Romney, notes the Hill. “By the way, there are real ties between Romney campaign backers and Mr. Cain and the National Restaurant Association,” said Ray Sullivan. (The Romney camp has previously denied planting the story.) In his Forbes interview, Cain said he told Anderson about the "baseless" charges in case his political foes raised it. "I told my wife about this in 1999 and I’ve got nothing to hide,” he added. Click to read about a third woman who has complained about Cain's behavior in the 1990s.

That's what he told them, after all, and it explained why the World War II veteran would set off airport scanners and ask his grandkids to sit on "the other" knee. But when he died at age 94 and was cremated, officials at the crematorium handed his family the remains—mixed with the 6 ounces of shrapnel he was carrying around in his leg, the Telegraph reports. "It’s amazing because he never used to complain about the pain," his daughter tells the Daily Mail. Brown was serving in France in June 1944 when a booby-trap device fired red-hot metal into his leg; he opted to avoid the butchery of war surgery and leave the shrapnel in there. In later life, though, he still took daily walks and was "an active man," says one of his grandchildren. Click for the Mail's full article and its comments, some of which question whether the metal really came from his cremated coffin.

"I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents," Trump tweeted Friday morning. "I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!" The tweet follows an interview with Fox News in which Trump made a similar point, reports CNN. "Why didn't somebody call the FBI 36 years ago?" Trump asked in the Fox interview. "I mean you could also say when did this all happen, what's going on? To take a man like this and besmirch—now with that being said, let her have her say and let's see how it all works out." In another tweet Friday, Trump described Kavanaugh as a "fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don’t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay." As things stand now, Kavanaugh is expected to testify Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Ford is negotiating to appear later in the week, perhaps Thursday. (Did Kavanaugh favor "a look" for his clerks?)

Police say 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen was part of a group of teens who were walking back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society mosque in Sterling around 3:30am after eating at an IHOP when they were confronted by a motorist, the Washington Post reports. BuzzFeed reports that mosque officials say the man swung a baseball bat at the girls. After running back to the mosque to seek help, the group discovered Nabra was missing, police say. A body believed to be hers was found in a pond a few miles away around 12 hours later. Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, was arrested and charged with murder after police saw him "driving suspiciously" in the area, according to a Fairfax Police press release. Nabra and the other girls, who went out to eat during a break in Ramadan prayers, had been in Muslim dress, though police say they aren't sure if the attack was motivated by bias or a dispute. The mosque "has always welcomed me and so many in northern Virginia like family," Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said Sunday night, condemning the "unspeakable attack." "Words fail at a time like this, so we'll all have to do the best we can to surround them with the love and support they've always shown each of us," he said, per NBC4.

Based on additional leads, detectives returned Friday to an area near Lake Cachuma in Santa Barbara County and found the remains of Aramazd Andressian Jr., per the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The body was flown to the Los Angeles County coroner's office Saturday, reports the AP. It will be examined to confirm the boy's identity and cause of death, coroner's Assistant Chief Ed Winter said. Dental records and X-rays may be used because "the child was up there for the past" two months. KABC-TV contacted the boy's mother, and reports that she responded "with three broken heart emojis." The boy was found the same day his father, Aramazd Andressian Sr., 35, was returned to Southern California from Las Vegas, where he was arrested last week. He has adamantly denied harming the boy. Investigators have been searching for the boy since his father was found passed out in a large park in South Pasadena on April 22. Andressian had taken prescription pills and was found in a car doused in gasoline in an apparent suicide attempt. Andressian told authorities that he drove that day about 145 miles to Lake Cachuma. Authorities had twice searched the lake unsuccessfully, using dogs and a dive team. Although initially arrested, Andressian was released but later charged with murder. Prosecutors contend that Andressian killed the boy to get back at his estranged wife. Andressian had shaved his beard, lightened his hair and had been socializing while living out of a Las Vegas hotel for 47 days—conduct characterized as inconsistent with that of a grieving parent, sheriff's officials said.

The former fugitive mouthed "hello" and nodded. The reunion of sorts has led to a spate of stories along the tale-of-two-brothers vein, exploring how the Boston natives rose to power in their chosen fields. See the Boston Globe and AP. “You’ve got to understand something," said one of William's friends. “We’re South Boston people, and when you grow up in Southie, the cardinal virtue is loyalty. ... And you think he wouldn’t be there today?" William eventually became president of the University of Massachusetts but resigned in 2003 amid pressure from Gov. Mitt Romney and others over what the Globe describes as his "cavalier" attitude toward his brother. "It’s my hope that I’m never helpful to anyone against him," he once told a grand jury. "I don’t feel an obligation to help everyone to catch him."

In a Twitter post Sunday night, the former Fox News host wrote that she was "surprised and saddened beyond words" by Mund's letter on Friday complaining of how she has been treated during her nearly one-year reign as Miss America. In her letter, Mund wrote that she has been bullied, manipulated, and silenced by the pageant's current top leadership, headed by Carlson and CEO Regina Hopper. Both have denied bullying Mund and say they support her; Carlson says she has reached out to Mund, but that Mund only wants to communicate with her via email. "Actions have consequences," Carlson wrote, addressing herself directly to Mund. "Friday, as an organization, we learned that $75,000 in scholarships which would have been the first scholarship increase in years is no longer on the table as a direct result of the explosive allegations in your letter." Carlson continued, "The impact won't stop there. We are already seeing a negative ripple effect across the entire organization, and I am so concerned that it will dilute the experience for the next woman selected to wear the crown." Carlson didn't specify how the scholarship money was lost, reports the AP: by sponsors backing out, donors canceling promises to contribute, or some other cause.

(The money wouldn't come from US taxpayers, but the State Department shed little light on the companies or kinds of investments involved.) Speaking at a World Economic Forum conference yesterday, the secretary of state said the investment could boost the Palestinian GDP by 50% in just three years and cut unemployment from 21% to around 8%, the Washington Post reports. "Now, is this fantasy? I don't think so, because there are already great examples of investment and entrepreneurship that are working in the West Bank," Kerry told the audience, which included Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, CNN reports. Kerry said the plan—which will be dependent on progress in peace talks—will focus on boosting the West Bank's tourism and agriculture sectors.

The legislation, which handily passed on Saturday, eliminates a loophole in which domestic abusers were only required to surrender their handguns after a conviction, notes WKBW. "New York is once again leading the way to prevent gun violence, and with this common sense reform, break the inextricable link between gun violence and domestic violence," Cuomo said. "Half of the women who are murdered in this country are murdered by an intimate partner," he said, citing a CDC study.

The erstwhile child star is launching a subscription lifestyle site promising a behind-the-scenes look at her "exclusive world," according to the Hollywood Reporter. Lohan announced the move on Instagram, promising she "will be posting a lot" to her Preemium site. The site itself promises subscribers will learn all of Lohan's "secrets and breaking news before anyone else," including access to "personal diaries, video updates, exclusive personal photos, fashion and beauty tutorials, shopping guides, behind the scenes content, my favorite products and much more." Per THR, the Preemium site so far includes nine posts, mostly selfies or pictures of Lohan and one 30-second iPhone video of her posing for photos. The first post also includes some inside information from Lohan: "I am in a period of renewal and that's why I deleted all my posts from Instagram. Now you can follow me here on Preemium." THR calls the whole thing "a bit sad," while LAist notes that the site's name is "presumably meant to conjure an air of exclusivity, but ... instead makes us picture the nervous setting of a NICU." Preemium, a new site, so far only offers the Lohan subscription but is promising to add four more stars fans can follow soon.

Intense lobbying already is underway, with one of the most contentious issues the idea of a "border adjustment tax," or BAT. Here's where things stand: The border tax would effectively levy a tax on products coming into the US and give tax breaks to companies sending products abroad. Proponents say it would protect US jobs, while opponents say it would raise prices of everyday goods for many Americans. See a primer at CNN. As you might expect, companies such as Boeing, Merck, and Dow Chemical that export many of their products are big fans of the BAT, while heavy importers such as retailers Walmart and Target oppose it because they say it would drive up their prices, reports the Atlantic. A huge ad war is unfolding. The National Retail Federation, for example, is running ads against the BAT, like this parody of an infomercial. Paul Ryan and House Republican leaders are pushing for the BAT, but their Senate counterparts generally oppose it, reports the the Washington Post. Conservative Tom Cotton, for instance, called it "a theory wrapped in a speculation inside a guess," in this op-ed at USA Today. In a possible hint of compromise, the Post notes that Treasury chief Steven Mnuchin has suggested that some products or industries could be exempt, without offering details. President Trump himself sounded skeptical of the tax initially but might be warming up. "Anytime I hear border adjustment, I don’t love it," he told the Wall Street Journal in January. In February, however, he told Reuters that it "could lead to a lot more jobs," and on Sunday, Reince Priebus said Trump thought a border tax could even "the playing field between our country" and others, per Fox News. The success of the BAT hinges on the economic premise that it would strengthen the US dollar, though there's a fair amount of skepticism about that, notes Business Insider. A more in-depth analysis, which takes note of "significant confusion and uncertainty" about how exchange rates might respond, is at Real Clear Economics. The European Union might sue if a border tax goes into effect, reports dw.com. Canada isn't a fan, either, notes Fortune. More broadly, the GOP's failure to repeal ObamaCare complicates tax reform, because Republicans were relying on savings from the ACA's elimination as part of their calculations. The New York Times delves into the thorny legislative consequences, which mean that Republicans might have to work more closely with Democrats.

The Fox host, who previously defended Moore after the candidate was accused of sexual misconduct, issued an ultimatum Tuesday night, telling Moore he has 24 hours to explain "inconsistencies" in his story, the Washington Post reports. "You must remove any doubt," said Hannity, who was facing an advertiser boycott. "If he can't do this, then Judge Moore needs to get out of this race." AL.com reports that the Republican National Committee has also withdrawn its support of Moore, though the Alabama Republican Party has yet to issue a statement on the candidate. President Trump is expected to comment on Moore now that he is back in the US, and he faces what Politico describes as a "wrenching call," with congressional leaders urging him to help push Moore out of the race and conservative Moore loyalists strongly opposed to any such move. In an op-ed, the Wall Street Journal argues that Moore's "credibility has fallen below the level of survivability" and if he refuses to drop out, the Republican Party will be better off if Democrat Doug Jones wins. Moore, whose latest accuser says he sexually assaulted her when she was 16, spoke at a Baptist revival in an Alabama church Tuesday night but said little about the allegations, the AP reports. "I want to talk about where this country's going and if we don't get back to God, we're not going anywhere," he said.

"We cannot beat Ebola without more funding," he said during a visit yesterday to the National Institutes of Health, the New York Times reports. "It's a good Christmas present to the American people and to the world," he added, as per the AP. And while the New York Times reports that monitoring has ended for those exposed to the NYC doctor who had Ebola, and the Boston Globe notes that Massachusetts General Hospital says everything there is under control with a patient suspected of having the virus, the international response to the crisis overseas is still taking heat. A Doctors Without Borders report issued yesterday notes that global help has been "patchy and slow"; although progress has been made in building Ebola management centers in West Africa, staffing is often subpar. "People are still dying horrible deaths in an outbreak that has already killed thousands," the president of Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. "We can't let our guard down and allow this to become a 'double failure': a response that is slow to begin with, and then is ill-adapted in the end." While some may balk at the high price tag, Obama stressed that it's a "smart investment" to make, notes Reuters, and that if we don't contain the virus at its origins, the US could remain vulnerable, the Times adds.

Police tell the Journal-Constitution they were called to a hotel around 3:30am today about "someone shooting at a bus that Lil Wayne was on," and they found two buses shot multiple times; sources tell TMZ the shooting happened within minutes of the rapper's entourage pulling away from the club. No one was injured. Drivers said the buses were shot on a highway by two white vehicles, "possibly a Corvette-style vehicle and an SUV," police say, but so far there are no known suspects.

Lee Jeong Hwa, who got out in 2010 from her home in Kilju County, tells NBC News that residents started talking of a "ghost disease" after people started perishing, and they're tying it all back to the regime's nuke tests. "We thought we were dying because we were poor and we ate badly," she says. "Now we know it was the radiation." A World Health Organization fact sheet explains the havoc, based on exposure levels, that radiation can wreak on the body, causing such maladies as burns, hair loss, and skin conditions, with cancer also a possibility years after exposure. A Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety rep tells NBC it's "assumed" that locals are being heavily exposed to radiation—but tests on Lee, one of 30 defectors being examined, have turned up no evidence of radiation contamination, and a Seoul National University professor says that even though he believes there's likely merit to the defectors' claims, scientists have a "total lack of data" to back them up. Another expert adds that "sniff" sensors in the region haven't picked up signs of radioactive matter after past tests—and some residents' tales of sickened flora and fauna go back decades, long before North Korea started testing nukes in 2006. Meanwhile, Gizmodo points out a Chinese nuclear expert told the Telegraph earlier this year a radiation leak at the test site is "inevitable," even if it hasn't yet happened, and that groundwater contamination may be the biggest concern.

The fuss started when a Russian official, in rebutting claims of those lousy hotel rooms, accused foreigners of sabotage with this quote to the Wall Street Journal: "We have surveillance video from the hotels that shows people turn on the shower, direct the nozzle at the wall, and then leave the room for the whole day." That set off a furious Internet reaction, most of it along the lines of the Huffington Post's "He's Watching You Shower!" headline, accompanied by a photo of Vladimir Putin. Amid the outcry, a spokesman for the original Russian official walked back the statement. "No such thing was ever said," he asserted, suggesting that it was either a mistranslation or a joke, reports AP. He insisted that no guests' hotel room have surveillance cameras. Of course, NBC reporter Richard Engel said this week that his equipment got hacked as soon as he arrived in Russia, notes HuffPo. “The State Department warns that travelers should have no expectation of privacy," he said. "Even in their hotel rooms."

Jack Tytell, 40, known as the "Jewish Terrorist" in the Israeli press, shot to death a taxi driver and later a shepherd at point-blank range after moving to Israel from the US in 1997. Years later, he sent pipe bombs to a teenager and a professor at Hebrew University, and attacked a police station during a gay pride parade, reports the Jerusalem Post. Tytell claimed to be guided by angels, and his lawyers tried to get him a more lenient term with an insanity defense. The court rejected the strategy, however. Among the reasons: Tytell said he considered killing a Palestinian child but decided against it because it was "not the American way," reports the International Business Times. A judged deemed that evidence that Tytell knew right from wrong.

"We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem," said the department's Computer Readiness Team, which recommends a browser change "until an official update is available," reports USA Today, which notes that users can also avoid hackers by turning off Adobe Flash. Microsoft says that so far, it is only aware of "limited, targeted attacks" exploiting the flaw, which allows hackers to install malware on vulnerable computers, the New York Times reports. Users of newer versions of Windows can probably expect a security patch soon, but XP users may be out of luck, since Microsoft stopped supporting the operating system earlier this month. Lance Ulanoff at Mashable, however, says the flaw is so serious that it could be a mistake not to offer XP users one final patch. "Windows XP users could be so disenfranchised that they simply switch to Macs and Microsoft ends up losing far more than it can gain by finally getting everyone off Windows XP," he writes. Security firm Symantec, meanwhile, has offered XP users some protection tools on its blog.

On that day, the 20-year-old stood in front of a Clark County, Nev., judge and explained why her birth certificate should read male. And then it was so, and Maddy forever became Jake, and Jake called his dad to share the good news. Jon Ralston heard a "giddy" voice on the other end of the line, and the moment inspired Ralston—"one of the most respected political reporters in Nevada," per the Washington Post—to write a "love story," a blog post about "how my daughter became my son," he tweeted. It's been shared more than 16,000 times. The post is bookended with parallel statements, opening with the line, "When Maddy Ralston came into this world almost 21 years ago, it was love at first sight." He writes of "a stunning, blonde-blue-eyed kid" who he thought of as a tomboy through and through. "We went shopping for clothes, and she would never go into the girls’ section. Always the boys. It wasn't even a question. I didn’t really care. She was my little girl, and I adored her." He could tell that things were rough for Maddy as she was teased and bullied and called a lesbian in high school, that "something wasn't right." But "I don't think I even listened very well when Maddy told me a few years ago she was really a male inside." What he thought was a phase clearly wasn't, and Ralston has "come to not just accept it but to embrace" his child's truth—though there are moments when it's hard. And then, that touching bookend: "When I get home later this week, I will see someone officially named Jake Ralston for the first time. And one thing I know for certain: It will be love at first sight." Read his full post here.

Jose Luis Ochoa, 35, died after being stabbed in the right calf by the blade attached to one of the fighting birds, the Bakersfield Californian reports. Ochoa and others fled after an anonymous caller tipped the sheriff’s office off to the fight. Though Ochoa was later brought to a medical center, a sergeant notes that a major artery could have been severed by the cut: “People have been known to bleed out from those injuries if medical attention is not obtained immediately.” Human deaths are “pretty rare, but I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often considering the knives they put on those birds," says a Humane Society director. "It's not a surprise that somebody got killed.” He also notes cockfighting continues to be popular in California because it is a misdemeanor, as opposed to a felony in many nearby states. A report last month in London’s Daily Mail notes that a man in India was also recently killed when a fighting rooster slashed his throat. (Click for another sad cockfighting story out of California.)

By making early morning doctor's appointments and not driving their actual cars to any of them, according to People. So what type of cars did they use? The New York Daily News calls them "untraceable cars," while Radar goes with the more conventional "rental cars." "Brad did everything he could to keep things secret and protect Angie," says a family insider. "They really wanted Angie to be able to recover and rest before they shared the story." PopSugar notes that Pitt even did an interview with Esquire during this time period and didn't reveal anything, though he did call Jolie "the best person" and revealed that he has "very few friends" outside of his family. (Angie has expressed a similar sentiment before.)

The official tells the New York Times that a team of 15 Saudi agents were waiting for the Washington Post columnist when he arrived around 1:15pm on Oct. 2, expecting to receive paperwork for his planned marriage. The official said Khashoggi was beaten and tortured almost immediately after he was taken to the office of the Saudi consul general, Mohammed al-Otaibi, who's reportedly heard on an audio recording of the slaying. Khashoggi—who was also drugged, per the Wall Street Journal—was dead within minutes, but not before his fingers were cut off, the official said. More:

Scientists say that an ancient upper jawbone and associated stone tools could also mean that Homo sapiens—modern humans—arose in Africa far earlier than fossils now show. And it may cause rethinking about how we evolved and interacted with now-extinct cousin species, such as Neanderthals. "When they start moving out of Africa and what geographical route they choose to do it are the two most important questions in recent human evolution," said Tel Aviv University anthropologist Israel Hershkovitz, lead author of a study published in the journal Science. The jawbone, complete with several well-preserved teeth, was found to be somewhere between 177,000 and 194,000 years old, reports the AP. Previously, the oldest fossils of modern humans found outside of Africa were somewhere from 90,000 to 120,000 years old, also in Israel. So given the range in both those estimates, the jawbone might be about 50,000 to 100,000 years older. The jaw was found in 2002 in the collapsed Misliya cave on the western slope of Mount Carmel. Researchers spent the last decade-and-a-half looking for more remains and other fossils before publishing their study. They say the jaw belonged to a young adult of unknown gender. The Science paper suggests modern humans could have left Africa 220,000 years ago, with some of the authors saying maybe it was even earlier. That's in part because the cave also contained about 60,000 flint tools, mostly blades and sharp points, some of which are 250,000 years old, per a study co-author. The AP has much more.

"I was just wondering if you’ve seen the movie The Bodyguard, because I love that movie," Ellen asked, and a laughing Heidi said that yes, she has. Klum first confirmed rumors of the relationship in September. "I've actually watched that movie since [the relationship began]," Heidi told Ellen. "I had to!" She joked that she may even dress up as Whitney Houston's character for Halloween next year, E! reports. (Click to see why she canceled her famous Halloween party this year.)

His 22-year-old daughter appears to have posted some incendiary comments on Facebook in which she taunts "all you HK taxpayers" for funding her "beautiful shoes, dresses, and clutches!! Thank you so much!!!!" It all started when Chai Yan Leung apparently took offense to some calling her diamond necklace a dog collar, to which the London School of Economics law student replied that it was bought on "silly" taxpayer's money, reports the Times of India. She went on to add insult to injury: "Actually maybe I shouldn't say 'all you'—since most of you here are probably unemployed hence have all this time obsessed with bombarding me with messages." Business Insider points out that while Chai Yan's apparent Facebook page is now down, evidence of her high-fashion lifestyle persists online. Her Instagram account catalogs "bespoke" bags, as well as designer shoes that serve as room decor. Her Facebook account has been the scene of several other scandalous posts: In June, Chai Yan posted a photo of herself with a slashed wrist in a bathtub, asking if she'll bleed to death. Another post included the words: "I love blood," reports the South China Morning Post. (Leung, meanwhile, says he will meet with the protestors but not resign.)

Director Bill Condon says LeFou, sidekick to the film's villain and played by Josh Gad, is gay and the film will feature an "exclusively gay moment." But patrons of Henagar Drive-In Theatre won't see it. "When companies continually force their views on us, we need to take a stand," the owner of the drive-in says in a Facebook post Thursday. "If I can't sit through a movie with God or Jesus sitting by me, then we have no business showing it." The owner of the theater, which recently changed ownership, says having a gay character makes the film inappropriate for children. He says he's a Christian and the theater puts the Bible ahead of any financial considerations. That's good, because most of the responses to the post have been critical of the theater. But Henagar Drive-In Theatre isn't alone. NBC News reports a "pro-life and pro-family" group has started an online petition to boycott Beauty and the Beast (which NBC notes was already the story of "a girl who falls in love with an animal") because LeFou is gay. The petition has more than 50,000 signatures. Meanwhile, Variety's film critic says if Beauty and the Beast was attempting to portray LeFou as gay, it failed. So this may all be much ado about nothing.

Mohammed Dewji, who was seized Oct. 11 by masked gunmen while headed to the gym in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam, has been released, the BBC reports. "I have returned home safely," his company, MeTL Group, quoted the 43-year-old father of three as saying in a Friday night tweet. "I thank the authorities of Tanzania, including the Police Force for working for my safe return." CNN reports he was found early Saturday morning near a Dar es Salaam tennis court, and he appeared at a presser with police, dressed in pants and a white tee. January Makamba, the country's environment minister, says he visited Dewji at his home after his return and that Dewji seemed relatively unharmed, save for marks on his hands and legs where he'd been bound. "I have just spoken to him and his father 20 minutes ago," Makamba tweeted. "In his voice, he's the usual Mo. So he is okay." Dar es Salaam's police chief tells IOL that Dewji told police his kidnappers "treated him very well and gave him food." His office reportedly told Forbes Africa he believed his abductors were from South Africa. It's not clear how he was let go, or whether a ransom was paid, though a source said to be close to Dewji tells Forbes Africa his abductors let him go after getting spooked by all the media hype. (Dewji has promised to donate half of his fortune to charity.)

The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges Weinstein raped de la Huerta twice in New York in December 2010, taunting her with phone calls between the two assaults. New York police said a year ago that they were investigating de la Huerta's allegations. No charges have been filed in the case, but Weinstein is charged there with the rape of another woman. In a new allegation, the suit states that the following month Weinstein exposed himself to the actress in a Beverly Hills hotel when she went to confront him. She alleges Weinstein tried to get de la Huerta to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman. About a year after the incidents, de la Huerta was fired from the HBO show Boardwalk Empire, and the lawsuit states she has reason to believe Weinstein was involved. It cites a photo that appeared in the New York Times of Weinstein talking to Martin Scorsese, a director and executive producer on the show, a few weeks before her firing. Weinstein's attorney Ben Brafman in response to the suit pointed out the lack of charges in New York, and said in an emailed statement that de la Huerta's "newly minted version of events including her new California claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination." More than 75 women have accused Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, of wrongdoing. (Click for all the details on de la Huerta's allegations.)

Mr. G. didn't eat for six days and moped about in what seemed to be a depressive funk—until rescuers reunited him with Jellybean.

Macken, 88, says he has written to immigration minister Peter Dutton and offered a "body swap" with somebody in a camp in Nauru or on Indonesia's Manus Island, the Guardian reports. "I understand this is an unusual request but I offer it in complete sincerity," Macken wrote. "My reason for making this proposal is simple. I can no longer remain silent as innocent men, women, and children are being held in appalling circumstances on Manus Island and Nauru." "It is even worse that they are being held in these dangerous and inhospitable conditions in order to ensure no other asylum seekers and refugees attempt to come to Australia for protection," he wrote. "The Australian government is essentially treating refugees in these camps as human shields and this is utterly immoral." Macken wrote that he would consider it a "privilege" to live out his final years in one of the camps in return for a refugee becoming an Australian citizen. He says he isn't making the offer for publicity and will happily make the swap without it being publicly announced, the BBC reports. (Australia has been accused of covering up "routine dysfunction and cruelty" at the Nauru camp, including hundreds of incidents involving children.)

Halper is the largest single donor to the Occupy Wall Street movement, having donated $20,000 to the anti-corporate Adbusters magazine, which launched the protests. The weirdest thing about Halper is not that he’s a retired Wall Street trader who used to vice chair the New York Mercantile Exchange, or that he’s a 1-percenter. No, the weirdest thing about Halper is that in addition his Adbusters donation, he also donated the maximum allowed $2500 to the presidential campaign of corporate favorite Mitt Romney. “We can only imagine what it's like to have enough money to write several-thousand-dollar checks to causes that effectively cancel each other out,” writes Max Read on Gawker. Halper explains his giving to the New York Times as “a little ADD—like me.” He is a longtime donor to Adbusters and friend of the editor in chief, and wrote the check despite “rolling his eyes” at the idea initially, he says. He soon found himself swept up in the excitement and now makes daily visits to Zuccotti Park, which he calls “the coolest place in New York.” “If there’s pain,” he concludes, “it should be shared.”

A look at coverage of the anniversary: Bias starred at the University of Maryland, and a feature in the Baltimore Sun includes a memory of his first game as a starter. He was a nervous kid for much of it, until teammate Pete Holbert committed a foul, and Bias then took control and led the Terps to an OT win. "It was like, 'This guy is going to be really good," recalls Holbert. That prediction proved true. The Washington Post quotes Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski as saying in 2003 that only two opposing players had stood out in his long career: Bias and a guy named Michael Jordan. "He could invent ways to score, and there was nothing you could do about it," the coach said of Bias. Another person put it this way: "He was It." After his death—"the cruelest thing I've ever heard," said Celtics great Larry Bird—Bias became a pawn in the war on drugs, writes Jon Schuppe at NBC News. His OD "sparked a panic, stoked by false rumors and a high-stakes political campaign, that culminated in a law that swept thousands of low-level drug offenders—most of them young and black—into prison." The effects of that law, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, still resonate today. Bias' mother, Lonise, lost a second son to a drive-by shooting a few years later, and has since worked as a community activist helping young people, reports WTOP. A post at Deadspin sums it up this way: "His death still makes everyone crazy."

Jacqui Cheng experimented with deleting one of her photos from Flickr, Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook last year. Flickr and Twitter removed the photos within seconds—meaning that the direct link to the photo stopped working almost immediately. MySpace and Facebook, however, were slower—and now, 16 months later, the direct link to Cheng’s deleted Facebook photo still works. Of course, the only way to access such a deleted photo is by using the direct URL. A Facebook spokesperson defends the site’s slowness—"for all practical purposes, the photo no longer exists"—and says it's working with its content delivery network to shrink the amount of time that deleted photos remain in its cache. Even so, Cheng writes on Ars Technica, “If you don't want to give your enemies blackmail material, don't upload questionable photos in the first place.” Click here for more Facebook privacy flaps.

Anti-Donald Trump conservative activists have stepped up their efforts to find a third-party alternative, but they'll have to file their paperwork in Texas by May 9 to get on the ballot, with deadlines in other states following soon, the Hill reports. Possibilities include former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's 2012 nominee, and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who called for an alternative to Trump and Clinton in a Facebook post Thursday. Rick Perry had also been mentioned, but he earned the scorn of Trump foes on Thursday when he dismissed the idea as "quixotic," endorsed Trump, and said he would be open to becoming his running mate, reports USA Today. Conservative blogger Erick Erickson has taken a leading role in the search for a Trump alternative and plans to hold talks with like-minded conservatives in the days to come, CNN reports. "It's an uphill climb, everybody recognizes that, regardless of the route we go, but there are a lot of Republican donors sitting on the sidelines who would rather fund a third party than fund Donald Trump," he tells the Hill. He says campaign finance experts believe a third-party bid would cost at least $250 million. Trump meanwhile, has a different suggestion for a third-party candidate. "Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise," he tweeted Thursday. "He should show them, & run as an Independent."

Once again, Rand Paul is at the center of things, with Paul saying his stance against the surveillance is a fight for civil liberties and critics like John McCain accusing him of fundraising theatrics, reports the Washington Post. As things stand now, key parts of the Patriot Act are set to expire on June 1. The Senate has gone into recess, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is bringing everybody back on May 31 for a rare Sunday session to try to figure out a last-minute fix. “This is a high-threat period,” said McConnell, who maintains that even a brief lapse in the act is a threat to national security. All this became necessary when the Senate last night blocked a House compromise measure called the USA Freedom Act that would curb the surveillance programs. (Under the bill, the NSA would no longer collect metadata but could still gain access to it from phone companies.) When that failed, McConnell tried to extend the expiring Patriot Act provisions by one week, then four days, then two days, and then one day. All the extensions were rejected, one by one, thanks to Paul and help from Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich. The upshot is that it's now "almost a sure bet that portions of the Patriot Act" will expire at least temporarily, reports the Hill, which notes that the House is in recess through the end of May.

Among other things, he rejected the idea that President Trump is considering pardons and defended his own move to delete old tweets in which he was critical of Trump. Details: Pardons: "The president is thinking about pardoning nobody," he said on CNN, adding that Trump "is not going to have to pardon anybody because the Russian thing is a nonsensical thing." (Trump tweeted about the power of presidential pardons on Saturday.) Pardons, take II: Trump attorney Jay Sekulow also dismissed the idea of pardon discussions, per the Hill. “We have not and I continue to not have conversations with the president of the United States about pardons,” he said on ABC's This Week. Not convinced: Scaramucci said Trump is still not convinced Russia interfered in the election. "He basically said to me, 'Hey you know, this is, maybe they did it, maybe they didn't do it.'" He also said he was speaking with somebody recently who asserted that if the Russians did indeed meddle, they would leave behind no evidence of it. Upon questioning, he told Jake Tapper the person who said that was, in fact, Trump, per Politico. Deleting tweets: Earlier over the weekend, Scaramucci deleted old tweets critical of Trump, explaining that "past views evolved & shouldn't be a distraction." The Hill notes that Scaramucci also publicly apologized to Trump on Friday. Moving on: "If I said some things about [Trump] when I was working for another candidate, Mr. Trump, Mr. President, I apologize for that. Can we move on off of that?" he said Sunday. Old column: One piece of criticism gaining attention is a 2016 column Scaramucci wrote for Fox Business in which he warned about "unbridled demagoguery" taking over the GOP. He did not, however, mention Trump by name in the column. Maureen Dowd: In her New York Times column, Dowd describes Scaramucci as a "wealthy mini-me Manhattan bro" who has much in common with Trump, including a big ego. But she says the hire won't solve the president's big problem, that being the "existential threat" posed by special investigator Robert Mueller. Trump, she writes, doesn't get that Mueller is not some "contractor" he can bully and intimidate.

The strong showing has been "the victory that you have brought about." he told supporters at his primary night party. "I sort of have to chuckle when they describe you and me as being dangerous. That's one thing where they're telling the truth. We are dangerous to the status quo." Paul, in a speech that focused on the withdrawal of US troops from overseas, said the result was a sign of growing momentum for his beliefs, the AP reports. He received around 23% of the vote in New Hampshire—more than Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Rick Perry put together. Exit polls show he was the choice of 48% of voters under 25, and a third of all voters between 30 and 44, the Wall Street Journal notes.

The too-much singer flashed photogs when her slitted dress slitted a bit too much, gushes the New York Daily News, which spotted a piercing on the underwear-less Gaga. But Gawker was left wondering what exactly that was between Gaga's legs. The News blurred the flash for modesty's sake, while Gawker peered extremely carefully for curiosity's sake. Piercing? Creative undergarment? "Some weird panty hose camel toe situation?" wonders Brian Moylan. Even a helpful reader's use of the "Crotch-Shot Analyzer 5000" came up with an extremely mixed verdict.

The new accuser will appear with Allred at a press conference this afternoon, Radar Online reports. This woman, who will be the first to go public, says Cain harassed her when she went to him for help with an employment issue at the National Restaurant Association. For the uninitiated, Allred is fairly famous, USA Today notes, citing a New York Times article that described her as, “a feminist avenging crusader or a deluxe ambulance chaser catching a ride on the latest tabloid scandal.” (Click here for more on Allred and her mind-boggling list of clientele, or here for more on Cain's woes.)

Brian Ingberg says someone broke into his bar this week and stole a bottle of vodka valued at $1.3 million, Radio Free Europe reports. According to the AP, Ingberg says the bottle of Russo-Baltique was on loan from a Russian businessman. He says it has been in the 1,200-bottle vodka museum in his bar's basement in Copenhagen for the past six months, the Local reports. Ingberg says the one-of-a-kind bottle was uninsured and the only item stolen from the bar. As for what makes the Russo-Baltique vodka so expensive (it's allegedly the priciest bottle of vodka in the world): Ingberg says it comes from the Dartz factory, "which makes the world's most expensive cars and vodka." The Dartz Motorz Company in Latvia is known for making armored vehicles. The bottle itself is also unthinkably fancy, boasting more than 13 pounds of gold and silver, the leather from a 1912 Monte Carlo rally car, and a cap encrusted with diamonds. It was recently featured in an episode of House of Cards.

But legal woes and company infighting threaten to take down the fact-checking site after more than 20 years of internet sleuthing, reports Poynter. The company posted a plea to its readers Monday, writing that it was in danger of “closing its doors” due to a vendor that is holding the site and its advertising revenue “hostage.” The open letter reminds users of the importance of fact-checking in the era of #fakenews and links to a GoFundMe campaign started by founder and CEO David Mikkelson that asks for a suggested donation of $10. The viral campaign has raised nearly half of its $500,000 goal from thousands of patrons in its first nine hours. While Snopes’ letter doesn’t go into specifics about the mysterious vendor and its legal woes, the Atlantic offers a deep dive into the drama that landed Mikkelson’s parent company, Bardav, into this position. Married founders Barbara and David Mikkelson divorced in 2015, the same summer the couple joined forces with San Diego startup Proper Media to help modernize the site’s ancient backend and provide other services. A year later, Barbara ended up selling her 50% Bardav stake to be split between Proper Media’s owners. But a messy dispute prompted David Mikkelson to sever ties with Proper Media. He claims that though the company’s contract has been terminated, it “continues to insert [its] own ads and has been withholding the advertising revenue from us.” Meanwhile, Proper Media’s complaint claims otherwise, and its lawyer snapped back at Mikkelson’s campaign by asserting that Proper Media “is a 50% co-owner of Bardav.” (This story on how the debunking site began is worth a read.)

Problem was, Walker is serving 30 years in an Oklahoma jail for murdering a sheriff. Walker—a member of the Aryan Brotherhood gang—uploaded pics of himself posing with a home-made knife, a liquor bottle, a stash of marijuana, and the BlackBerry he used to post on Facebook. Facebook has now disabled Walker's profile because officials pointed out that it's illegal to possess a cell phone in Oklahoma jails, ABC News reports. Walker has now been moved to a maximum-security prison and placed in a segregation unit. He may face extra jail time for contraband found in his cell, and a prison spokesman tells the Oklahoman he definitely "won't be posting anything to Facebook again any time soon."

Trump is a "total disaster" who needs to go, Jimmy Kimmel told viewers. Trump supporters should "treat the situation like you would if you'd put Star Wars wallpaper up in the kitchen: 'All right, I got caught up. I was excited, I made a mistake, and now it needs to go,'" he said, per the New York Times. Kimmel suggested Trump be promoted to a king with no power. "We need to set him up in a castle ... lead him to the top and then lock the door to that castle—forever." Other reactions: Stephen Colbert. The Late Show host played a clip of Trump saying "I think there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and neither do you," and quipped: "The only thing I'm doubting right now is if you’re still going to be president by Friday," Mediaite reports. Colbert also poked fun at Trump for saying the white nationalists in Charlottesville had a permit for their protest. "You've got to give it to the Nazis," he said. "They always do their paperwork." James Corden. The CBS host mocked Trump for saying he waited until he had all the facts before commenting on Charlottesville. "It's true, he only makes a statement when he has the facts," he said. "You know, like when he told us how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history. Or that time he told us Meryl Streep was a bad actress." Seth Meyers. Meyers introduced a new segment called "Breaking Crazy" to deal with what he described as a "clinically insane" performance. "Trump is like a bad waitress in a crappy diner who’s trying to get fired so she can go to a concert," he said. "Congress, isn't this enough? Cut bait on the president." Conan O'Brien. "In the press conference, President Trump said that Steve Bannon was a good friend and not a racist," O'Brien said, per the Washington Post. "Then he said, 'Oops, I meant to say, 'a good racist, and not a friend.'" The Daily Show. The most-quoted remark from the show was a tweet hours before airtime: "Today is the day Donald Trump became president of the Confederacy."

According to USA Today, the unique giraffe was spotted as a calf last year in Tarangire National Park. It was seen again this month, almost exactly a year later, the Wild Nature Institute writes in a blog post. "We are thrilled that she is still alive and well," the nonprofit states. A tour guide named the pale animal Omo after a local laundry detergent, but the institute is open to other suggestions. Omo is leucistic, meaning most of her surface cells produce no pigment, explains the Wild Nature Institute. But unlike an albino, some of her cells—such as those in her eyes—can still manufacture color. The institute's founder, Dr. Derek Lee, tells the Telegraph that Omo is the only such giraffe they are aware of. “Omo appears to get along with the other giraffes; she has always been seen with a large group of normally colored giraffe," he says. "They don't seem to mind her different coloring.” But her uniqueness could make her a target for poachers, Lee says. The institute is currently working on anti-poaching efforts for all giraffes. “We hope that she lives a long life and that someday she has calves of her own,” says Lee.

The outage struck over 900 sites city-wide, the Detroit Free Press reports, shutting down nearly all traffic lights and trapping many people in elevators (firefighters are still performing rescues at downtown elevators as of this writing). Detroit officials say that as of mid-afternoon, about a third of power customers have service restored along with schools, government buildings, and other facilities. Mayor Mike Duggan says the outage is "another reminder of how much work we still have to do to rebuild the city," and notes that Detroit's four-year, $200 million upgrade to its decades-old electrical grid is still underway, the Detroit News reports.

Unless you're Massachusetts resident Judy Brown, who got the whole thing out of the way in about an hour. ABC News reports the 47-year-old went to the hospital Wednesday night with "severe abdominal pain" and what she thought was a gallstone or something. It turns out she was actually exceedingly pregnant. "To understand and take in that I was pregnant and was about to go into labor…it was very overwhelming," Brown says. According to WCVB, Brown thought the changes her body was going through over the past few months—including a growing belly—were just the process of getting older. "I felt like I was turning into my mother," she says. Approximately an hour after arriving at the hospital, Brown gave birth to a healthy baby girl—her first child, ABC reports. "Now I have a new purpose in life," Brown's husband Jason tells the Salem News. "I'm already a big kid myself, so now I have one to be with." But he says that's not going to stop him from getting surgery to make sure something like this never happens again, according to WCVB. Since it never occurred to the couple Brown might be pregnant, ABC reports they had to borrow a car seat and bassinet just to leave the hospital. It may seem bizarre, but this kind of thing isn't unheard of. "People don’t know sometimes, or they’re in denial about it," one doctor says. "And denial can be pretty strong." (Meanwhile, these women have given birth in some pretty strange places.)

Some early reaction to his news conference: Brian Wingfield, Forbes: "The public outcry over the disaster has left the administration little choice but to take ownership of resolving it, but in doing so the White House has also boxed itself into a corner. For every day the disaster and the cleanup efforts continue, the administration is squarely on the hook. ... Until the leak is plugged, expect (public) outrage to grow in proportion to the amount of oil in the Gulf of Mexico." Also, watch those predictions. Remember "Mission Accomplished"? Gus Lubin, Business Insider: Obama says it's been a priority from day one. "But here's the catch. For him to make that claim, Obama is forced to claim authority over the BP response from the start—saying he could have stepped in at any time. That means defending everything BP has done." This won't "go over well with a furious nation" or "Democrats in Congress who have pummeled BP." Chris Cillizza, Washington Post: Obama argued that the US is in control on strategy but needs BP's technological expertise. "It's a nuanced argument to make and a distinction that Obama has to hope average Americans understand."

Per People, Norris was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal adenocarcinoma in September, and that diagnosis has been an eye-opener for the 33-year-old mom from Kansas. In her note, Norris apologizes to her past cancer patients, noting how much pride she had previously taken in her rapport with them: "I really thought I got it ... what it felt like to go through this journey. I didn't," she says. What she didn't understand, more specifically: what it felt like to hear the diagnosis, how difficult the waiting is, how weird it feels to tell other people or to endure the "sad looks," or how tired, confused, guilty, suspicious, and even "crazy" a patient can feel. And she says she didn't realize how important her own role was. "I didn't get how much you hung on to every word I said to you," she says. "I used to tell you that cancer will be just a phase in your life. Just like high school or something … I'm sorry if this made you feel marginalized—it is not a phase." She also notes she didn't understand how tough it is to let others help, something she tells Us she's had to do herself, especially leaning on her husband, Camden, who's taken on more of the duties of caring for their 3-year-old son and 7-month-old daughter. Norris has been undergoing radiation and chemo and will have a follow-up checkup after Christmas. "I just hope that I was still able to give you a little guidance and strength to help you get through your cancer treatment. Even if I didn't get it," she writes. Her full post here.

The lethal injection for Roderick Nunley, 50, began a couple of minutes before 9pm and he was pronounced dead about 10 minutes later, per KBMC. Nunley—who St. Louis Radio reports requested a final meal of steak, shrimp, chicken strips, salad, and cheesecake, per a prison rep—had no one from his camp witness his death and made no final statement, though he met with his daughter and a spiritual adviser earlier in the day, the AP reports. The father of Ann Harrison, abducted in March 1989 by Nunley and Michael Taylor while waiting for her bus 20 yards from her front door, attended the execution, as did her uncle and two family friends, the AP notes. Taylor was executed last year. Some blame drawn-out appeals and an inefficient system for the executions' lengthy delay. "Nunley's case offers a textbook example showing why society is so frustrated with a system that has become too cumbersome," Missouri's AG said in a statement after the execution, per the AP. A retired Kansas City detective who tells KCTV the stalling was a "travesty" also told the AP this week "the delay in executing these two is just nuts because it didn't have anything to do with their guilt. It was legal mumbo-jumbo nonsense." After the execution, Ann's parents released a statement, per KCTV, that said, "Will the execution of Roderick Nunley and Michael Taylor bring a sense of closure for us and our younger daughters? We don't know," though they conceded "if this is the only form of closure we receive, then we will gladly take it." (A woman hopes the pope will ask for clemency for her son on death row in Texas.)

Today's decision means that starting Dec. 1, cigarettes will all come in olive green packages dominated by graphic health warnings with images like blinded eyeballs and cancerous mouths, reports Reuters. The brand name will appear only in a small generic font at the bottom of the package. Tobacco companies, which fear the move will inspire similar laws worldwide and wipe billions from the value of their brands, argued that the law would deprive them of copyright, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. "No longer when a smoker pulls out a packet of cigarettes will that packet be a mobile billboard," Australia's attorney general and health minister said in a joint statement. A spokesman for British American Tobacco said the company was disappointed by the ruling and claimed that the only people that will benefit will be organized crime groups selling counterfeit cigarettes, as making all packets nearly identical will also make them easier to copy. Australia's health minister countered that steps will be taken to prevent counterfeiting, like placing alphanumeric codes on authentic packages.

The Times notes two key communications came into play: calls made by the "kill team" to a top bin Salman aide, as well as calls with the crown prince himself. Although bin Salman is never heard directly ordering Khashoggi's assassination on the intercepts, sources say he can be heard mulling over ways to get Khashoggi back to Riyadh. The CIA also based its conclusion on the fact that the crown prince is, in effect, the ruler of a kingdom in which nothing big happens without his OK. "The accepted position is that there is no way this happened without him being aware or involved," a US official tells the Post. One particularly critical phone call, said to have been made at bin Salman's direction, was one placed by his brother, Khalid bin Salman, to Khashoggi, in which Khalid told the journalist he should head over to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to get his marriage papers, and that he'd be OK doing that. Arab News reports that Khalid is pushing back on those claims, ripping into the Post on Twitter for publishing such a "serious accusation" that he says "should not be left to anonymous sources." "As we told the Washington Post the last contact I had with Mr. Khashoggi was via text on Oct 26 2017," he noted in a tweet. "I never talked to him by phone and certainly never suggested he go to Turkey for any reason. I ask the US government to release any information regarding this claim."

One mom offers an unusual remedy that goes against standard medical advice: Give the youngster coffee, she writes at the Stir blog at Cafe Mom. Christie Haskell didn’t want her hyperactive son diagnosed with ADHD, so she tried her own cure: The 7-year-old drinks coffee with breakfast. Ritalin’s “not exactly a shining success story,” but it’s a stimulant, boosting blood flow to the brain and helping people focus. Coffee’s a stimulant, too. “One hundred mg of caffeine actually accomplishes a lot of the same things as 5mg of Ritalin ... but obviously, without many of the potential risks,” Haskell writes. Some moms are even handing out low-dose caffeine pills, she adds. Still, “just to be clear, we're not exactly following doctor's orders here,” she points out, and "we're not talking about every kid here, either."

The temple of wood and clay, which measures 197 feet by 66 feet, contains lots of animal bones—perhaps the remains of animals sacrificed on the building's eight platforms made of clay. The upper floor, which has five rooms, is "decorated by red paint, which created [a] ceremonial atmosphere," researchers say. They first spotted the temple in 2009 in a 1,200-building settlement that's double the size of the National Mall in Washington, LiveScience notes. That settlement and others like it are associated with what's now known as "Trypillian" culture. And like similar sites, after inhabitants left the settlement behind, it was burned down, the researchers note. In addition to the bones, the temple contained pieces of pottery and the remains of human-like figurines, as well as what appear to be game pieces and golden hair decorations, LiveScience reports with images.

The nation's retired Kumaris will soon get the equivalent of about $160 a month, reports the Economic Times. Kumaris, for the uninitiated, are young girls chosen to be worshiped as the aforementioned living goddesses, a title they have to give up once they reach puberty. Hence, the new pensions, which as of now will go to 10 ex-goddesses. "Although most of the Kumaris come from well-to-do families, they miss a vital period of their lives and often lag behind in our increasingly competitive society," a government official tells AFP. The government also will try to make sure the girls get proper education and job training once they lose their status, reports the Hindustan Times, which adds that the tradition of worshiping pre-pubescent girls dates back to the 17th century.

Sana Muhammad, 35, was eight months pregnant when she was attacked Monday morning in front of her five other children. Police say her ex-husband Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 50, hid in the Muhammad family's garden shed before attacking her in their kitchen. The arrow missed the baby by just inches, and was still lodged in Muhammad's abdomen when doctors delivered the infant via emergency C-section. Imtiaz Muhammad, the victim's husband of seven years, tells the Evening Standard he was taking some boxes to the shed when he found Unmathallegadoo waiting with a loaded crossbow, about to shoot. Muhammad ran into the house yelling for his wife to run, but Unmathallegadoo shot her. "I can't help thinking she took my arrow," Muhammad says. "Maybe it should have hit me. The kids were all there, it was horrific." Friends say the Muhammads had a 1-year-old and a 4-year-old together plus the baby whose due date was four weeks away, and the victim also had 12-, 15-, and 17-year-old children with her ex. Unmathallegadoo has been charged with murder, and baby Ibrahim is in a critical care unit due to his premature birth. He was said to be in stable condition, the BBC reports. (Another unimaginably horrible crossbow story.)

KTXL reports a semi-truck carrying millions of bees worth between $1 million and $2 million crashed Thursday night in California. The driver told police he had to swerve onto a freeway off ramp when traffic suddenly stopped, causing him to crash. Hundreds of hives—the bees were coming from Montana to pollinate almond trees—were damaged in the crash. Beekeepers told police there was no way to save the colonies, so the bees were euthanized by spraying the hives with soapy water.

Though the advent of military sonar in the 1950s coincided with a spike in strandings, one of the researchers involved explains that an unknown piece of the puzzle has been how—and even whether—whales respond to the noise. In one study off Southern California, a simulated military sonar signal was sounded at levels well below the military's threshold, at distances between roughly 2 and 6 miles from two beaked whales that had been studded with suction cups; that particular species was chosen because it is most regularly the victim of mass strandings. The result: The whales first stopped feeding (and didn't resume eating for as long as seven hours, which is unusual) and swimming, then high-tailed it away from the noise and were observed to have taken longer dives. A second study in the same region suggested that blue whales' feeding was similarly disrupted; a creature lost the equivalent of a day's meal, which a researcher says could "have significant and previously undocumented impacts" on the animals' health. But he called the responses "complex," with PhysOrg noting that not all the whales reacted in the same way—and some didn't react at all. The US Navy provided funding for the studies, which it points out only concern behavior, not any eventual harm. (In other fascinating whale news, scientists have figured out how the creatures can hold their breath underwater.)

The French president had to acknowledge his affair with an actress, a growing mess that sent his other girlfriend to the hospital. And now? Manure, and lots of it, dumped in his name outside the French parliament in Paris, reports AFP. "Out with Hollande and the whole political class!" said the message on the protester's tractor-trailer. (BuzzFeed has photos.) It's not clear that the protester had Hollande's affair in mind, but the president nonetheless has the worst popularity ratings "of any leader in modern-day France," notes Reuters. Police arrested the protester before he got all the manure unloaded.

Paul Ryan's proposal wouldn't have changed anything for people already 55 and older, and it would only have altered—not ended—Medicare for others, says the non-partisan fact-checking website. It points to "nine separate fact-checks" invalidating the Democrats' claim. Simply replacing "end Medicare" with "privatize Medicare" would have been a big improvement, the site suggests. But PolitiFact acknowledges that a number of key voices—among them Talking Points Memo, the Daily Kos, and Paul Krugman—disagree. (The Huffington Post's headline was "Politi-Fail.") Indeed, the Washington Monthly calls PolitiFact's analysis "indefensible." "The House Republican budget plan intended to privatize the existing system and replace it with something very different—a voucher scheme," writes Steve Benen. "It would still be called 'Medicare,' but it wouldn’t be Medicare." (Click to read how Ryan has since altered his plan.)

After the video went viral on Monday, resource officer Ben Fields was shifted to administrative duties pending an investigation, the State reports, and the school district says Fields has been told "not to return to any school in the district." A Richland County Sheriff's Department spokesman says the girl, who was still seated when Fields flipped her desk over, was arrested for disturbing the peace. A fellow Spring Valley High School student tells NBC News that the officer was called in after the girl refused a request to leave the classroom. The girl shows no sign of resistance during the video, and in a longer version, Fields can be heard threatening to arrest a student who objected, reports Reuters. A sheriff's office spokesman tells the State that the sheriff has seen the video and "was very disturbed by what he saw." NBC reports that a 2013 lawsuit accused Fields, who is white, of "unfairly and recklessly" targeting "African-American students with allegations of gang membership and criminal gang activity." Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin issued a statement calling the officer's behavior unacceptable and asking for an independent investigation, the State reports.

It must be true because Mayor Bloomberg and police chief Ray Kelly keeping trumpeting the stat, and the media keep circulating it. (Like in this profile.) ProPublica took a look at the NYPD's own list of the 14 to test the accuracy of the claim. "Is it true? In a word, no," writes Justin Elliott. The boast "overstates both the number of serious, developed terrorist plots against New York and exaggerates the NYPD's role in stopping attacks." Of the 14, ProPublica says two, maybe three, qualify as true terror threats. And that includes "a failed attempt to bomb Times Square by a Pakistani-American in 2010 that the NYPD did not stop." What's more, the NYPD doesn't seem to have played a big role in most of the busts. "In several cases, it played no role at all." See the full article and a breakdown of the 14 cases here. (Asked about the story today, Bloomberg responded: “I could make as cogent an argument there’s double or triple the number that were stopped. We just don’t know about it." More on that here.)

As many as 2,000 vets will arrive in North Dakota on Sunday with the goal of "protecting the protesters," Marine Corps veteran Anthony Diggs says. “There is a lot of power in veterans from all over, from all branches of the military, coming together to create a protecting front against the police, who are militarized themselves,” he says. But the vets aren't just bringing symbolism; they've raised around half a million dollars to help protesters get through the winter and are bringing supplies, lawyers, and more. The vets are expected to arrive the day before the Army Corp of Engineers had ordered protesters to abandon their camp on federal land. But while the Army Corps has since said it won't force protesters off the land, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple issued an "emergency evacuation" of the camp Monday in the face of an oncoming blizzard, Reuters reports. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says it has no plans to move, and its chairman points out it's ironic that Dalrymple is suddenly concerned about cold protesters days after police sprayed them with fire hoses. Contrary to previous reports, Dalrymple won't block food and supplies from getting to protesters as part of the evacuation, according to the AP. A spokesperson says that had been "misconstrued."

Researchers concluded that after Los Angeles authorities shut down hundreds of dispensaries last year, crime actually increased around the closed facilities. The victory proved short-lived: Rand has pulled the controversial study for review after the LA city attorney and other officials demanded its retraction, reports the Los Angeles Times. “As we’ve begun to take a look at the report, we decided it’s best to remove it from circulation until that review is complete," said a spokesman. The city attorney had criticized the study—which compared crime stats in particular areas 10 days before the dispensaries shut down and 10 days after—as "highly suspect and unreliable."

It makes for rough reading. The stories quote doctors and investigators who describe gouged eyes and dismembered bodies hanging from hooks. One doctor says every body suffered some kind of abuse. By the current count, the militants killed at least 67 people, and another 61 remain missing, reports AP. The missing are presumably still buried in the rubble that resulted when three floors of the mall collapsed during the army's counter-attack. Meanwhile, the BBC reports that the militants were able to launch such a well-armed assault because they had previously rented a shop in the mall and posed as business owners. In the weeks leading up to the attack, they were able to bring in hidden weapons via service elevators and stockpile them in the shop.

Here are excerpts of the BBC interviews released Wednesday ahead of Diana, 7 Days, which chronicles the week following their mother's death, via the AP and the Guardian: On Prince Charles: "One of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died," said Harry. "How you deal with that I don't know, but, you know, he was there for us." Paparazzi: "One of the hardest things to come to terms with is the people who chased her into the tunnel were the same people who were taking photographs of her while she was still dying on the back seat of the car," said Harry. "Those people [who] caused the accident instead of helping were taking photographs of her dying on the back seat." Bangs helped: "I just remember hiding behind my fringe [of hair] basically, at a time when I had a lot of hair, and my head's down a lot—so I'm hiding behind my fringe," William said of his 15-year-old self. "It was kind of like a tiny bit of safety blanket if you like. I know it sounds ridiculous, but at the time I felt if I looked at the floor and my hair came down over my face, no one could see me." Queen's protection: "At the time, you know, my grandmother wanted to protect her two grandsons, and my father as well," said William. "Our grandmother deliberately removed the newspapers, and things like that, so there was nothing in the house at all. So we didn't know what was going on." On walking behind the casket: "I just kept thinking about what she would want and that she'd be proud of Harry and I being able to go through it, effectively she was there with us, it felt like she was almost walking along beside us, to get us through it," said William. The documentary airs Sunday in Britain on BBC1 and premieres in the US on Sept. 1 on NBC, per Vogue.

Officers say they've uncovered a single bar worth up to $500,000 in South Florida, though they won't specify how or exactly where they came across it. They are saying, however, that the 26-pound bar was on the truck that was robbed by armed men in North Carolina while en route from Miami to Massachusetts on March 1. "This confirms that there is a South Florida nexus to this crime," an FBI investigator says, per ABC News. "We believe that additional gold bars from the robbery may still be in South Florida and we continue to need the public's help in solving this crime." The FBI has added a $25,000 reward for information on the case to the $50,000 reward already offered by TransValue, the company that was transporting the gold. Its guards said they were approached by at least two Spanish-speaking men after they had pulled over due to mechanical issues—a claim that is still under investigation, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. The men identified themselves as "Policia" before tying up the guards and leading them into the woods, officers say. Police previously believed the suspects could be tied to Florida because a traffic cone placed behind the van in which the gold was loaded during the robbery featured the marking of a company that only does work in the state.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the pope took Europe to task today during a speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, calling the continent "elderly and haggard" and "no longer fertile and vibrant"—not to mention "fearful and self-absorbed," "a grandmother," and "slowly losing its own soul," per the New York Times and BBC. He focused on Europe's struggles with immigration and youth unemployment. Among the highlights: "We cannot allow the Mediterranean to become a vast cemetery," he says of immigrants who have died trying to reach European shores—including over 3,000 who didn't survive journeys to Italy in old boats. "The great ideas which once inspired Europe seem to have lost their attraction, only to be replaced by the bureaucratic technicalities of its institutions," he says. Yet he also warned of capitalism, saying that "men and women risk being reduced to mere cogs in a machine that treats them as items of consumption to be exploited." His solution for rampant youth unemployment: "The time has come to promote policies that create employment" by “joining market flexibility with the need for stability and security" for employees. The visit was only Francis' second inside of Europe (the Muslim-majority nation of Albania was first) and marked his shortest trip abroad at barely four hours. Strasbourg residents were able to see his talk on a big screen in the city's cathedral, but not all were thrilled with the arrangement: "He knows what he is doing but we would have liked him to be here," says a worshipper.

The president's personal assistant, John McEntee, was abruptly fired and escorted out of the White House over some kind of security clearance issue, reports the Wall Street Journal. White House officials won't provide details, but CNN reports that McEntee is under investigation by Homeland Security for "serious financial crimes" unrelated to the president. Almost immediately after losing his White House job, however, the 27-year-old McEntee was hired by the Trump campaign as an adviser. The Hartfort Courant has taken note of the news for an odd reason: It seems that McEntee once played quarterback for the University of Connecticut, and he posted a video of trick throws on YouTube back in 2011 that now has more than 7 million views. McEntee first joined the Trump campaign as a volunteer before being hired full time to serve as Trump's "body man." The Journal describes examples of his former duties: "He made sure Mr. Trump had markers to sign autographs, delivered messages to him in the White House residence and, over the weekend, ensured that the clocks in the White House residence were adjusted for daylight-saving time." (Trump also lamented the recent loss of Hope Hicks.)

This year he gave them to her for the last time, in a hospital room, as she lay dying from a gunshot wound to the head sustained in an apparent road-rage incident, reports ABC News. The Las Vegas nurse and mom of four died Saturday. Two days earlier, Tammy Meyers had taken the couple's teen daughter to a school parking lot to practice driving; on the way home, she got in a confrontation with people in another car, who proceeded to follow her and her daughter home. At this point her daughter reportedly ran into the house, Tammy Meyers stepped out of the car as gunshots were fired, and her 23-year-old son ran out firing at the vehicle in response. The suspect is described as a white male, about 25 years of age, roughly 6 feet tall and 180 pounds. "My word to them is I hope the cops find them first and it's not me," Bob Meyers tells NBC. "I have four kids. I just want to let you suspects know you took a mom away." Police say the suspect may have been driving a four-door gray or silver sedan that may have both front side damage and bullet damage. Tammy's family has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover hospital and funeral expenses. "Tammy was a nurse, mother of 4, and the most giving person one could ever know," it reads. "Her family has chosen to make Tammy's life mean even more by donating her organs and providing the gift of life." (Last fall, a mother of four was shot to death in a road rage incident where she wasn't even driving.)

"Plunges" and "plummets" are the common verbs Friday morning, with the price of the cryptocurrency falling more than $3,000 to below $13,000 on some exchanges before rebounding a bit, reports CNBC. That's down from a high of $19,000-plus in a week. In fact, the sharp drops triggered temporary halts in trading on two major futures exchanges, CBOE and CME, that recently began working with Bitcoin. “Has the bubble finally popped? It’s hard to see the bell tolling just yet," an analyst at ETC Capital tells the Guardian. "Large price swings have become so normal that it’s hard to decide." He sees a few factors at play in the year-end drop, including the hack of a major exchange in South Korea and some high-profile public infighting in the Bitcoin community. On the latter point, Bloomberg has details on some "Bitcoin whales" jumping ship.

Per Hollywood Life, Sam Sarpong, 40, an ex-Tommy Hilfiger model and former co-host of MTV's Yo Momma reality-TV game show, jumped from Pasadena's Colorado Street Bridge and was pronounced dead by paramedics at 3:52pm, according to a release from the Pasadena Police Department; the LA County coroner ruled Sarpong's death a suicide, with an autopsy to come, Variety reports. Law enforcement had rushed to the bridge Monday morning after a witness spotted Sarpong standing outside the bridge's railing. Police closed off the area under the bridge as well as the bridge itself while they tried to talk him off his perch, but he ultimately jumped into the river underneath the bridge, Deadline reports. Sarpong, who was born in London, moved to LA when he was 11 and eventually started modeling, including a six-year stint with Tommy Hilfiger, as well as Versace, Gucci, and other big names, Variety notes. He nabbed the MTV spot in 2006 and had a slew of other TV credits to his name, including parts on ER, Boston Public, and 24. He'll also be featured in next year's much-hyped American Crime Story: The People v. OJ Simpson on FX. "[Sarpong] had a pure heart and always went out of his way to help others," his rep tells the magazine. "We will all miss him dearly." His MTV co-host also had something to say about the tragic news, CBS Los Angeles reports. "I am so sad & so confused," Wilmer Valderrama posted on Instagram. "Sam did it all, believed in dreaming bigger than anyone around him. … And to everyone in a dark place.. PLEASE, please talk to someone.. Anyone."

"I fear that there's going to be an assassination … I really worry that somebody is going to be killed," the Republican senator from Kentucky told WHAS on Tuesday, referring to Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and ongoing protests in Washington. "Those who are ratcheting up the conversation, they have to realize they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence," he added, referencing Sen. Cory Booker's call in June for activists concerned with ending homelessness to "get up in the face of some congresspeople," per the Hill. "What he doesn't realize is that for every 1,000 persons who want to get up in your face, one of them is going to be unstable enough to commit violence," Paul said, per Time. "When I was at the ballfield and Steve Scalise was nearly killed, the guy shooting up the ballfield … was yelling, 'This is for health care.'" His comments echoed a recent CNN op-ed by his wife, Kelley Paul, who also called out Booker. "Preventing someone from moving forward, thrusting your middle finger in their face, screaming vitriol—is this the way to express concern or enact change?" she wrote. Describing "violence and threats of violence at a horrifying level," she added, "I now keep a loaded gun by my bed."

He makes up for it with a touching tribute to his friend and co-star on his blog, writing that his world is "about 134% less funny" without the quick-to-laugh Dunn in it. But Dunn could also be serious, and was a "great listener," always available to talk over a game of pool. "Ryan also had an enormous capacity to love. His friends and family got a lot, but a lion's share of that went to his sweet and beautiful Angie," Knoxville continues, noting that Dunn was always wondering out loud how he got such a great girlfriend.

It's not clear exactly what that means, but a communique states flatly, "There will be no State of the Union Address on the web tonight." A second one reaffirms the point. Why?

That number may soon go up even further. A security research firm tells CBS News a "really simple" hack could make the service decidedly less secure. With Amazon Key, launched last month, delivery drivers use an app to unlock the front door, drop a package off, and lock the door behind them all while being monitored via a wireless camera. But Rhino Security Labs says a de-authentication attack on the Wi-Fi router could take that camera offline. What's worse, Wired reports doing so wouldn't suspiciously send the camera to black but just freeze it on the last scene it recorded—such as a harmlessly closed door. This security flaw could be used in two ways. The delivery driver could drop off the package and leave the house but not lock the door, disable the camera using a computer of any kind, then re-enter the home and lock the door. To a user monitoring through the Amazon Key app, this would make everything appear fine while the driver roams about their home. A hacker following a delivery driver could also disable the digital lock and camera just before the driver locks the home. Amazon says the flaw isn't with its Amazon Key software but rather one that is inherent in Wi-Fi routers. It says a de-authentication attack is "unlikely" but it will release a software update to "more quickly provide notification if the camera goes offline during delivery."

Sessions—a longstanding Trump ally who was the first GOP senator to support his candidacy—made the offer in recent weeks after Trump was infuriated by his decision to recuse himself from the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling, sources tell ABC News and the Wall Street Journal. The sources say Trump was deeply disappointed by Sessions' decision, which he viewed as a sign of weakness, though the president rejected the AG's offer to resign. Sessions recused himself from the investigation after it emerged that during his confirmation hearings, he had failed to disclose meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Sources tell the Washington Post that Trump considers the decision to be a major factor behind the appointment of a special counsel to lead the Russia probe. Trump has also complained about the Justice Department's handling of his attempt to ban travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment Tuesday when asked whether Trump still has faith in the attorney general. "I have not had that discussion with him," Spicer said.

The Australian bride, who married Saturday at a country club in southwest Sydney, was nearly hit by an unruly and allegedly quite drunk wedding guest after he got in an argument with other guests, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The 55-year-old apparently jumped into his Mazda 3 around 9:30pm, raced toward two people he narrowly missed, and when someone tried to take his keys from the ignition, reversed at high speed toward another group, this one including the bride. He managed to avoid everyone, and no one was injured. Wedding photographer Warren Donovan tells Australia's ABC News that the guest, believed to be the partner of a relative of the couple, was "well and truly" drunk, but he adds that the couple, while shaken, "sort of went, 'We're not going to let this ruin the night.'" The man was found around midnight on foot, at which point police also confiscated marijuana. He was charged with menacing and dangerous driving, disqualified driving, and possession of a prohibited drug; he's due in court at the end of the month. (This bride-to-be was stabbed after her own bachelorette party.)

"Understand what's at stake here: It's whether we're going forward or going backward," Obama told a crowd of 1,500 at Northeastern University. "As much progress as we've made, I can't do it alone." Coakley's rival, Scott Brown, said on a bus tour across the state that he would make the Senate Democrats "start over," reports the Los Angeles Times. "As the 41st senator, I will make sure we do it better," he told crowds who responded by chanting "41" —the number of Senate votes Republicans need to filibuster legislation. Brown is up 51% to Coakley's 46% in the latest numbers from Public Policy Polling.

That means Taylor, who is in his mid-30s and has fathered four children, could go to jail if he impregnates someone during the five years he's on probation, 19 Action News reports. He plans to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court on the grounds that he has a constitutional right to procreate, says his attorney. The appeals court didn't address the legal merits of the original 2013 court order, saying it didn't have the necessary information—specifically a pre-sentencing report—to do so, reports AP. But one of the three judges wrote a separate opinion that backed up the reasoning. “Where, as here, the defendant has demonstrated a long-term refusal to support multiple children by multiple women notwithstanding his ability to work and contribute something for their care, an anti-procreation condition is reasonably related to future criminality."

There were precious few signs of progress in fiscal cliff negotiations yesterday, with both sides mainly making political statements blaming each other. Here's the latest: John Boehner, unable to pass even his own "Plan B," is now calling on the Senate to solve the problem. "The House will take action on whatever the Senate can pass, but the Senate first must act," he said, according to the New York Times. But Harry Reid points out that the Senate has already passed a bill that would prevent tax increases on all households making less than $250,000. "The Senate has already rejected House Republicans' Tea Party bills," he said, calling on Republicans to "drop their knee-jerk obstruction." Boehner hasn't called House members back to Washington yet, so though a session is scheduled for 2pm, it'll likely recess immediately. Senators are set to return this evening, but will have no proposal to consider. No Senate deal can pass without Mitch McConnell's approval, but a spokesman says neither Reid nor President Obama has reached out to him. The LA Times reports that McConnell helped devise Boehner's Plan B, but with re-election looming, McConnell is reluctant to get involved. "I cannot emphasize how little a constructive role he will play," says one Democratic strategist. Aides in both parties tell the Washington Post that the most logical step would be for Harry Reid to amend the House bill to let taxes rise for the wealthy and to extend unemployment benefits—without addressing the debt ceiling or making major spending cuts. President Obama will be back in Washington by noon, after a Hawaiian holiday vacation, according to the Hill. His aides have been in contact with Harry Reid's office in recent days, but their conversations haven't included Republicans, the AP reports. Democrats increasingly believe Republicans will wait to act until after Boehner is re-elected speaker on Jan. 3. "I think there's some chance that we get a deal done in the early weeks of January," one representative said yesterday, "which technically means you're going over the cliff."

Kirsten Gillibrand expressing anger at the harassment of women in the military. This time, she was grilling Marines chief Gen. Robert Neller in the wake of the revelation that photos and videos of female Marines, sometimes nude, had been widely shared in online groups. One exchange, via ABC News, sums it up: Gillibrand: "It is a serious problem when we have members of our military denigrating female Marines who will give their life to this country in the way they have, with no response from leadership. So if you're dedicated to fixing the culture of the Marines and all the services, what do you plan to do to hold commanders responsible who fail to get this done?" Neller: "I'm responsible. I'm the commandant. I own this, and we are going to have to, you know, you've heard it before, but we're going to have to change how we see ourselves and how we do—how we treat each other. That's a lame answer, but ma'am, that's the best I can tell you right now. We've got to change, and that's on me." The New York Times, meanwhile, has the story of one of the women victimized. Savannah Cunningham, a 19-year-old in Phoenix, made a nude video for a Marine she was dating in a long-distance relationship, and it surfaced in the online forums. Cunningham wasn't in the military at the time, but, despite the harassment she endured over the video, ships out for basic training next month. “Someone needs to stand up and say this does not represent the values of the Marine Corps,” she tells the newspaper. “If not me, then who?” A story in the Navy Times shows the challenge: It confirms that the scandal is not confined to the Marines, with women from at least a dozen Navy commands also specifically targeted in the online forums, likely by other sailors.

An online uproar ensued this week after a federal advisory panel recommended killing 45,000 such horses and burros, but Reuters reports that no such plans are in the works. It quotes a spokesman for the US Bureau of Land Management as saying in an email that the agency will "continue its current policy of caring for unadopted or unsold wild horses and burros" and will "not sell or send any animals to slaughter." Left unclear, however, is whether that decision could change when the agency formally responds to the advisory panel's recommendation months from now. The animals are currently being kept in off-range corrals after being removed from lands mostly in the West to prevent overgrazing. The first option is to try to have people adopt the animals, but the BLM says it can find nowhere near the number of necessary takers, and so spends about $50 million a year caring for the animals. The BLM estimates that in addition to the animals rounded up, another 67,000 are roaming wild, up from 58,000 just last year, reports the Christian Science Monitor. A lack of natural predators helps explain the jump.

Richard Bull, 32, was apparently using his iPhone in the bath when it slipped into the water and electrocuted him, the Telegraph reports. Coroner Sean Cummings said he plans to write to Apple to warn of the danger. "These seem like innocuous devices, but they can be as dangerous as a hairdryer in a bathroom. They should attach warnings," he told the inquest, per the Guardian. "This was a tragic accident and I have no reason to believe at all that there was anything other than it being completely accidental." Bull, who had used an extension cord from the hallway of his London home to bring the phone into the bath while it charged, suffered burns so severe that when his wife found his body, she thought he had been attacked and called police. The rugby player had been getting ready to meet family members and exchange Christmas presents. "When you are younger you are taught about electricity and the bath, but you don't think about this," his brother Andrew said. "I still find it hard to believe that between the charger plug and the phone would be enough electricity to kill someone." (The NYPD says keeping a phone under your pillow is also a bad idea.)

The latest development: The New York Times reports that she requested research into billionaire George Soros after he went after Facebook. Sandberg sent an email to the company's communications team requesting the research after Soros called Facebook a "menace to society" at a global forum in January. Sandberg has been downplaying her role in the opposition research conducted on Soros and other Facebook critics ever since an earlier Times report revealed that Facebook had hired a firm called Definers Public Affairs. But the email, which BuzzFeed reports Facebook confirmed, suggests she played a larger role than first acknowledged. A Facebook statement downplayed the significance of the new report, saying Sandberg wanted to know if Soros stood to gain financially from his criticism. “Mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,” the company said. “That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook's stock." Sandberg initially said she was unaware Facebook had hired Definers, then acknowledged that some of its work had shown up on her desk. A spokesman for an anti-Facebook coalition called Freedom From Facebook said Sandberg has lost credibility. "In light of Sandberg’s continuously changing story on the Soros research, there's no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value," said Eddie Vale. He called on Facebook to release all emails about its opposition research. (Mark Zuckerberg says neither he nor Sandberg will be leaving the company anytime soon.)

High points included the cold open, which got in a few solid shots at BP and Halliburton; the coke-bender-themed digital short; a school athletic awards sketch that "was essentially Alec Baldwin saying incredibly mean things about schoolchildren for three minutes"; and the return of "Nasim Pedrad as Bedelia, the teenager who thinks her parents are just the coolest."

While amyloid plaques have been found in several species of aging primates, the tau tangles found in people have never been spotted outside of humans—until now. Reporting in the journal Neurobiology of Aging, researchers say they've discovered them in our closest relative, the chimpanzee. Since chimps were declared endangered in the US in 2015, research on them has been dramatically restricted, and invasive research is banned, making MRI scans on aging chimps unlikely. But a new center that obtains the brains of chimps who died at zoos or research centers enabled this study, reports Science. Twenty brains that belonged to chimps who'd died between the ages of 37 and 62 (the latter is about 120 in human years) were analyzed; 13 had amyloid plaques and four of those had tau tangles. Still, chimps don't display severe dementia. "They're missing something," an outside neuropathologist tells Scientific American. It's possible the proteins are folded differently to protect them, which has the potential to inform human treatment. At the very least, they're the only other animal known to display Alzheimer's pathologic signature. (Many people being treated for Alzheimer's may not have it.)

The lead researcher from Denmark's Aarhus University tells the BBC that the switch is much like adjusting a flashlight. If you're looking for your car in a parking lot, "you could use a narrow beam over a long distance and still see a lot," she says. "But when you're trying to get your keys into the car, you would switch to a wider beam. This is similar to what we see in porpoises." The beam is controlled by a fatty structure in the porpoise's head called the melon. "Like some bats, harbor porpoises can broaden their biosonar beam during the terminal phase of attack but, unlike bats, maintain the ability to change beamwidth within this phase," the researchers write in the journal eLife. The team, which studied harbor porpoises in a semi-enclosed research facility that gave the animals seafloor access, believes other dolphins and whales have the same sonar ability. The lead researcher tells the BBC that the discovery suggests many porpoises end up in fishing nets because of "attention blindness" that causes them to ignore potential hazards as they zero in on a fish. (Porpoises in San Francisco Bay face another hazard: gangs of angry young dolphins.)

Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their five children were executed in 1918 as White Army forces closed in on the Bolsheviks holding them prisoner. Remains identified as the parents and three children (Olga, Tatyana, and Anastasia) were interred in a St. Petersburg cathedral in 1998. Body parts identified as those of Alexei and his sister Maria were found in 2007 about 45 miles south of the first grave, reports Interfax. Those remains were never buried, and Russia had announced burial plans this month. But the Russian Orthodox Church called for further investigation. The church has canonized the family, and it believes worshipping false relics would be sacrilege—and does not consider the other remains authentic, despite earlier DNA tests. And so yesterday "the samples were taken from the remains of Nicholas II and Alexandra at the Peter and Paul Fortress as well as the samples of [Nicolas' grandfather] Alexander II's clothes," a senior investigator with the Russian Investigative Committee tells Interfax. The remains of Alexandra's sister, the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, ended up in Jerusalem after she was killed in Russia in 1918, and investigators will now be allowed to access them for the first time, the BBC reports.

The sides also have different stories for what caused the blast; rebels say it was the result of government shelling, while the government says it was an accident at a rebel bomb-making factory, the AP reports. A BBC correspondent says the level of devastation is too heavy for conventional shelling, though activists have raised the possibility that it could have been a Scud missile. They're urging UN observers to visit Hama to investigate, and calling for an emergency UN Security Council meeting, the AFP reports. The Syrian National Council says more than 100 have died in Hama in recent days, and they want military intervention to protect civilians.

Or, more accurately, he wants you and everyone you know to print out whatever portion of the Internet strikes your fancy and mail it to him. "We just want shitloads of paper," the poet/conceptual artist writes on the project's Tumblr page. "We're literally looking for folks to print out the entire Internet. We have over 500 square meters of space to fill." This is, as you might have guessed, not a practical endeavor; it's an exhibition for the LABOR gallery in Mexico City, intended to honor hacker/activist Aaron Swartz. "The amount of what he liberated was enormous," Goldsmith tells Yahoo Tech. He admits that the whole Internet, or even a real chunk, would "overwhelm any space," but he wants to "literally materialize the amount of information around us." He's hoping the result will live on after the exhibition closes, traveling and growing—but if not, it'll all be recycled.

The father of the woman he killed, meanwhile, offers this assessment to a German newspaper: "If it didn't happen the way he says it did, he must suffer and he will suffer," says Barry Steenkamp. "It does not matter how much he has and how good his legal team is, he will have to live with his conscience. But if he speaks the truth, I can perhaps some day forgive him." Pistorius, who maintains that he mistook Reeva Steenkamp for a burglar, is not due back in court until June 4, and his coach says he might put the Olympian back into training as soon as Monday, reports the Daily Mail. His relatives sent a bouquet of flowers to Reeva's mother, but it does not appear to have gone over well. "What does it mean?" asks June Steenkamp. "Nothing." Also today, CNN reports that Pistorius' brother had his Twitter account hacked, and the family is now canceling its social media accounts as a result.

Matt Ivy shared the footage from Saturday in a desperate attempt to get 10-week-old Chipper back; in it, two men can be seen pulling up to the gated yard in Mesquite, Texas, before one jumps out, grabs Chipper from over a fence, and carries him off as he yelps and two adult dogs in the yard bark at the men. Ivy, a Dallas firefighter who's also a dog breeder, also created a GoFundMe campaign to raise reward money for the Dogue de Bordeaux or French mastiff puppy, which is valued at $3,000. On Wednesday, Ivy and Chipper were reunited "thanks to the help of media and local citizens," per FOX 4. "Somebody sold Chipper to a good man that called me and returned him," Ivy explained on his Facebook page. "Sorry it's so short, police have asked me to keep details minimal." Police are still looking for the suspects, the Dallas News reports. Ivy says he started breeding French mastiffs after seeing the movie Turner and Hooch. "They told me that's just a mutt. You'll never find one," he tells FOX 4. "Flipped through a dog book 15 years ago and found them. Did my research and got them. Been in love with them ever since."

Omarosa had appeared on GMA Thursday to offer her side of things in the White House hubbub, and after the camera cut away from Omarosa's interview, in which she said she had a story she'd ultimately tell of her White House days, the camera turned to Roberts, who noted, "She says she has a story to tell, and I'm sure she will be selling that story. Yeah. Bye, Felicia." The soon-to-be ex-White House staffer (if her January resignation date still stands) says Roberts was "petty" for her remarks. More on the Omarosa storm swirling online: "Bye, Felicia" was actually the "ultimate" way for Roberts to say her goodbyes to Omarosa, the New York Daily News notes. The paper rehashes the phrase's history and offers rapper Ice Cube's explainer on its essence, which is a way "to get anybody out of your face that's saying something stupid." It's originally from his 1995 comedy Friday.

The 33-year-old guitar teacher, his wife, their 3-day-old baby, and family members were gathered Tuesday night at the home in Panama City, Fla., when a bullet entered the home and struck Ayers in the back of the head, killing him. Police arrived and found neighbor Charles Edward Shisler, 62, in his backyard; he lives in a home directly behind the Ayers, the officer tells WJHG. Shisler, at first "extremely belligerent," ultimately admitted to the shooting but said it was an accident, the News Herald reports. "The damn gun doesn’t usually shoot," he said, according to the arrest report. "You have to squeeze the hell out of the trigger to shoot it." He said he picked up the loaded 9mm pistol by its trigger, and the gun discharged. The bullet traveled some 200 feet—through a window screen, a wooded area, the Ayers' sliding glass back door, and into their house. More than four hours after the shooting, a blood test found Shisler's BAC was 0.079, according to authorities; Florida's legal limit for driving is 0.08, the Raw Story notes. He has been charged with manslaughter as well as possession of a firearm by a convicted felon; he had a previous felony weapons conviction. "I had just gotten a picture of [Ayers] and the baby which was just born Father’s Day," a close friend of Ayers tells WMBB. "The look on his face was just priceless." (In October, another Florida man who killed himself accidentally hit his neighbor with the same bullet.)

Bill Haslam has a bill coming his way that has the Bible nominated as the official state book, a move critics say would be both "unconstitutional and sacrilegious," per Nashville Public Radio. The state Senate approved the holy tome 19-8 Monday night, which could make Tennessee the first state to adopt the Bible as its official book, the Tennessean reports. Advocates of HB 0615 insist it doesn't violate either federal or state constitutional mandates on the separation of church and state, mainly because they're basing their nomination not on the Bible's religious import, but on its historical, cultural, and even financial significance (NPR notes the state's multimillion-dollar Bible-printing industry). "This book has done more to bring us to where we are today than any other book in the history of mankind," argued Republican Sen. Kerry Roberts, who said he was initially conflicted about whether to vote for the bill (he did). What held him, and some others, back: the idea of the Bible being trivialized next to other state symbols—including a Barrett M82 sniper rifle and a state song about two guys looking for moonshine, per the AP. "I hear Satan snickering," Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris noted last year, adding it would "dumb the good book down," per the Times Free Press. The director of ACLU-Tennessee tells the Tennessean that "privileging one religion over another not only tramples on the Constitution, it marginalizes the tens of thousands of Tennesseans who choose to practice other religions or not to practice religion at all." Haslam has signaled his own reservations. "The Bible is the most important book in my life, and I think in the world," he told reporters last week, the AP notes. "But that's very different than being the state's official book." He has 10 days to sign the bill or veto it once he receives it; if he does neither, it automatically becomes law. (The Ten Commandments were removed from the Oklahoma capitol.)

The art world is buzzing over a French scientist's claims that he discovered a portrait of another woman lurking beneath the top layer of the world's most famous painting—meaning the Mona Lisa as we know her might not be the real her, the BBC reports. Pascal Cotte, who co-founded a Paris-based company that digitizes fine art, has been studying Da Vinci's signature piece for 10 years using a technology called the Layer Amplification Method, or LAM, which involves shining "intense" light onto a painting, then measuring the bounced-back reflections to gauge what's underneath, per Newsweek. And what Cotte says is underneath the surface of the Mona Lisa is an image of a woman looking off to the side (not straight ahead) with different physical characteristics than the model that currently smiles down on crowds at the Louvre. For instance, the hidden portrait shows a woman who boasts a bigger head, nose, and hands, as well as smaller lips, the Telegraph notes. Which means, as an art historian tells the paper, that "it was a portrait [that woman's] husband never received. Instead, Leonardo went on to paint the world's most famous picture over the top." But not everyone's convinced the find is that amazing. An Oxford University art history professor tells the BBC that the newly uncovered model was likely not the start of a completely different painting, but simply an "evolution" of the final Mona Lisa in which Da Vinci kept painting over the previous version until he got the result he wanted. "I am absolutely convinced that the Mona Lisa is Lisa," he says. The Louvre, for its part, is declining comment because it "was not part of the scientific team" that analyzed the painting, per the BBC. (The Telegraph floats a whole bunch of intriguing rumors about the painting.)

But no matter what happens, Suu Kyi can't be president: The junta-drafted constitution states that anyone whose child "owes allegiance to a foreign power" cannot ascend to the office, Newsweek reports, and Suu Kyi was married to a British national and has two kids who are British citizens. Suu Kyi has called the rule—which many think was written specifically to bar her from the office, the New York Times notes—"very silly" and has promised she'll be the true power behind the new president; after the election results are final, both houses of parliament and the military (unelected members of which will make up 25% of parliament no matter what, per constitutional guarantee) will each nominate a presidential candidate, and a vote will be held in early 2016. The two runners-up will be vice presidents, a position from which Suu Kyi is also barred. But she promised last week that if NLD wins the election, "I will be above the president," NPR reports. "I'll run the government and we'll have a president who will work in accordance with the policies of the NLD." Per the BBC's analysis, though, the constitution specifically prohibits that, and opponents might use the statement as a reason to challenge the election results.

Santorum was one of the foremost voices calling for Republicans to reject the treaty, and in the Daily Beast today he explains why, suggesting that, under the treaty, disabled children would have their fates decided by "a well-meaning but faceless and distant United Nations bureaucrat" rather than their parents. The US, he argued, "should be telling the UN, not the other way around, how to ensure dignity and respect for the disabled." Of course, proponents would say that's exactly what this was. The treaty was based on the Americans with Disabilities Act. The US "could have shown its leadership by ratifying the treaty," writes Michael Yudell of the Philadelphia Inquirer. Instead we got "nonsense" about the UN taking our sovereignty. "I’m curious whether these same Senators and other treaty opponents thought The X-Files was a documentary film." At the New York Times, Lawrence Downes calls it "a parting slap at Bob Dole," who arrived in a wheel chair and was greeted warmly by each Republican—before most voted against the treaty.

KZTV reports conjoined sisters Ximena and Scarlett Hernandez-Torres have been successfully separated in an operation their mother calls a "miracle." The sisters, who were connected below the waist and shared a colon and bladders, were born nearly 11 months ago. They've been living in the hospital since then as doctors prepared to separate them, according to Fox 7 Austin. The hours-long surgery Tuesday required nine surgeons, 10 nurses, and eight anesthesiologists. After separating the sisters, doctors set about reconstructing their colons and bladders. Scarlett and Ximena are expected to recover, and their mother, Silvia Torres, says they are already adapting to being separated. "Thank you all for your prayers," reads a message posted to the sisters' Facebook page following Tuesday's surgery. Ximena and Scarlett will require additional surgeries as they get older. The sisters are actually triplets; their third sister was born without complications. Conjoined siblings occur about once in every 200,000 births.

Yes, even Lindsay Lohan is apparently reminded of Lindsay Lohan when she reads about Bynes' troubles, as evidenced by this tweet from LiLo: "Why did I get put in jail and a nickelodeon star has had NO punishment(s) so far?" Shockingly, we have to agree with La Lohan on this one, although to be fair, Bynes has thus far avoided implication in any jewelry thefts. Lohan aired the sentiment shortly after news broke that Bynes—whose license is suspended—was pulled over yet again yesterday. Her car, at least, got impounded this time, E! reports. Prior to that, Bynes was photographed driving Thursday night with her face covered, which is probably about as safe as it sounds. But she insists she's fine and totally not crazy, TMZ reports. She also denies smoking pot while driving, and says the pipe she was pictured with in her car actually contained tobacco. Which sounds likely.

The agency says the Pavlof Volcano, which is about 600 miles southwest of Anchorage, erupted abruptly at 4:18pm local time. The agency says the eruption also led to tremors on the ground. The USGS has raised the volcano alert level to "Warning" and the aviation warning to "Red," the AP reports. The volcano, which is about 4.4 miles in diameter, has had 40 known eruptions and "is one of the most consistently active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc," the agency says. (A recent study found that while supervolcano eruptions are devastating, it might be possible to outrun them.)

Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton tells the Kansas City Star that his office served Ford, 38, with a protective order—given to Ford at the Excel Industries plant where he worked—that paints a dire picture of Ford's supposed mental state. "He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed," the complainant writes in all caps in the filing. "It's my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!" Walton wouldn't say who the complainant was, simply noting to KWCH that "I can't give you details, but it would be someone he was in a relationship with." The order was apparently placed in response to an incident that was said to have taken place between the complainant (who IDed herself as Ford's live-in girlfriend) and Ford on Feb. 5. In that complaint, the woman alleges she and Ford engaged in a verbal fight that soon turned violent and included Ford pushing and grabbing her and placing her in a "choke hold from behind" until she "couldn't breathe." She reported the alleged attack to police by phone on the 5th. Ford received the order at 3:30pm, and Walton said at a Friday press conference, per the New York Daily News, "He was upset but nothing greater than anybody else that gets served a [protection from abuse order]." Ford then left the factory; the first shots were reported at 4:57pm.

The state has threatened legal action if the ride-hailing company continues to pick up passengers without the correct permit, the AP reports. Uber says the cars are exempt from the permit requirement because they have a backup driver behind the wheel who must monitor the car's performance. State officials had a "positive conversation" Thursday with Uber about "how the company plans to comply with state regulations for self-driving vehicles," says a spokeswoman for California's State Transportation Agency. Video posted online Thursday showed a self-driving Uber run a red light on Wednesday, the same day the company launched the pilot program with several Volvo SUVs. Uber said in a written statement that the driver was suspended, and it attributed the infraction that took place in front of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art to "human error." That was an apparent reference to the company's policy that employees behind the wheel of the cars must constantly monitor them and be prepared to take over if the technology stops working or is about to do something dangerous or illegal. Far from playing defense, Uber offered the driver's failure as evidence of the need to continue pushing ahead a technology that proponents say will one day drive far more safely than humans.

"Now you come out ... from the 'Trump church' in the Republican primary with a big Trump halo," says Mike Murphy on NBC's Meet the Press. "But in the general election, Democrats all hate Trump and among Independents he's mostly upside-down. So what is your magic light sword in the primary becomes an anchor around your neck in the general." Murphy laments that such "all Trump all the time" candidates are commonplace: "It's like the Stalin trials now. If you wore the collectivist tie, you're out of order. It's the new reality of the Republican primary." For more around the dial: The lies: "This has never happened before," says ex-White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, a veteran of Bill Clinton's administration, on CNN's Reliable Sources, per the Hill. "We've had great presidents, we've had terrible presidents, Republicans and Democrats, but we've never had anything like this—where we have a president who is incapable of telling the truth." The narcissism: "Our message is rescue America—and we will rescue America—from the grasp of an unhinged narcissist who is creating ... chaos," says Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, on ABC's This Week, per USA Today.

The comedian drew outrage after a May stunt in which she was photographed wielding a bloody, decapitated fake head of President Trump, and she says a federal investigation has cleared her of posing a real threat to the 45th president. "The case is closed," Griffin tweeted Friday. USA Today reports that the Secret Service, which typically probes any possible presidential threats, did not confirm Griffin’s post. CNN fired Griffin as host of its New Year’s show over the photo, and she lost other comedy gigs, per USA Today. Vulture quips that with the controversy behind her, "Hopefully, Kathy Griffin will be able to move on to less violent, severed head-based critiques of the Trump administration."

Keith Davis, reported to be 41 or 42, was monitoring the Panama-registered Victoria No. 168, ensuring the crew was sticking to international fishing guidelines, when he disappeared Sept. 10 as the boat cruised about 500 miles off the Peruvian coast. Now the FBI and US Coast Guard are involved in the investigation, which has few details to offer so far. "He's just gone," the director of the Coast Guard's Investigative Service tells CNN. Crew members have said they noticed Davis, who had been on the boat about three weeks, was missing when they sought him out to approve a fish transfer. But his relatives are doubting this story, especially considering the experience of other such observers: CNN notes that they aren't fishermen's favorite people, mainly because they report violations to the authorities. That leads to observers being threatened and even assaulted—"every observer who has been doing it for very long has a story," an industry rep tells CNN—and one of Davis' family members tells WCVB that Davis had emailed his dad and said he was "uncomfortable" on the Victoria. Even more chilling: a video on a closed Facebook page dedicated to Davis that shows him singing about other observers who've gone missing at sea. A post by a relative notes that Davis' dad says his son's belongings were seized by the Panamanians and that US officials have not been allowed to interview a "person of interest," Raw Story reports. "It would be irresponsible of me to call this a 'coverup' of sorts however I am at a loss to call it otherwise," the post reads.

Craig Spencer "has been declared free of the virus," the city Department of Health said today in a statement. The doctor tested positive for the virus Oct. 23, just days after returning from treating patients in Guinea with Doctors Without Borders. The 33-year-old has been treated in a specially designed isolation unit at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital, a designated Ebola treatment center. His condition was upgraded from serious to stable last week and he was feeling well enough to request an exercise bike and a banjo. His fiancee and two friends were initially quarantined but were released and are being actively monitored along with hundreds of others. Spencer is expected to issue a statement but not take questions when he's released from the hospital. News of Spencer's infection set many New Yorkers on edge, particularly after details emerged that he rode the subway, dined in a meatball restaurant, and visited a bowling alley in the days before he tested positive. There are no known US Ebola cases left, NBC News reports; only two were infected in America, and the 21-day monitoring period for people who came in contact with Spencer will end Thursday.

"I think the Russians were in there, but it doesn't mean other people weren't, too," Woolsey tells CNN. "It's often not foolproof to say who it is because it is possible and sometimes easy to hide your tracks. There's lots of tricks." Woolsey, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations and was CIA director under Bill Clinton, admitted that Trump is an " expert in weaving around" issues like this, and there is a chance that he could just be playing the media with claims to "know things that other people don't know" about the hacking allegations. In other developments: Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, is among Trump staffers warning against "jumping to conclusions" on Russian hacking before a final report is released later this week, calling it "irresponsible." "There is zero evidence that they influenced the election," he told Fox News on Monday. Trump has promised to divulge what he knows about the hacking allegations on Tuesday or Wednesday, reports the New York Times, which notes that he has previously described suggestions Russia tried to sway the election as "ridiculous." Official sources tell CNN that the investigation ordered by the Obama administration has uncovered proof of Moscow's involvement including "digital fingerprints" from specific keyboards that have been traced to the Russian government. Sources tell CBS News that evidence of more attempted Russian cyberattacks has emerged in recent days, after the Obama administration revealed some of the tools used by alleged Russian hacking units. Reuters reports that John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has scheduled a hearing on cyberthreats for Thursday, just two days after the new Congress takes office.

Police finally got a break this week when the woman's sister called and turned her in. The boy was in Houston the whole time, and preparations are under way for a reunion. "I prayed every night that he was safe, loved, and he would come home one day," says Auboni Champion-Morin. Krystle Tanner has been charged with felony kidnapping. Syracuse: A girl abducted by her father in 2007 was found safe and sound in Bangkok, where she was living with him, reports the Post-Standard. Jeffery Shipman, 51, faces international parental kidnapping charges. Daughter Deonna, now 8, is back in the Syracuse area, and her mother is on her way back from Russia—she moved there to study nursing—to reunite with her.

"We are being cautious and careful, but in the context of a very bold effort." Some 600 top industrial plants' emissions will be regulated by the measure; if they can't cut their emissions as required, they'll have to secure pollution allowances from the state or other emitters who have an excess. By a vote of 9 to 1, California’s Air Resource Board approved some 3,000 pages of documentation, following a three-year process that saw testimony from industry execs and environmentalists. “We have led the nation in developing green policies," said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. "And we have seen our green economy grow as a result." See details of the cap-and-trade plan.

Cordaro was charged with grand larceny, criminal mischief, and DUI. In an equally strange case in South Dakota, authorities say Damon Andrews, 18, crashed a stolen car into a yard at 1:25am Sunday. He was charged with DUI—as was another driver who crashed into the ambulance sent to pick Andrews up, reports the Rapid City Journal.

Two days after House Republicans voted to release a memo regarding FBI surveillance and one day after President Trump was overheard saying he would release it, the FBI publicly came out opposing that plan. "We have grave concerns about the material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy," the FBI said in a statement Wednesday. The memo prepared by staffers for Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, concerns the role of the so-called Steele dossier in federal surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Last week, the Justice Department warned the House Intelligence Committee that releasing it would be "extraordinarily reckless." The intelligence community worries making the classified document public would inform foreign targets how to avoid surveillance. FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Chief of Staff John Kelly on Monday in an attempt to prevent the memo from being released. And Democrats say the memo picks and chooses information to cast doubt on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. Regardless, Kelly told Fox News Radio on Wednesday that the memo will be released "pretty quick."

The rapper was scheduled to appear at Columbia's Colonial Life Arena with a slew of other acts, including Cardi B and 2 Chainz, as part of the second annual Fall Ball, but he balked at following "standard safety procedures" at a checkpoint, the arena noted in a statement. Instead, he turned around and left, leaving the show to go on without him. "While we regret the artist's decision not to perform, Colonial Life Arena is not willing to bypass its security standards and jeopardize the safety of its patrons, performers, or staff members," the arena statement read. Refunds will start to be doled out Monday "at the point of purchase," the statement notes, per the State.

Keller and Collin Gwaltney went running in a mountainous area near Antonito on the afternoon of July 23, eventually taking different paths as they often did, Gwaltney tells Dateline NBC. "But after two hours passed and he didn't come home, we went out looking," he says, but to no avail. The Conejos County Sheriff's Office suspended its search earlier this month with no leads. Keller's mom, Zoe, says waiting for news about her 19-year-old son has been torturous. "It's just an awful situation not knowing if your loved one is in heaven or in a terrible situation on earth or out in the wilderness," she laments. Officials say the FBI is investigating the disappearance, and have not ruled out foul play. Back in Tennessee, the community is hoping for a miracle. "There have been a lot prayer vigils and fundraisers," Gwaltney says. "Everyone wants him home." A GoFundMe account has been created for the Keller family to help offset the cost of their search, investigation, and $50,000 reward for information leading to Keller's safe return. The teen is 5-foot-7, 160 lbs., with blond hair and hazel eyes. He was wearing red running shorts with reflective strips on the sides and blue running shoes at the time of his disappearance.

Obama’s speech, despite the customarily excessive use of 'I,' 'me,' and 'my,' was workmanlike and wise in its emphasis on continuity of strategy." Josh Marshall, Talking Points Memo: "If something like this went unchallenged Obama's status as the ultimate commander of the American military would pass a threshold level of credibility. And yet ... I'm not sure I thought he had it in him. But he did. I've learned something." Max Boot, Commentary: "If there is one general who can step quickly into the top job in Afghanistan, it is Petraeus. ... And if there is one general who knows how to handle the media and the political process (skills that McChrystal obviously lacked), it is Petraeus." Susan Davis, Wall Street Journal: "Obama may have made a smart tactical move that will shield his nominee from any pushback from congressional Republicans because they like Petraeus. They really, really like him."

He's taken a hiatus from shooting Two and a Half Men and will be in rehab for two weeks, reports TMZ. Sheen's wife, Brooke Mueller, also is in rehab, but she will reportedly be allowed to bring their twin boys to her facility, along with nannies. "Charlie is stressed. He's tired," a source tells People. "The kids are on his mind. Brooke's on his mind. A lot of things are on his mind. He didn't want to get a place where he had the urge to get high. He's not using and he doesn't want to. He felt like he needed to get away from negative influences around him and clear his head, rest and take a short break." Sheen still faces domestic violence charges after a Christmas Day incident.

Now it's texting and walking," a New Jersey bystander tells NBC New York after he watched a woman tumble head first into a gaping hole in the sidewalk on Thursday. The 67-year-old woman was staring at her phone while walking in Plainfield and failed to see a pair of access doors open in front of her. WPIX reports she fell six feet to where crews were working to repair gas lines. A surveillance camera captured the fall and, later, several firefighters carrying the woman out on a stretcher. She was hospitalized in serious condition. (A NJ lawmaker is trying to make texting and walking illegal.)

The 2-year-old male is the first gray wolf in the state since 1924, reports the Los Angeles Times. He crossed the border from Oregon Wednesday afternoon, according to biologists tracking his movements via GPS. This particular wolf, known as OR7, may head back to Oregon eventually, but it's likely just a matter of time now before a pack establishes itself in California. Ranchers won't be thrilled at the prospect of the return of a predator that got ran off decades ago, notes the San Jose Mercury News. "Whether one is for it or against it, the entry of this lone wolf into California is a historic event and result of much work by the wildlife agencies in the West," says a state fish and game official. "If the gray wolf does establish a population in California, there will be much more work to do here."

(As he explained to Leno, with the late night host "about to head out to pasture," the former president "just wanted to see what you looked like before you got to the gate.") Bush has famously taken up painting since leaving the White House; he told Leno the hobby "changed my life"—and then presented the host with a portrait he'd done of Leno. "I can't make fun of him now," Leno moaned.

A friend found the 26-year-old unconscious at his Florida home just after midnight on Tuesday, per McCarver's girlfriend, the WWE star Dana Brooke. She says she spoke to McCarver shortly before he died as he was about to make dinner. His last words to her were, "I love you. Goodbye." Law enforcement sources tell TMZ there were no signs of foul play. No cause of death was given. TMZ notes McCarver had worked out earlier on Monday with 160-pound dumbbells and appeared to be fine. Bodybuilding.com reports that McCarver's roommate and training partner, Josh Lenartowicz, found him facedown in the kitchen with food in his mouth. He failed to revive him and called paramedics. In March, McCarver collapsed on stage at the Arnold Classic, but he later appeared to be recovered in videos he posted, the New York Daily News reports. The 6-foot-1, 300-plus-pound weightlifter has been competing since he was 21. A rising star, he became the youngest pro in 2012 when he won the North American Championships, per Bodybuilding.com. Fans are posting tributes on McCarver's Facebook page.

That's what a Scottish tourist says led to his arrest in Dubai for touching a man's hip, the BBC reports. Jamie Harron, 27, says he was walking with a drink in the crowded Rock Bottom Cafe when he put out his hand "to avoid impact" with a patron, per the Press Association. The incident happened July 15 after the electrician stopped off in Dubai for a couple days en route to a job in Afghanistan. Police arrested Harron on charges of public indecency and drinking alcohol, casting the electrician in an "outrageous" saga that shows no signs of ending, says Radha Stirling of the Detained in Dubai NGO. "This is another example of how vulnerable tourists are to arrest and detention in Dubai," she says. Harron was locked up for five days and his passport was seized so he couldn't leave the country while the case is pending. Stirling says Harron "is under immense pressure and stress." He lost his job and has so far racked up more than $39,000 in legal bills and expenses for what he calls a "cultural misunderstanding," per the Sun. His parents say their son has never been in trouble before. "We can't believe that this nightmare has gone on for three months. Jamie is a good boy," says dad Graham Harron. The legal troubles have left the family finances in shambles, and mom Patricia Harron desperate with worry. "There's no chance of sleep," she says. Jamie Harron says he has witnesses ready to back up his version in court. (A woman was jailed in Dubai after reporting a rape.)

The mother, a gunner in the Royal Artillery, had no idea that she was pregnant before the baby arrived, healthy but five weeks premature, the Telegraph reports. A specialist team is on the way from Britain to bring the mother and baby home from the base, which had been attacked just days earlier by Taliban insurgents. Unaware she was pregnant, the soldier passed tough pre-deployment training, including an eight-mile run with a 25-pound backpack, before arriving in Afghanistan in March. "It is bizarre that she didn't feel some side effects of the pregnancy," an Army insider tells the Daily Mail. "But the conditions of deployment, the heat of the Afghan summer, the different hours of working, mean that many soldiers feel a little odd and put it down to the change of environment." The British military does not allow pregnant women to deploy and has sent at least 70 pregnant soldiers home from Afghanistan over the last 10 years.

He was 88 and had been the world's longest reigning monarch, reports the AP. The Royal Palace said Bhumibol died "in a peaceful state" at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, where he underwent an operation over the weekend and had been treated over the past decade. During a reign that spanned 70 years, the US-born Bhumibol was the nation's one constant as myriad governments rose and fell, a gentle leader who used the throne's influence to unify the nation and rally troops through the Cold War as Thailand's neighbors fell under communist control. In his heyday, the frail, soft-spoken man in spectacles wielded so much power and respect, he could squelch coups and rebellions with a gesture or a few well-chosen words. Bhumibol was the world's richest monarch and one of the planet's wealthiest people: Forbes magazine estimated his fortune at more than $30 billion in 2011. Although not known for having extravagant tastes, he nevertheless lived the elite life of a modern-day king, racing yachts and appearing at official functions clothed in ornate golden robes. Over the last decade, the once vigorous Bhumibol had withdrawn from public life due to a series of illnesses. His wife, Queen Sirikit, has also long been ailing and has been even more rarely seen. Strong anti-defamation laws in Thailand make it a severe crime to speak ill of the king or the royal family, making it sometimes difficult for outsiders to gauge public opinion. However, NPR reports that the king's successor, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, is clearly less well-liked than his father. Thailand's PM says the government will observe a one-year mourning period and flags will fly at half-staff for 30 days. No government events will be held for 30 days, he added. The world's longest reigning monarch is now Queen Elizabeth II, who ascended to the British throne in 1952.

On the heels of the former VP candidate calling for President Obama's impeachment, 54% of voters say they've heard too much from Palin already and would prefer that she be less outspoken in political debates, according to an NBC News poll. While that balanced out to two-thirds of Democrats, it also included a majority of independents and 40% of Republicans. But Palin shouldn't feel terribly singled out; the poll found that voters would like these guys to shut up, too: Jesse Jackson, 51% Dick Cheney, 45% Newt Gingrich, 43% Al Gore, 40% Bill Clinton, 32% Palin's impeachment zinger has thus far found little support among the GOP, which may also fear it could drive Democrats to the polls in November. John Boehner said yesterday "I disagree" with those calling for Obama's impeachment, the Hill reports. And "while Mr. Obama's abuses of executive power are serious," they don't reach the level of impeachment, a Wall Street Journal op-ed notes. In fact, impeachment "at the current moment would backfire on Republicans" as it plays into the claim from Democrats "that GOP opposition to Mr. Obama is personal."

Constable Jarrod Singh of Toronto's Durham Regional Police Service was called to the scene of a fight Sunday night, CBC reports. He arrived to find eight people surrounding another person. Singh says he can see how someone mistook it for a fight; but the person in the center of the crowd was actually break dancing. It turns out the group were members of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology's dance troupe and were filming a music video. The dancers thought they were about to be shut down when Singh showed up. Instead, after talking with the group for a bit, Singh says he "decided it was time to bust a move," the Global News reports. The results, according to the Ottawa Citizen, were "amazing." The Facebook video of Singh breaking it down with one of the dancers has been shared more than 800,000 times. This wasn't the constable's first rodeo; before joining the police, he was a member of his college's dance troupe, which once opened for rapper Rick Ross.

Gliedman, 27, and boyfriend Aaron Greene, 31, were found with bomb-making materials and papers labeled "The Terrorist Encyclopedia" in their apartment, after police were tipped off by a couple who the duo let use their shower. But sources tell the Daily Beast the two are just "well-to-do junkies, not terrorists." And both have troubled pasts, the New York Post reports. In February, Gliedman, the daughter of a top New York oncologist, met a man at a Manhattan bar and allegedly stole his laptop, cell phone, and wallet after going back to his place. She hasn't yet been charged in that case, but just five days later, she and Greene—who attended Harvard—were nabbed in a heroin bust with a gun on them. Greene was sentenced to five months in jail, while Gliedman was still on probation. It was due to end next week, but the case could now be re-opened in light of the new charges.

"A truck carrying what first seemed to be normal cans of the soft drink Pepsi was stopped, and after the standard process of searching the products, it became clear that the alcoholic beers were covered with Pepsi's sticker logos," a border official said. A tweet on the Saudi customs agency's page shows some photos of the busted brews. The Washington Post reports this isn't the first desperate attempt in Saudi Arabia to bring in some booze, noting a recent incident of a man who sewed 12 bottles of hooch into his pants. (An elderly UK man had faced 360 lashes for possessing homemade wine in Saudi Arabia—but he was recently released.)

Cuba's Foreign Ministry says the country's UN delegation has "voiced a strong protest" against Trump's "disrespectful, unacceptable, and meddling statements," Reuters reports. In his address, Trump slammed the Cuban regime as "corrupt" and "destabilizing" and said there was no chance of the US trade embargo being lifted until Havana brings in "fundamental reforms." Other reactions: "Trump's ignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times-not the 21st Century UN," tweeted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. "Fake empathy for Iranians fools no one." Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who was not present for the speech, called Trump "the new Hitler," the Independent reports. Earlier, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza responded to Trump's call for democracy to be restored in the country by saying: "No leader can come and question our democracy, can come and question our sovereignty." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave the speech a better review. "In over 30 years in my experience with the UN, I never heard a bolder or more courageous speech," he said. Trump, who warned that the US would "totally destroy" North Korea if necessary, was also applauded by South Korea, the AP reports. Trump set out a "firm and specific stance regarding the important issue of maintaining peace and security now facing the international community and the United Nations," said a spokesman for the country's presidential office. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom tells the BBC: "It was the wrong speech, at the wrong time, to the wrong audience." "This was a bombastic, nationalist speech," she says. "It must have been decades since one last heard a speech like that in the UN General Assembly." Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev said Trump painted Syria, Cuba, and Venezuela as "almost the worst dictatorships in the history of the humankind." He said that in the "contradictory" speech, Trump expressed support for nations' sovereign rights but mixed it with a "barefaced US pretense to determine who has such rights and who does not," the AP reports. (One US commentator believes Trump's speech bordered "on the threat of committing a war crime.")

The Washington Post calls the move “apparently unprecedented.” President Obama’s top lawyer had sought a deal and White House officials had delivered some 20,000 more pages of emails and other documents to investigators yesterday, while Democrats on the panel fought the decision; the vote nonetheless came down 14-9 along party lines. The communications requested involve Bill Daley and Joe Biden’s chief of staff Bruce Reed, as well as a broad selection of other senior aides including Rahm Emanuel, Valerie Jarrett, Larry Summers, and former Biden chief of staff Ron Klain. Rep. Cliff Stearns says he also wants to see the president’s relevant BlackBerry messages, Politico reports. The panel’s ranking Democrat called the move a partisan attack and “sad day” for the committee.

On the Republican side, Cruz scored an easy victory over Donald Trump and John Kasich, reports CNN. With 97% or results in, Cruz has 48%, Trump 35%, and Kasich 14%. On the Democratic side, Sanders comfortably defeated Hillary Clinton 56% to 43%. Wisconsin has 42 delegates at stake for Republicans, and even though it's not winner-take-all, the Cruz victory will be a boost in his quest to keep Trump from securing the necessary number of delegates ahead of the GOP convention. "Tonight is a turning point," Cruz told supporters after the race was called. "It is a rallying cry." He's winning, he added, because his campaign is uniting the Republican party. Sanders, meanwhile, can now boast of winning seven of the last eight contests, with delegate-rich New York up for grabs on April 19, reports Politico. In his own speech to supporters, Sanders emphasized the "momentum" of his campaign. "Real change never, ever takes place from the top on down," he said. "It always takes place from the bottom on up." For Democrats, 86 delegates were at stake on Tuesday. The AP reports that turnout was projected to be about 40% of eligible voters, the highest in a presidential primary in the state since 1980.

If not, it seems inevitable that will happen soon, given his viral videos and headlines referring to the "Jordan Peterson Moment" and the "Jordan Peterson Phenomenon." Peterson is a 55-year-old psychologist at the University of Toronto whose latest book, 12 Rules for Life, has become an international best-seller. In fact, Peterson has managed to become "one of the most influential—and polarizing—public intellectuals in the English-speaking world," writes Kelefa Sanneh in the New Yorker. Some basics about him: A theme, and critique: Peterson "delivers stern fatherly lectures to young men on how to be honorable, upright, and self-disciplined—how to grow up and take responsibility for their own lives," writes David Brooks in the New York Times. The message has found an audience, though Brooks says it "sounds to me like vague exhortatory banality." Peterson's "recipe for self-improvement is solitary, nonrelational, unemotional," and Brooks thinks "the lives of young men can be improved more through loving attachment than through Peterson's joyless and graceless calls to self-sacrifice." The interview: Virtually every story about Peterson refers to this interview of him by Cathy Newman of Channel 4 News in Britain earlier this year. In it, he defends his view that men need to "grow the hell up," and the gist of much commentary is that Peterson came up against a hostile interviewer and won convincingly. At the Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf has a detailed critique, faulting Newman for trying to "put words into the academic's mouth."

"Magical things are happening all around her—ornate sets, clever video displays, fiery dancing—but Ms. Spears is there mostly to activate memories, to be a souvenir for the eyes. Rarely did the voice booming out over the speakers appear to be coming directly from Ms. Spears’s mouth. Always a notch or three less committed than her backup dancers, she was at times downright listless." But everything about the production other than Britney herself "is splashy and top volume," including the "vibrant" costumes, "powerful" choreography, and "imposing" set design. The show was certainly cheesy, writes Sophie Schillaci at MTV, and "if you're looking for a powerhouse vocal performance in your Vegas entertainment," you'd be better served by Celine Dion. "But Britney fans will find no better show on the strip than Piece of Me," a "larger-than-life production" that will get the audience on its feet, and is more a nostalgic "greatest hits marathon" than a look forward. On Celebuzz, Jason Marshall offers up the pros and cons of the show. Among the highlights: Britney can still dance (in sneakers); her hair and costumes (there are "at least seven costume changes," including three wigs and a pair of huge angel wings) are fantastic; the 24-song set list is "amazing" and will have you singing along; the set is "awesome"; and the merch is "pretty incredible." Among the lowlights: Only the expensive seats include a close-up view of Britney (the huge screens don't actually show what's happening onstage); most of the songs have been shortened; Spears barely addresses the audience or gets personal; and oh yeah, she doesn't "appear to be singing throughout a lot of the show," though the pre-recorded remixes are still "all sorts of awesome." Similarly, Rolling Stone rounds up the "5 best and 5 saddest" moments from the show. Caryn Ganz concludes, "Viewed through a lens of diminished expectations ... Britney: Piece of Me is an entertaining tour through the 32-year-old star's nearly 15-year recording career" and features "flashes of greatness" ... as well as a few "true bummers." Time offers up some of the best videos from the event. "Who cares if Britney doesn’t actually sing during her show?" writes Courtney Subramanian. "What she gives in pumped-up dance moves and dazzling costume changes is a huge leap forward from her disastrous going-through-the-motions 2007 VMA performance."

The 86-year-old former leader, who is often rumored to be dead or seriously ill, chatted with reporters and other voters in his first extended public outing since 2010, Reuters reports. Castro was stooped and spoke in a weak voice about issues including Hugo Chavez and his brother Raul's economic reforms. "The people are truly revolutionary, they have really sacrificed," Castro said, praising public participation in the elections. "We don't have to prove it, history will. Fifty years of the blockade and they haven't given in." Only Communist Party-selected candidates were on the ballot in the Cuban elections, which will send 612 delegates to the National Assembly, the BBC reports.

Demonstrators are climbing the tallest building in western Europe, London's 87-story Shard, to make their point. Safety personnel and police are watching after the team of six women began ascending the building via the roof of a nearby subway station. They're reportedly "free-climbing" the building; part of its exterior is built like a ladder, the BBC reports. The Shard is between the three headquarters of Shell, Greenpeace says, and it resembles a piece of ice. At the top, says a climber, "we'll try to hang a huge art installation ... that will make Shell think twice before sending their rigs into the Arctic." The climbers, who have been live-streaming the event via head-mounted cameras, are all highly trained, says a rep. Monitoring police say they got a call about the protest at 4:20 this morning, the Guardian reports.

His uncontained tat (see a pic here) of a phoenix ascending out of the ashes has spurred exes Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez ("it's awful!") to dish on the matter, lots of Twitter buzz (and a parody handle), and even a New Yorker analysis. And Affleck himself finally addressed the issue, after apparently reading the latter piece. "@NewYorker I'm doing just fine," he tweeted Thursday. "Thick skin bolstered by garish tattoos." If you think he's being too hard on himself with the word "garish," take heart: It's likely sarcasm, as the New Yorker used that exact descriptor in its article. Or post-divorce Ben Affleck just has a decent sense of self-effacing humor.

Lumberyard's beta version dropped Tuesday, and the company frames its purpose like so: "Whether you are a major studio, an indie developer, a student, or a hobbyist, Lumberyard provides a growing set of tools to create the highest-quality games" and intersects with Amazon's cloud services (aka AWS) and its streaming video-game platform, Twitch. Scroll down past the legalese to Section 57.10 of the AWS ToS, updated Monday to cover Lumberyard, and you'll first see a standard-looking warning. The "Acceptable Use" language instructs users that Lumberyard isn't to be used with "life-critical or safety-critical systems" such as operating medical equipment or driverless cars. But there's an exception to that clause, and it gives users a pass if there are zombies afoot—a playful move that VentureBeat notes could "actually be good for business." "This restriction will not apply in the event of the occurrence (certified by the United States Centers for Disease Control or successor body) of a widespread viral infection transmitted via bites or contact with bodily fluids that causes human corpses to reanimate and seek to consume living human flesh, blood, brain or nerve tissue and is likely to result in the fall of organized civilization."

The famous Italian tower is doing just fine more than 800 years after it first started tilting during construction, according to a group that's been monitoring the 190-foot Tuscan monument since 2001. It's in better condition now than predicted by an international committee of researchers, reports ANSA. Indeed, the tower has lost 1.5 inches of its tilt over the past two decades—it was closed in 1990 because its tilt became too considerable, per Popular Science—with "oscillations now varying at the average of 1/2 millimeter a year," says Nunziante Squeglia, a professor of geotechnics at the University of Pisa. "What counts the most is the stability of the bell tower, which is better than expected," adds Squeglia, who credits work to stabilize the structure on soft soil. A study published in May actually pointed out the importance of that soil in keeping Pisa's landmark upright. Essentially, the soft soil modifies ground vibrations—not uncommon in Italy, which sits on multiple fault lines—to prevent much motion in the tower, which has emerged undamaged from at least four strong earthquakes since 1280. "Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events," an engineer says in a release. (Still, you may be underwhelmed.)

When Herman Cain was asked about his earlier comments that he wouldn’t allow a Muslim in his administration, or that they should take an extra loyalty oath, Gingrich jumped in with an anecdote about the Times Square bomber, Think Progress notes. Asked why he’d violated his oath to the US, the bomber, in Newt’s telling, replied, “You’re my enemy. I lied.” “If you’re not prepared to be loyal to the United States, you will not serve in my administration, period,” Newt continued. “We did this in dealing with the Nazis and we did this in dealing with the communists.” Muslim groups were outraged, and political analysts were perplexed. “Either he is doing this for political purposes to distract people from a campaign in disarray, which is bad, or he actually believes it, which is scary,” ex-Bush strategist Matthew Dowd tells ABC.

TJ Oshie rode the subway to the DC arena for Game 4 with fellow player Matt Niskanen, just as they did for Game 3. But Oshie's card came up 35 cents short as he was exiting the station, reports Fox5 DC. As he stood in line to add money, a Metro employee let him through. "I don't know how much that ride was, but I owe you big time," Oshie said later, per USA Today. A few hours after his subway ride, Oshie scored the first goal of the game and later added two assists in Washington's 6-2 win. The Caps now lead the best-of-seven series 3-1, with Game 5 on Thursday night in Vegas. One fan posted a photo of Oshie and Niskanen on the subway. (Oshie previously drew national attention for this Olympic performance.)

They thought the marks might be animal prints, but on closer inspection discovered something much cooler: nearly million-year-old human footprints—the oldest ones ever found outside of Africa and the earliest evidence of life in northern Europe, reports the Guardian. Scientists think the tracks were made by up to five people, likely a mix of adults and children, somewhere between 800,000 and 900,000 years ago. They are "one of the most important discoveries, if not the most important discovery that has been made on (Britain's) shores," one archaeologist tells the BBC. "It will rewrite our understanding of the early human occupation of Britain and indeed of Europe." The tracks were preserved in the silt and mud of an estuary all this time before being exposed on a stretch of fast-eroding coastline, reports AP. They have since been washed away. As for those ancient travelers—maybe a single family?—they were walking along a river in a valley that might have been teeming with mammoths, hippos, and rhinos.

Mullah Abdul Rauf was killed yesterday in Helmand province in a strike that tribal elders say hit a car traveling across the desert and killed around six people, the BBC reports. Rauf—who was captured by US forces in 2001 and spent six years in Guantanamo Bay before escaping from house arrest in Kabul—is believed to have become a recruiter for ISIS after falling out with Taliban leaders last month, according to the BBC, which notes that this was one of the first strikes under NATO's new mandate in Afghanistan. Even before Rauf changed sides, there were reports of groups of Afghan fighters trading the Taliban's white flag for the black one of ISIS, though it's not clear how big a foothold the group has gained in the country. "In the context of an insurgency that kills thousands of Afghan national security forces every year, scattered reports about a few people in the mountains wearing black is not an immediate concern," an analyst in Afghanistan with International Crisis Group tells the Guardian, though he adds that rumors of leader Mullah Omar's death have deepened rifts within the Taliban—and there are suspicions about whether the group gave away Rauf's location to NATO.

And thanks to her adoptive mom's efforts, the Sith lord was there Friday in a Wilmington, Del., courtroom, as were a slew of Stormtroopers, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and even a family court judge dressed up like Princess Leia as the Star Wars theme song played, People reports. "I wanted this day to be everything she ever wanted," new mom Deanna Pedicone tells WPVI. "It's only once in a lifetime that she'll be adopted." The News Journal details the mother and daughter's path to becoming a family, starting when the unmarried Pedicone started out as a foster parent a few years ago. Just two weeks after getting licensed in November 2013, a nearly 2-year-old Zoe was placed with her. Their bond grew so great that Pedicone decided to pursue adoption, and her application was approved a few months ago. She says she was inspired to make her daughter's Star Wars-themed dream come true by a video of another little girl's adoption that featured a bevy of princesses. Pedicone recruited a local Star Wars costuming group and filled Judge Barbara Crowell in on her plans, and Crowell was happy to oblige, even dressing up as Leia Organa and touching Zoe's head with a lightsaber as she announced her official name change. Now Pedicone says she and Zoe can concentrate on their future together, something they were never fully able to do when Zoe was her foster child. "There are no more strings. … No more case workers. No more attorneys. It is just us," she says. (Carrie Fisher finished filming the next Star Wars movie before her death this week.)

The addition comes on the heels of Theron's split from Sean Penn, who Us notes had wanted to adopt Jackson. Meanwhile, the new mama is already being embarrassing.

A senior diplomat said fighters were trying to coax Gbagbo out of the bunker he's been hiding in. The diplomat also revealed that Gbagbo's closest adviser and longtime friend had abandoned him, leaving the bunker to seek refuge inside the French ambassador's home, reports the AP. The BBC reports that Gbagbo's rep told the AFP he is not yet ready to surrender. But the AP reports that Ouattara's ambassador to France said Gbagbo is negotiating exactly that, though he did not provide any details. "I'm not trying to be demagogical or to add to the disinformation, but according to the information that I have, he's negotiating his surrender because he has realized the end is near. The game is up," he said.

During an interview on the Tavis Smiley show on PBS last week, Cumberbatch was asked about diversity in acting roles and said, "I think as far as colored actors go it gets really different in the UK, and a lot of my friends have had more opportunities here [in the US] than in the UK, and that's something that needs to change. Something's gone wrong. We're not representative enough in our culture of different races, and that really does need to step up apace." Of course, Cumberbatch was quickly called out for using the term "colored." Yesterday, he apologized, telling People he feels like a "complete fool." "I'm devastated to have caused offense by using this outmoded terminology," he said in a statement. "I offer my sincere apologies. I make no excuse for my being an idiot and know the damage is done. I can only hope this incident will highlight the need for correct usage of terminology that is accurate and inoffensive. The most shaming aspect of this for me is that I was talking about racial inequality in the performing arts in the UK and the need for rapid improvements in our industry when I used the term. ... While I am sorry to have offended people and to learn from my mistakes in such a public manner please be assured I have. I apologize again to anyone who I offended for this thoughtless use of inappropriate language about an issue which affects friends of mine and which I care about deeply."

"It was just so overwhelming for me, everything, just the performance—I missed some cues so I was a little disappointed at that—and just everyone, just the support," the 21-year-old said, per People. "Honestly, I just wasn't expecting them to support me in the way they did," he added. "Last time I was at an award show I was booed." Bieber also touched on his past troubles. "I had a bunch of knuckleheads around me, that was pretty much it," he said. "You have to test the waters. I just happened to be in the spotlight, in front of cameras all the time, and they caught all those moments." Bieber then pointed at the crowd, asking, "You didn't have those moments?" Jimmy Fallon's response: "Not as much as you did." The Biebs' new album drops Nov. 13. His first single, "What Do You Mean," has already hit the top of the charts in 89 countries, Fallon said.

You're obligated to reply to any petition that gets enough signatures on the "We the People" site—even the one to deport Piers Morgan over his gun-control stance. What do you do? Well, you could issue a statement that never uses the words "Piers," "Morgan," or "deport," which is what the White House has done, New York reports. Instead, Jay Carney tactfully addresses the principle at hand, in a post titled, "When Discussing the Second Amendment, Keep the First in Mind Too." President Obama, he assures us, believes in the right to bear arms, but he also believes in freedom of speech. "No one should be punished by the government simply because he or she expressed a view on the Second Amendment—or any other matter of public concern."

In an earnings call yesterday, the company shared a lower-than-expected forecast for the quarter ending in December, but it also shared this tidbit: Members of its loyalty program will be able to use a planned mobile ordering and payment app to request delivery in select cities in late 2015, the Wall Street Journal reports. "Our version of e-commerce on steroids" will give "the ability to create a standing order of Starbucks delivered hot to your desk daily," Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said during the call. The app, which allows customers to order a drink for pickup and pay with their phones, will debut in Portland, Ore., next month, with the delivery feature coming later, NBC News reports.

But when it came time to pay, they found two extra line items on their $115 bill: "Im a plad [sic] a--hole" and "I have a small penis." One of the diners tells the Washington Post that the insults apparently stemmed from an "awkward" moment earlier when his companion questioned a server about why their rice wasn't served in individual bowls, at one point saying, "That's the way it's done in China." Later, when the foursome asked to split the check, the server sarcastically replied, "That's totally how they do it in China," the diner says. "Then we saw the receipt." The group called over a manager, who said the comments on the bill were a joke among the servers, and handed over a $20 gift card. "They didn't do too much to apologize," the diner adds, per ARL Now. Peter Chang himself went several steps further. In a statement, he says the manager, server, and another server who entered the insults into the computer have been fired. His daughter, general manager Lydia Zhang, will also be fired once an investigation wraps up. "I am deeply disturbed by the incident. I am sorry, my respected guests," he says. "Business is business," Chang's business partner, Gen Lee, tells the Post of the family head-rolling, adding he'll now manage the restaurant personally. Insulting guests via the bill is practically a "trend" at this point, notes a post at Eater, which rounds up other instances involving racial slurs and jokes about a patron's weight. (A father's restaurant receipt included a slight on his kids.)

Instead, he delivered “what was likely the most horrifically devastating keynote presentation in SXSW history,” Alissa Walker writes at Fast Company. Loads of audience members left halfway through, then furiously tweeted their displeasure. Many blamed buzzword-happy interviewer Umair Haque, who talked about his vacation, blog, and “generally himself.” But some of the blame has to fall on Williams. The CEO unveiled @Anywhere, a new feature that will allow sites to easily integrate Twitter content. “It’s a slick feature,” writes Nicholas Ciarelli of the Daily Beast, but “audience members were justified in being unimpressed. … One now gets the sense that Twitter is focusing too much on being awesome, instead of addressing the more difficult questions about the future of its business.

A gold hearse took Houston's body from the airport to a funeral home in her hometown of Newark, reports the BBC. Her family hopes to use the city's 18,000-capacity Prudential Center for a wake on Thursday, and a funeral on Friday, sources tell the New York Times. The viewing of the body is expected to last all day Thursday, but a New Jersey Devils game scheduled for Friday night may pose a logistical challenge to funeral arrangements, the source says. Houston's family is also considering holding a smaller ceremony at the New Hope Baptist Church, where the singer started her career in the choir. Mourners have left flowers and candles for Houston at the fence around the church, reports AP.

In fact, that news is being tempered with a headline-making baby who decided to arrive early—while her mother was huddled in a shelter amid 170-mile winds, notes the Sun. Luckily for mom Akiko Pruss, one of her fellow shelter-seekers happened to a midwife visiting from Britain. "It was a perfect natural delivery," says the Good Samaritan, Carol Weeks.

Their class-action lawsuit attacking the company for luring clueless children with "addictive," expensive game apps was recently given the go-ahead by a San Jose judge. Games are "highly addictive, designed deliberately to be so, and tend to compel children playing them to purchase large quantities of game currency, amounting to as much as $100 per purchase or more," according to court documents. The apps can often be downloaded for free, but kids can rack up big bills purchasing extra levels and items. "Smurfberries," for example, which serve as currency in the Smurfs game, sell in batches costing up to $59, notes MSNBC. Children are usually not required to provide credit card information, and the costs are automatically billed to parents' iTunes accounts. Apple was recently forced to change security settings on iPhones to block such charges. In one case, a 7-year-old British boy racked up a $2,000 bill on an iPad buying animals for the Tap Zoo game, reports the Daily Mail. Parents say that it's all part of a devious plan, while Apple has argued that it's easy for parents to block their children from making such charges.

An estimated 65-70 tanks were grabbed from outside cages in three separate heists, two at Lee's Summit on the same day in November (from a gas station and a CVS) and one this month in Independence (another CVS location). Meanwhile, handfuls of phones were purchased at Walmarts in four Missouri cities in recent days, ABC 17 News reports. At least a hundred were purchased at two Walmarts around the weekend; in one incident, dozens of phones were bought by several men late Friday night. The FBI is investigating at least three of the purchases. "Right then and there I knew there was not something adding up about this," says a witness. "It's not right, it doesn't make any sense. Who's going to order 50 phones for Christmas? Who does that?" Paul Fennewald, former security coordinator for Missouri Homeland Security, says prepaid phones have been used by criminals to communicate unnoticed by law enforcement, and by terrorists to trigger bombs. But retired FBI agent Michael Tabman tells a different story: "This is probably not part of terrorist planning for a number of reasons," he tells Fox4 KC. "One is they wouldn't steal these items because they know that would attract law enforcement's attention. Also this would not be a tool of choice."

That's according to a Oct. 17 report by the Department of the Interior's inspector general, which found the unnamed employee used a government-issued computer to visit some 9,000 adult video sites, including many associated with Russian websites containing malware. That malware, linked to ransomware attacks and designed to steal data from infected devices, infiltrated the USGS network at the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center in South Dakota, reports TechCrunch. Nextgov reports the employee no longer works at the agency. Their "extensive history of visiting adult pornography websites" clashed with rules prohibiting the use of government networks to view pornography, agreed upon "several years prior to detection," the report notes. The employee also broke rules against connecting unauthorized devices to the computer. Videos were saved to a USB drive, and a personal Android cellphone also infected with malware, per the BBC. TechCrunch reports there were no threats to national security as the EROS Center, a satellite imaging facility monitoring land surface, doesn't operate classified networks. Still, auditors recommend USGS enforce blacklists of banned websites and do more to stop employees from connecting personal devices to government computers. (Ted Cruz once "liked" a porn clip, but then he called it a mistake.)

Another customer, Jessie Grady, caught part of the incident on her phone, showing the white customer berating two black employees for what she says was an attempt to strong-arm her into buying a reusable shopping bag and for discriminating against her. She also claims one of the employees accused her under her breath of voting for Donald Trump (a claim the employee can be heard denying in the video). "And I voted for Trump, so there," the customer yells in the video. "What? You want to kick me out because of that? And look who won." She also calls the employee a "liar" and another one "an animal," and her diatribe also covered Grady and her family. Grady was so incensed at what she says was this "unprovoked attack" that she created a GoFundMe page for the worker who took the brunt of the customer's wrath (nearly $30,000 has been raised so far). "I'd like to show her that many people are horrified by how this woman treated her," Grady writes. In a statement, Michaels said it doesn't "tolerate discrimination or racism of any kind" and was "grateful for the leadership of our store team." In a Monday tweet, it also expressed thanks for the "outpouring of support for our Chicago-based team member." The customer in the video left before cops arrived.

The 8,700-mile flight, set to begin in October, will take the full 18 hours heading west and 15 hours heading back to the States, making it the longest nonstop flight to or from the US. United already holds the current record for a US carrier—a 8,446-mile flight to Singapore out of San Francisco, per a press release—while Aussie airline Qantas tops that with a 8,576-mile route from Sydney to Dallas, per USA Today. (Qatar Airlines currently flies the world's longest route: 9,032 miles from New Zealand to Qatar.) The new United flight, which needs final approval by regulators, would also set a record for the longest regularly scheduled route on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Because of the drastic time difference created when crossing over the international date line in between the two countries, commuters heading toward Singapore will arrive there on paper two days later, while those heading east toward the US will actually feel like time-travelers: They'll take off from Singapore at 11am and "go back in time" to touch down in LA at 10:15am the same day. (United is probably better off sticking to the flight business instead of tweeting about chicken nuggets.)

A lawyer for the Death Row records founder tells the AP Knight accidentally ran over and killed a friend yesterday afternoon while trying to "escape" in his pickup truck after being attacked by two other men. But police give a different account of events to the LA Times, saying that after Knight argued with two men on the set of NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton, he followed them to Tam's Burgers around 3:30pm PST and ran them over. "Looks like he drove backwards and struck the victims and drove forwards and struck them again," a police spokesman says. "The people we talked to say it looked like it was an intentional act." CNN reports the man killed was Terry Carter, 55; TMZ describes him as an actor. The second victim has been named as Cle Sloan, 51, who TMZ reports appeared in Training Day. Police say the incident is being investigated as a homicide, not a traffic accident; Knight's bail has been set at $2 million. Knight—who was behind the wheel when passenger Tupac Shakur was shot dead in 1996—has a long history of legal problems, including an alleged camera theft for which he is on bail. His lawyer says he is confident that Knight, whose pickup was found abandoned in a parking lot hours after the incident, "will be totally exonerated." The Times notes it's not clear whether Knight had any "affiliation with the production" of the biopic.

"Our work is finished, and the beast finally defeated after a mammoth effort from the team," says Alex Saunders of the Thames Water utility, per Sky News. The congealed blob made of fat, oil, wet wipes, feminine hygiene products, and even condoms had taken over a sewer in the eastern part of the city, wreaking havoc on the sewer itself as it ballooned. It took what Saunders calls the "gut-wrenching work" of eight people with powerful jet hoses to blast the "rock-hard" fatberg out of existence (the remnants were vacuumed up and transported away). "Nailing this fatberg was like battling a giant Harry Potter movie creature beneath the streets of London," the head of a partner wastewater utility tells Get West London. Thames Water is running a "Bin it, don't block it" campaign to get people to quit flushing anything and everything down the toilet, the Evening Standard reports. The utility estimates it spends $1.3 million a month unclogging blockages throughout its sewer network, which runs close to 70,000 miles. The fatberg is gone but won't be forgotten: The remains of the gross glob will be turned into enough biodiesel to fuel one Routemaster double-decker bus for a year. And the Museum of London, which had previously expressed interest in acquiring part of the fatberg, put in a bid for it last month, with the museum's director noting it could become "one of the most extraordinary objects" in any London museum. (Here's how Baltimore dealt with its fatberg.)

Hodel—who has long claimed his physician father killed 22-year-old Elizabeth Short, also known as the "Black Dahlia," along with several others—says George Hodel may have been trying to imitate the surrealist work of famous artist Man Ray, who was a family friend. As the Guardian puts it, "Two of Man Ray's photographs, Les Amoureux and Minotaur, do bear a chilling resemblance to Short's mutilated body." He may have wanted to create a "masterpiece, a crime so shocking and horrible it would endure, be immortalized through the annals of crime lore," says Steve. Short's body, found in a vacant lot in Los Angeles in 1947, was sliced in two in what is known as a hemicorporectomy, taught while George Hodel was in medical school (the Guardian details other gruesome details of the crime). George died in 1999 and was never charged with the crime, but police records show he was a suspect, and Steve details other potential clues he has uncovered: A handwriting expert found that letters the killer sent to police bore a resemblance to his dad's scrawl. Receipts also showed George Hodel bought bags of concrete just before Short's murder; bags of the same size and brand were found near Short's body. While police seem largely uninterested in Steve's evidence, "my judge and jury are the public," says Steve. (Click for more unsolved Hollywood murders.)

Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez has told Florida officials that the state's attempt to purge people it believes are noncitizens from the rolls needs to be cleared by the department to ensure it does not "endanger the ability of eligible US citizens to register to vote and maintain their voter registration," Talking Points Memo reports. Civil rights groups say Florida is using an inaccurate database that is removing eligible voters from the rolls. Florida says it has found 87 noncitizens on the rolls so far, though one person told he was a noncitizen turned out to be a Brooklyn-born WWII veteran, notes the Miami Herald. Florida's government has filed a federal lawsuit of its own, alleging that the Department of Homeland Security is illegally refusing to let the state access a federal database that would help it purge noncitizens from the rolls. "We can’t let the federal government delay our efforts to uphold the integrity of Florida elections any longer," Florida's secretary of state told reporters.

Going public was the "only way" to "change the system" that takes advantage of clients, he tells 60 Minutes. "The quickest way to make money on Wall Street is to take the most sophisticated product and try to sell it to the least sophisticated client," he says. He wasn't seeking "destruction" in the piece, he says; instead, he writes, he was concerned about the company he loved. Smith tells the AP his goal is to educate those who know little about the financial world. "If people are not educated about what the issues are, they're powerless," he says. What others are saying about the book: Though Goldman finds "no evidence whatsoever to support" Smith's claims, the book could have "a long-term effect on the firm" when it comes to hiring—if people believe Smith, writes Susanne Craig in the New York Times. Times reviewer James Stewart isn't convinced, noting that the book "fails to deliver concrete examples to back up his sweeping conclusions." The book may have been marketed well, but it doesn't contain much in the way of "bombshell revelations," writes Lauren LaCapra at Reuters. Reviewers haven't been impressed, with some suggesting it's a "misleading" read. Indeed, between interviews and the book, Smith seems to contradict himself on clients' sophistication, notes Nathan Vardi at Forbes. He tells the story, for instance, of a major client who noted that even though he didn't trust Goldman, he'd continue working with the firm.

She reported the incident—and though no charges were filed, it's making headlines because one of the people allegedly involved is the husband of Lahoma Mayor Theresa Sharp, the Enid News & Eagle reports. Authorities say a responding deputy found Cary Kent Sharp, 47, and his friends dressed in white robes (Sharp, at least, was not wearing a hood, the deputy says) and having a bonfire, though the local sheriff says no cross was actually burned. "There was no cross that burned," Mayor Sharp says. "It was held behind the fire to look like it was burning, but there was no fire. ... It was a prank gone bad." Her husband goes a bit further, calling the uproar "ridiculous, really," he says. "It was a Halloween night." Cary Sharp felt a bit differently by the time he was interviewed by News 9; he told the station he and his friends were sitting around the bonfire drinking beer "and thought, well, my buddy, his last name is White and the subject got brung (sic) up. We just thought it'd be something to do and it's not something to do." He added, "I am embarrassed. I've shamed my family and friends and I apologize for that." His wife later bemoaned the "stupidity" to KOCO. A Facebook photo of the bonfire drew more attention to the incident, which the sheriff says displayed "bad decision-making" and "very poor judgment," but about which little could be done thanks to the First Amendment (the group did agree to take off the robes and put the fire out). Meister wasn't happy about how it was handled: "Many people and children were out for evening festivities. Unfortunately, now this is something we have to talk to our children about."

The department is suing on behalf of the EPA, alleging that VW violated the Clean Air Act with its popular line of diesel vehicles, reports USA Today. While it may sound like a big move, the New York Times points out that the suit does not involve criminal charges or charges against any company executives, calling the development "something of a blow to the Obama administration's highly promoted new strategy for getting tough on corporate crime." Still, Reuters notes that the suit doesn't preclude criminal charges in the future. "With today’s filing, we take an important step to protect public health by seeking to hold Volkswagen accountable for any unlawful air pollution, setting us on a path to resolution," says an EPA official. "So far, recall discussions with the company have not produced an acceptable way forward. These discussions will continue in parallel with the federal court action."

Military officials say that Robert Bales acted alone, but some survivors spoke of seeing up to 20 soldiers, MSNBC reports. One 8-year-old girl says the shooter shot her father before shooting her in the leg while other men were present, holding lights. A woman whose husband was killed during the incident says there were up to 20 Americans pointing their guns at her. Hakim—who says US investigators tried to prevent her from speaking to child survivors—also spoke to the Afghan general whom President Hamid Karzai has assigned to investigate the killings. He told her that village elders believe several soldiers took part in the massacre, and they found the boot prints of three or four people. Other Afghans, however, say they only saw one soldier leave the base that night, CNN reports.

With the "God particle" now under its belt, CERN is hoping for bigger and better things out of LHC 2.0, reports the BBC—including about twice the operating energy achieved during its first time around and more violent collisions."It's fantastic to see it going so well after two years and such a major overhaul of the LHC," says CERN director Rolf Heuer. The collider is set to hit its stride in June, and scientists are hoping this time for a peek at dark matter, notes the AP.

A survivor told one of the rescuers there was "this real big wave coming—bigger than the rest of the big rollers ... it picked the boat off and it fell off the wave, it started tumbling," per the Globe and Mail. Although the weather was said to have been calm, local sailors say strong currents and rogue waves can happen even then, the BBC notes. And although the vessel's owner says it was manned by a veteran skipper and had safely made the same trip every day for 20 years, the boat's design is being scrutinized. "We know that most passengers were on the top deck on the port side," an investigator with the board tells the Guardian. "This would have raised the center of gravity, affecting the vessel's stability." Details are now trickling out about the victims—all of whom had been standing on the top deck and none of whom had life jackets on, the British Columbia coroner notes—including an 18-year-old with Down syndrome and his 50-year-old father, per the Guardian. Meanwhile, local fishermen from a Native American tribe who were among the first to the site after seeing a flare go up are being praised for their efforts. "More lives would have been lost if not for the [Ahousaht] First Nation," BC Premier Christy Clark tells the paper. "We're all incredibly grateful." Those who helped recall people clinging to the boat (which the BBC notes had no time to send out a mayday signal) and covered in diesel fuel. "It's something you really can't describe," one rescuer tells the Guardian. "It's going to be held with me for the rest of my life." (A tourist was killed by a jumping whale in Mexico.)

The trio face up to 30 years each in prison, but won't know their fate until later today, reports Oak Ridge Today. Supporters in the courtroom sang "Love, love, love, love. People, we are made for love," as nun Megan Rice, Michael R. Walli, 64, and Greg Boertje-Obed, 57, were taken into custody, the Washington Post reports. The three activists cut through four chain fences and spray-painted biblical messages on the walls of the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where most of the country's weapons-grade uranium is stored. "Our intent was to bring healing and forgiveness and love," said Rice, but prosecutors say they caused $8,532 of damage to property and also threatened national defense. "Three senior citizens showing up with backpacks is a threat to the United States of America?” questioned their defense attorney. "That threatens us? I don’t think so ... Opposing [nuclear weapons] is not something that opposes the national defense of the United States."

"That was wrong," says the IRS official in charge of tax-exempt groups. "That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. The IRS would like to apologize for that." She swears it wasn't politically motivated, but conservatives such as Mitch McConnell are demanding a fuller accounting, and various Tea Party groups want resignations to follow. Conservative groups have been complaining for more than a year of unfair treatment by the IRS, reports the Washington Post. The back story here is that scores of political groups filed for nonprofit status last year, a distinction that puts them under the authority of the IRS instead of the Federal Election Commission, reports Politico. (One of the advantages is that they can hide donors.) The IRS agents—described as "career employees" working out of Cincinnati who got assigned to look into the increase in applications—were investigating to see whether such groups were dabbling too much in politics to qualify as nonprofits. The agency issued another statement today saying it should have done a "better job of handling the influx of advocacy applications. Mistakes were made initially, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan rationale.”

(One quit, one supervisor retired, and another supervisor is in the process of being fired.) The New York Times, meanwhile, scored an interview with the 24-year-old escort at the heart of the case, the one whose argument with an agent over payment—"I tell him, 'Baby, my cash money'"—sparked the whole mess. Among the details: She says a group of US men approached her and a friend at a disco, and she agreed to accompany one guy back to his hotel for $800. The agents were "very discreet" and never said they were with the president. The next morning, her client said he didn't remember the deal, gave her $30, and ordered her from the room. She made a scene in the hallway, and other Americans got her about $225, so she left. By then, however, hotel security and local cops were on the scene.

The statement was one of a number of "outbursts" made by the accused Colorado Planned Parenthood shooter as prosecutors brought 179 charges against him, CBS Denver reports. Dear also stated: “You’ll never know the amount of blood I saw in that place.” And 9News notes he repeated the phrase "protect the babies" multiple times during the hearing. According to the AP, that phrase is similar to "no more baby parts," which Dear repeated during his arrest. The 57-year-old Dear is accused of killing three people and wounding many more on Nov. 27 during an attack on a Planned Parenthood location in Colorado Springs, the AP reports. According to CBS, the scores of charges brought against Dear Wednesday include murder. During the hearing, Dear refused a mental health evaluation and said he didn't want to meet again with his lawyer—Daniel King—who he accused of trying to "drug him all up" like the "Batman shooter," 9News reports. "I think the problem is obvious, judge," responded King, who previously represented the Aurora theater shooter. Dear's next court date is scheduled for Dec. 23. It is unclear if prosecutors will seek the death penalty.

Per Veterans of Foreign Wars estimates, the remains of as many as 5,300 could still be in North Korea. Now, as one of four key points President Trump and Kim Jong Un agreed to during their historic summit, those remains could be coming home, NPR reports. "The United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains, including the immediate repatriation of those already identified," says the statement released after Trump's summit with the North Korean leader. The US and North Korea worked together to recover 229 sets of American remains between 1996 and 2005 during a thawing of relations between the two countries, Fox News reports. The VFW had asked Trump to raise the issue during negotiations. Families "want the remains of their sons back," Trump said. "They want the remains of their fathers, and mothers, and all of the people that got caught into that really brutal war, which took place, to a large extent, in North Korea. And I asked for it today, and we got it." He said that though he asked at the last minute, Kim agreed "so quickly" and was "so nice" about it: "He understands it. He understands it."

As part of that probe, Scientific American publishes a look at one such federal investigation into how nearly 100 researchers who gathered at a Nevada center in 2014 made "several grievous errors" while conducting a supposedly safe nuclear-pulse experiment with a machine called Godiva. Their carelessness led to them unknowingly breathing in radioactive uranium, which they didn't discover until months later. The report details the pressure scientists were under to complete their work at the National Criticality Experiments Research Center, how a protective cover failed to be reinstalled during a product reassembly in 2012, and how one particular decision turned out to be a risky one. That decision: to turn off annoying radioactivity-detecting alarms that kept going off as Godiva emitted its bursts. The scientists didn't realize that by shutting off the alarms, they were also closing off ventilation systems and air filters. While the doses they inhaled weren't especially high—at worst, the equivalent of 13 chest X-rays—they're enough to pose an added cancer risk for the scientists. Scientific American details how the first researcher discovered, on his own during routine testing two months later, that his health was at his risk, as well as the "shroud of official secrecy" that sheltered the experiment itself as well as the mishap that had occurred at the test site. The report also documents how financial penalties apparently weren't harsh enough to force major changes. More on the debacle here. (Did a uranium mine sicken a remote village in Kazakhstan?)

A Change.org petition urging the Commission on Presidential Debates to have the former Daily Show host moderate one of the three major debates ahead of the general election is picking up steam and now has more than 130,000 signatures, CNN reports. Petition starter Mariel Waters says Stewart is a trusted and popular figure who has interviewed 15 heads of state and "scores of other political leaders from this country and around the world." "Many in the US believe Jon Stewart shares their worldview and values," the petition states, citing a Reuters poll that found more than 50% of Americans agree with him on "some or most" issues. Martin O'Malley, who would like to see the Democrats have more than six presidential debates, announced on Twitter last night that he has signed the petition. An O'Malley spokeswoman tells the Washington Post that the former Maryland governor is a Daily Show fan and that a "Jon Stewart-moderated debate would be more informative than the Trump-dominated GOP sideshow that's going unanswered, so he's game."

The civilization later recovered, but history would repeat itself just a few hundred years later, delivering a final blow, researchers explain in a PNAS study offering a clear chronology of the civilization's demise. It's based on 154 radiocarbon dates from charcoal samples along with data from ceramics at the site of Ceibal in Guatemala which show "similar patterns" of warfare around 75 BC and AD 735, reports the International Business Times. Each was followed by a period of political upheaval, the first of which led into the Preclassic collapse of AD 150-300. Ceibal then saw a population decline and many other Maya cities were abandoned. But with "the development of dynasties centered on divine rulership," the civilization soon after rallied as power centralized, say researchers at the University of Arizona. However, warfare returned a few centuries later, resulting in a new period of political instability. This one led into the Classic collapse circa AD 800-950, when Ceibal again experienced a population decline, according to a release. But this time, power splintered and the Maya were unable to recover. Archaeologists now hope to survey other Maya sites for similar patterns of decline that may show why the Classic collapse proved fatal. (This Maya pyramid hides two others.)

Two hours later, when family members went to the morgue to dress Valdelucio de Oliveira Goncalves' body, they noticed the closed body bag moving up and down as if he were still breathing, reports news.com.au. They implored staff to free him, given he was tied up and his ears and nose were stuffed with cotton wool. The family, who was told three months ago that the man is dying of terminal cancer, has already opened an inquiry into the matter, reports the BBC. "Hospital directors will meet the team who saw the patient to clarify the course of action taken," the local health department said in a statement.

The report sparked an eight-hour search in Sacramento, complete with helicopters, the Sacramento Bee reports. In an interview with CBS 13, Vaughn began to cry as she pleaded for her daughter's safe return. “We’re just looking for her to bring her home,” she said. “Please.” Now, however, police say it was all an act. As it turns out, young Laprea Lee was safe and sound at the home of Antwan Holliday, Vaughn’s boyfriend, the whole time, KCRA reports. Vaughn, 43, and Holliday, 44, face felony and misdemeanor charges related to hiding the girl, filing a false police report, and obstructing police. Police say Vaughn staged the whole thing for revenge because she was upset that her daughter had been dropped off about 15 minutes early after a camping trip with the girl’s father, Don Lee, forcing her to rush home, per CBS. (The girl was dropped off by her grandfather.) Vaughn told police that when she arrived home, Laprea was nowhere to be found, and she accused the girl's father of taking her. Police say a tipster eventually told them that Laprea was with Holliday, leading to the ruse being discovered.

Cruise's plan is to totally spoil 6-year-old daughter Suri, thus thoroughly annoying Holmes. "While she’s trying to instill a routine and introduce more discipline, Tom could swoop in with a fun-only policy," a source tells Look magazine in an article picked up by Australia's News Network. Cruise recently took Suri on a helicopter ride and, reportedly, bought her a bunch of designer clothes and shoes. He may even move to New York City to be closer to his daughter, a source tells Grazia. "Until now, Scientology has been a very LA-centric movement, but another reason Tom will be keen to relocate … is to focus on developing the church in Manhattan." Speaking of the church, fellow Scientologist John Travolta is disgusted by Cruise's "weak" behavior, believing he "rolled over" in the aforementioned divorce settlement and failed to "man up," thus making "a laughingstock" of Scientology, a source tells the National Enquirer. And what is Holmes up to? Well, she canceled her first public appearance since the split, a red carpet walk at an event for a foundation that promotes dance education, which Holmes co-founded. "Her security team had concerns about the situation, especially the daytime event given it was being held in a public park," a source tells Celebuzz.

Speaking in Spanish, Reuters notes that Benedict implored the crowd, "I beg you to continue praying for me and for the next pope." He triumphantly raised his arms outstretched to the crowd in his second-to-last Angelus blessing before leaving the papacy. A huge banner in the square read: "We love you." The appointment today is one of the most cherished traditions of the Catholic Church, and this moment is one of Benedict's last opportunities to connect with the Catholic masses.

But during the final years of his life, that love turned to stress as Donovan felt he was being bullied by Nadine Hendricken, his supervisor at Queens County Residential Services. The stress got so bad he and his wife, Lisa, started fearing for his health. On Oct. 31, 2013, he collapsed at home. He died days later of cardiac arrest at age 47. Now, Lisa has been awarded benefits after the Workers Compensation Board of Prince Edward Island determined that Donovan's death was linked to bullying and harassment in the workplace, the CBC reports. Eric Donovan had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused his death, the board heard. The suit also claimed he had been forced to do unsafe work and work extra hours, the Guardian reported last year. Donovan's co-workers testified that Hendricken was known as a bully, while Donovan was known as "helpful and generous" to his colleagues and "conscientious and compassionate" with group home residents. Per his widow, things got really bad after Donovan injured his back during an attempt to restrain an aggressive client on Sept. 30, 2013. Lisa alleges that Hendricken had called Donovan a "wimp," in front of his co-workers, prior to the incident, and that when he returned to work after his medical leave, she "berated" him as "weak," again in front of colleagues. Donovan also told his wife that he overheard Hendricken telling someone else that she believed he was faking the injury. QCRS has filed an appeal, and the organization's executive director says Donovan never filed a complaint about his alleged bullying. (A 13-year-old boy who committed suicide left behind a letter on bullying.)

The village in Maharashtra has been chosen for the launch of India's ambitious project to collect fingerprints and iris scans from all of its 1.2 billion people—and assign them unique 12-digit ID numbers. Experts of Indian origin from around the world have been recruited to help with the massive project, the Wall Street Journal reports. Registration is voluntary for now but the government, aiming to reduce fraud, plans to tie the biometric IDs to provision of social services. The project's backers say it will improve the lot of India's poor, who often have no documents to prove who they are. Some question whether India's less-than-reliable Internet infrastructure can handle that much data, but its creators promise that privacy will be strictly protected. Once the data reach central servers, "it never leaves, its like a black hole," the project's architect tells the Times of India.

In a tweet late Friday—just before tweeting that he would be taking a break from Twitter—Musk responded to a question about his ill-fated tweet claiming he would take the company private, which resulted in $40 million in SEC fines and him stepping down as company chairman, reports Reuters. "Worth It," he tweeted. Given that the ink is barely dry on the SEC fines, Gizmodo thinks that Musk's plan to take a break from "(firing) off word salad at all hours of the day and night" for a while "doesn’t seem like such a bad long-term plan."

The reason for the latter, as spelled out in Vox, is an apparent rising concern over labor issues and Amazon's monopolistic ways. But while Palus applauds those making a statement by ditching Prime, she's not about to cast judgment on those who won't. "It’s simply not a step that everyone can take, and that’s not just because people are unwilling to forgo convenience," she writes. "It’s easy to forget, because everyone has to do it and it’s often pleasurable, but shopping is labor." Prime, especially for those struggling to make ends meet, can be "a Band-Aid, helping them save money and time," writes Palus. She talks to several people who explain why they don't feel they can give it up, including a young couple who have giant boxes of diapers delivered to their second-floor condo at a discount of 20%. She suggests that people like this who still want to support the Amazon protests can cut back in smaller ways, like not taking part in additional services such as same-day delivery. And they can also be vocal about their concerns. "Small actions, if broadcast to a social network and in turn, to politicians, can help spur that change." Read the full piece.

Brandon Bostian, 32, does remember being banged around in the crash and ultimately regaining consciousness and calling 911, but he has "no explanation" for what caused the accident, his lawyer says, adding that the Queens resident had "no health issues to speak of" before the crash and was not taking any medication. Bostian, who suffered leg injuries, a concussion, and a head injury requiring 14 staples, has given police a blood sample and his cellphone and is cooperating with investigators. Meanwhile, NTSB member Robert Sumwalt says that it appears from the train's data recorder that the train was indeed going 106mph before Bostian pressed the emergency brake, and was going 102mph by the time the recording ended three seconds later. As earlier reported, the speed limit before the curve where the train derailed is 70mph; at the curve, the limit goes down to 50mph. And Sumwalt offers this devastating sentence to the New York Times: "We feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred." He's talking about technology called "positive train control," which can automatically slow or even halt trains to stop accidents. It's in place on parts of the Northeast Corridor, but not the portion of the track where the derailment occurred. Congress mandated that it be installed everywhere by the end of this year, but due to challenges getting it in place, the deadline could be extended to 2020. "Clearly it was reckless in terms of the driving by the engineer. There's no way in the world he should have been going that fast into the curve," Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter tells CNN. But Sumwalt says the NTSB will "get the facts before we start making judgments," noting that a mechanical problem like faulty brakes could be to blame.

Some 25 students started Jackson County Spelling Bee's championship round on Saturday, but after just 19 rounds, 11-year old Sophia Hoffman and Kush Sharma, 13, were the only two left standing for what an organizer says was a "legendary" showdown, the Kansas City Star reports. They spelled words including "scherzo,” "fantoccini," and "intaglio" correctly before the words ran out and organizers decided to halt the contest instead of plucking random words from the dictionary, reports the AP. The showdown will resume on March 8, and it will be a tougher challenge for both contestants: They will have to spell words taken anywhere from the Merriam-Webster dictionary's 1,664 page instead of from the Scripps-approved list of 300 words. The winner will move on to the National Spelling Bee in May.

The Army psychiatrist, who called the beard a "deeply sincere" symbol of his Islamic faith, began growing it after killing 13 people in the November 2009 shooting. An Army spokesman says Hasan was shaved at the prison, where officials had previously said he would be subject to military grooming regulations, the AP reports. But that doesn't seem obvious to Hasan's former civilian lawyer, who tells ABC News that he plans to sue over the shaving. "Forcibly shaving him after a military council approved the beard for the duration of the trial smacks of retaliation by Army officials," John Galligan said. "This was a vindictive act." Galligan says he'll consult with other lawyers, and then probably file a federal suit. Authorities also tell ABC that, given military regulations, a video of the shave must exist.

John Constantino "was a loving father and husband," and his death "was not a political act or statement," the 64-year-old's family said in a statement, the AP reports. The family would like to acknowledge "the heroism of the paramedics and bystanders who attempted to save his life," the statement says. The family's lawyer says he is "not aware of any anti-government statements made by him or any ill will he may have had against the government." His neighbors say they are baffled by the death of the man they describe as friendly and happy. He had complained about the government to neighbors—though only in terms that many ordinary Americans would agree with. "He said they were a waste of time, effort, and money," one neighbor tells the New York Daily News. "He said to me, 'They’re no good. They don’t look out for us and they don’t care about anything but their own pockets.'"

A fellow student is in custody, and police think a specific dispute between the two of them led to the shooting. Also of note: Police say an armed school resource officer—of the type the NRA is pushing—disarmed the suspect minutes after the shooting, though he happened to be off-duty at the time, reports AP. The school had metal detectors, and authorities are trying to figure out how the small-caliber handgun apparently got through them. The shooting reportedly took place outside in a school courtyard. "Gun violence in and around our schools is simply unconscionable and must end," said Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. "Too many young people are being harmed, and too many families are suffering from unimaginable and unnecessary grief."

Bachmann, who announced her candidacy during the debate, was "at ease and forceful without looking at all crazy or out-of-control," writes EJ Dionne Jr. at the Washington Post. Romney, meanwhile, "did not lose anything," he notes, "which means that, since he leads in the polls in New Hampshire, he is a kind of winner." Romney "couldn't have scripted an easier debate for himself, writes Alexander Burns and Maggie Haberman at Politico. He went in "looking strong and emerged from it stronger, as his opponents repeatedly passed up opportunities to go on the attack—and even inflicted damage on themselves as they tried to avoid confrontation." The real winner was the Tea Party, concludes Ronald Brownstein at the National Journal. All seven hopefuls appeared to be "operating in a policy framework shaped by the Tea Party push to retrench government," and none of them—not even Newt Gingrich—directly criticized Rep. Paul Ryan's plan for Medicare reform, he notes. Bachmann deserves the "most improved" medal for her performance, but all seven candidates were winners in their own way, according to Juli Weiner at Vanity Fair. Tim Pawlenty deserves the "least willing to insult Mitt Romney" award, while Herman Cain wins "most conspicuously overshadowed by Michele Bachmann," and Rick Santorum scores for "nicest blue tie," she writes.

The investigation, however, is suspended and not closed in case Jackie wants to cooperate further in the future. The lack of evidence "doesn't mean something terrible didn't happen," said the police chief.

Three witnesses related to the victim say Jonathan Sanders was riding a horse-drawn buggy in Stonewall when he made a comment to officer Kevin Herrington, who had pulled over a driver. He said something like, "Why don't you leave that man alone?" the lawyer tells the Guardian. The driver who was pulled over says he then heard Herrington say, "I'm going to get that n*****," before confronting an unarmed Sanders. Police say there was "a fight," while witnesses say Sanders was choked with a head-mounted light he'd been wearing and twice uttered, "I can't breathe." A witness offered to perform CPR, but Herrington reportedly refused. Medical examiners have ruled Sanders' death a homicide by asphyxiation. "We believe there is probable cause for a prosecution," says the lawyer. Meanwhile a second death in police custody in Texas has family and friends demanding justice. Sandra Bland, 28—a civil rights activist, per NBC News—was arrested for assault during a traffic stop last Friday and booked at Waller County Jail. Officials say they spoke with Bland at 8am Monday—the day she was to be released on $5,000 bond—but returned to find her dead in her cell. The Chicago Tribune reports her death was ruled a suicide by hanging, but relatives say that's "totally absurd" since she had "a thirst for life" and was about to start a new job. "I will admit it is strange someone who had everything going for her would have taken her own life," a district attorney tells KPRC. "That's why it's very important a thorough investigation is done and that we get a good picture of what Ms. Bland was going through the last four or five days of her life." People are debating the case with hashtags #JusticeForSandy and #WhatHappenedToSandyBland, while an online petition calls for the DOJ to intervene.

A jury this summer found that Samsung had knowingly infringed on Apple's patents, but that's not sufficient grounds for a ban, Judge Lucy Koh says. Instead, Apple would have to prove "irreparable harm" by demonstrating that customers were choosing specific Samsung devices over the Cupertino company's own, Forbes reports. Koh also noted that just "a small fraction" of Apple's features suffered infringement, and "it does not follow that entire products must be forever banned from the market," Reuters reports. Apple is likely to appeal the move, Forbes notes. In better news for the US firm, Koh nixed Samsung's call for a new trial over jury bias—leaving the $1.05 billion ruling in place, Mashable notes. Meanwhile, Samsung is ditching its bids for injunctions against Apple in Europe, where the European Commission in January planned an antitrust probe over Samsung patents. "We strongly believe it is better when companies compete fairly in the marketplace, rather than in court," the company said in a statement to the Verge.

Microsoft has just released the public beta version of a new Project Oxford tool that uses artificial intelligence to recognize "eight core emotional states" on people's faces in photographs. If you express anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or surprise and you show it, the tool will catch on, reports Microsoft; the eighth state it registers is "neutral." Project Oxford has been working on machine-based learning for a while now, reports Ars Technica. There's even a Movember-related sub-service, MyMoustache.net, through which users can upload images of their mustaches and get rated. Several users are already tweeting out the results of their own photos or those of famous people, reports the New York Daily News. For instance, one image of Hitler is calculated as mostly neutral (0.82048) but with smaller amounts of sadness (0.10757) and anger (0.07123) and trace amounts of contempt, disgust, fear, and surprise. The smiling cat owner next to him in the tweet, meanwhile, is 100% happy. Not all examples appear to get it exactly right, however; a forlorn-looking Keanu Reeves (aka "Sad Keanu") on a bench is only 0.01831 sad and actually 0.00035 happy, reports the Verge. (Still, it's looking better than Microsoft's age-guessing algorithm from earlier this year.)

Just this week, Republicans in at least four states introduced legislation restricting abortion, the New York Daily News reports. In Michigan, for instance, 23 Republicans this week co-sponsored a version of the transvaginal ultrasound bill that proved so divisive in Virginia. Last night Michigan's Republican House speaker said he wouldn't pass the bill, MSNBC reports. "I have absolutely no interest in forcing women to have a transvaginal ultrasound," he said. But Michigan is hardly alone. A bill in Tennessee would require women to undergo a standard ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion; another in Alabama could regulate its remaining clinics out of business; and a pair in Arkansas would forbid some insurance coverage for abortions and ban them entirely after 12 weeks. Publicly, DC Republicans say these state efforts won't damage the national brand. But "it can muddy the message the national party is trying to develop," one former House GOP strategist admits.

Of course, it wasn't until the Daily Mail got hold of it that the story took off, with this slightly revised headline: "Bad news for 220-mile high club: Researchers find sex in space could lead to life-threatening illnesses." This led to a spate of sex-in-space-can-kill-you stories. So what gives? It turns out that amorous space travelers probably don't have to worry—unless they're having sex for the specific purpose of producing offspring, explains Daily Kos. Essentially, the researchers studied plant sex in zero gravity and found big problems in the reproduction process related to how cells communicate with each other. They did not draw any conclusions about human sex, but the possibility of similar problems affecting people can't be ruled out yet, says LiveScience. "What does this mean?" asks Daily Kos. "It means we may not be able to colonize the Moon or Mars anytime soon, not until we lick many, many problems." But at least the couple who might be blasting off to Mars should be able to ... unwind.

Specifically, she wondered why Black Lives Matter is the only "problem you're allowed to talk about." “Is Beyoncé or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters?" MIA continued. "That’s a more interesting question. And you cannot ask it on a song that’s on Apple, you cannot ask it on an American TV program, you cannot create that tag on Twitter, Michelle Obama is not going to hump you back.” In response to MIA's comments, one Black Lives Matter organizer said the singer "really has no clue," the Guardian reports. According to Entertainment Weekly, another Black Lives Matter activist took issue with the idea that America "allows" you to say black lives matter, as protesters doing just that were teargassed. MIA later clarified on Twitter that she wasn't criticizing anyone in particular; "My question was," she wrote, "on American platforms what do they allow you to stand up for in 2016. This has been the number 1 question for me." The issue came up when MIA was asked about Beyoncé's performance at this year's Super Bowl. MIA is no stranger to Super Bowl controversies; she was fined by the NFL for flipping the bird while performing with Madonna in 2012.

"There are three types of women in the Army,” one of the female victims tells the Daily Beast. “Bitch, dyke, and whore.” The suit names defense chief Robert Gates and predecessor Donald Rumsfeld, accusing them of presiding over an institution that allows everything from verbal abuse to rape to go unpunished. As a result, victims often have to go on serving alongside their assailants. One example cited: An Army Reservist says two male soldiers raped her in Iraq, videotaped it, and circulated the tape within the unit, reports AP. Her commander took no action because he concluded she "did not struggle enough." The lawsuit "may become a landmark case to force the military to take rape and sexual assault seriously," writes Andrea Stone at Aol News. "Or it could be yet another failed attempt in a decades-long battle by women to be accepted in the armed forces." Click for more.

Blamed by some Instagram followers for ex-boyfriend Mac Miller's death on Friday, the 25-year-old disabled comments on her social media feed, reports People. Commenters hurled lowballs like "You lowkey evil," "Damn u killed the homie," and "I HOPE YOURE [sic] HAPPY WITH PETE [Davidson]," according to a tweet from Pop Crave. Grande has kept mum about the rapper's death, posting only a quick video of her UK hotel room with the words, "Bye London." The "No Tears Left to Cry" singer has been down this road before, when Miller was arrested in May for a DUI following his breakup with Grande. Naturally, some blamed her for his behavior. "I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be," she wrote on Twitter at the time. "I have cared for him and tried to support his sobriety and prayed for his balance for years (and always will of course) but shaming/blaming women for a man's inability to keep his s— together is a very major problem." Miller blamed himself for the DUI, per People, but that didn't stop some from criticizing Grande this time around. Now it seems the Twitterverse is on her side: "I hope Ariana has a strong support systems [sic] because the locals are intent on blaming her for something she has no business being blamed for ... AGAIN," reads a sample tweet. "Wishing you nothing but peace and strength." Miller died of a suspected drug overdose.

That sums up the British Library's announcement about a blade discovered in an English river in 1825, LiveScience reports. The so-called River Witham sword—a 13th-century object now on display at the library—bears a message along its 38-inch steel blade: "+NDXOXCHWDRGHDXORVI+." The "indecipherable inscription" is "along one of its edges and inlaid in gold wire," writes curator Julian Harrison on the library blog. "It has been speculated that this is a religious invocation, since the language is unknown." Indeed, Marc van Hasselt, one of the blog's many commenters, sees religious-themed Latin short forms in the message and notes that Latin was the "international language of choice" among 13th-century Europeans. Van Hasselt, a medieval-studies student in the Netherlands, says the opening "ND" may be "Nostrum Dominus (our Lord) or Nomine Domini (name of the Lord)" and the "XOX" may refer to the holy trinity. He references work done by Thomas Wagner and John Worley, whose Fyris Swords Project examines such inscribed medieval swords and tries to give them historical context. LiveScience points to a 2009 paper in Weaponry and Costumes in which Fyris researchers wrote "most ... unidentified medieval sword inscriptions could be invocations. This type is basically characterized by a Christian cross at the beginning and sometimes at the end of the inscription"—perhaps as with the River Witham sword, which was likely "owned by a wealthy individual or knight" and may have been "part of the ceremony of Knighthood," the British Museum adds. Still, writes Harrison, "It could be a mystery that may never be solved!" (See how "Yoda" turned up in the library's Medieval Manuscripts blog.)

The Pentagon is toying with the idea of turning Tinian and Pagan—small US territories in the Northern Mariana Islands—into a place to stage war 16 weeks a year. What locals (who are US citizens) think: Pagan's mayor says the people are 100% against the move, which some equate to an "invasion," the Guardian reports. While Pagan has been uninhabited since a 1981 volcanic eruption, mayor Jerome Aldan says about 50 families aim to return to the 10-mile-long stretch of land. Tinian's 3,000 residents—some of whom own land already leased to the military—could be forced onto a 10-square-mile area. And the plan, which could be put into action by 2017, doesn't just affect people. Biologist Mike Hadfield describes Pagan as a "biological treasure trove" boasting rare fruit bats and tree snails. A rep for the Marine Corps in the Pacific told the Los Angeles Times last month, "We would protect it like it was our own." (Hadfield's response: "Anyone who believes the US Marines and Navy when they say they'll leave the place better than they found it must be slightly crazy.") The weeks of war games could see major amphibious assaults, ground maneuvers, and the placement of bombing targets on Mt. Pagan. Why here? The next decade will see thousands of Marines relocated to Guam from Okinawa; the Pentagon is scrambling for training sites in the region. Pagan is just 330 miles north of Guam and has been IDed as having beaches big enough for sizable amphibious assaults—though the Times points out the Marines haven't staged such an assault in a combat capacity since 1950. A Change.org petition against the plan has garnered more than 110,000 signatures.

A video of the incident posted Monday has more than 1.6 million views and includes the lines, "Just give me some f---ing bacon jalapeno mac and cheese" and "I'm very hungry, man." Luke Gatti—who was being denied mac and cheese because he was allegedly intoxicated and carrying a container of alcohol, which is against campus policy—also hurls slurs and gets physical with workers at the campus eatery in the nine-minute video before finally being taken down by one of the workers and then arrested as he yells, among other things, "Let me get my shoes. What the f--- happened to my shoes?" He was charged with trespassing and breach of peace, the Hartford Courant reports; other students have been tweeting that he was also expelled.

The legislation would boost the debt ceiling by $1 trillion, the Washington Post reports—though Dems say in order to avoid default, they might OK a short-term solution instead, even if it lasts just weeks. Politico, however, reports a divide between top Senate Democrats and the White House, with the former frustrated that the administration is showing flexibility. Though the administration is now distancing itself from a short-term plan, senators fear the president may be inching closer to negotiating with Republicans over the default risk. That risk is growing, with experts telling the Hill that the "drop-dead date" to raise the ceiling is, perhaps appropriately, Halloween. "The one thing we know for sure is that by Nov. 1, they will be out of money," says a Goldman Sachs analyst. That's when $67 billion in Social Security, Medicare, military, and other payments are due. Meanwhile, lawmakers are working on sending back payments to furloughed workers—but even that is running into problems. After the House unanimously passed a measure to do so, Republican Sen. John Cornyn warned that it was "premature to be dealing with that until we deal with the underlying problem," Roll Call reports. Senate Dems plan an up-or-down vote that aides say is likely to get the measure through, the Post notes. Some 70% of Americans disapprove of the GOP's budget tactics, a Post-ABC News poll finds; 61% disapprove of congressional Democrats' handling of the situation, while Obama's disapproval rating is at 51%. His approval rating, however, climbed from 41% to 45% in the past week.

That combination has yielded neighbor vs. neighbor lawsuits in the Stoney Hollow neighborhood of Plano, Texas. It all started with the placement of a playhouse with an attached swingset in the side yard of Kelly and Andrew Counts' home, CBS DFW reports. In fact, one of the reasons the family chose the home in 2014 was that it had a concrete patio ideal for such a structure, Kelly Counts tells the Dallas Morning News. Next-door neighbors Irving and Anita Ward, who have declined to comment on the situation, disagreed. The Wards complained to the neighborhood homeowners association that the structure detracted from their "tranquil quality of life" and produced "noise issues as well as visibility issues for them and their pets," per HOA minutes obtained by CBS. The city also fielded a complaint regarding the location of the structure in relation to the property line; the family removed part of the playhouse roof to appease the city, and the HOA signed off on the structure. That's when, according to the Counts, the Wards began blasting the music when her four kids, ages 2 to 10, played outside. "I don't feel comfortable in my own backyard," she tells CBS. Counts says the Wards wouldn't have a conversation about the issue, so she and her husband filed a civil suit in October, FOX 4 reports. The music stopped—and then the Wards in December sued the Countses, "alleging loud and obnoxious noise," per the Morning News, and claiming they and their property have been damaged; they want the structure taken down. The parties will be in court this month and next. (This woman, bothered by noisy neighborhood kids, allegedly made a darker move.)

Doing so would give them manufactured fingerprints that could unlock his phone and perhaps glean clues about who killed him. The New York Daily News reports Michigan cops tracked Jain down after seeing a video he posted on YouTube that got into using re-created fingerprints to unlock phones. Without getting into specific details about the still-underway investigation, Jain and his PhD student assistant fill Fusion in about the unusual investigative method. The victim had been arrested at one point, so police were able to give Jain a scan of his fingerprints; because it wasn't clear which finger the victim used to unlock his Samsung Galaxy S6, Jain will work up all 10. One particularly pesky complication: Readers rely on the conductive nature of human skin, so Jain has to add a "micron level coating" with tiny metallic pieces to the plastic fingers to make them conductive. Mashable reports he's been testing a variety of conductive materials. Whether this type of technology could be used on living suspects is another matter: Fusion notes it gets "murky," especially with Fifth Amendment protections for "contents of the mind" (a memorized password), but not for "tangible" corporeal evidence such as fingerprints. As far as the legal implications of breaking into the dead man's phone, any info found that could link the victim to any crimes wouldn't matter anyway as he's now deceased. It would a different story if cops wanted to break into the (ostensibly living) murderer's phone, notes 3DPrint.com. Jain expects to have the fingers ready for police in a few weeks. (Speaking of skin, how would you feel about clothing made from it?)

It's good news for Lehman's many creditors, but not great news considering the collapsed investment bank owes hundreds of billions. Lehman's has another auction next week, this time at Christie's. The Sotheby's sales actually exceeded expectations, notes LindsayPollack.com. Of the 142 lots, 83% found buyers. The top seller was Julie Mehretu's Untitled 1, which went to a private bidder for a little more than $1 million, while Liu Ye’s The Long Way Home went for $962,500. Both sold for significantly higher than expected. One of the unlucky ones was Damien Hirst's We've Got Style. Expected to be top dog at up to $1.2 million, it opened at $200,000 and found zero takers.

A lawmaker from Wisconsin says she wants wealthy Americans to get the same treatment before they can enjoy generous tax deductions, Yahoo News reports. Rep. Gwen Moore's "Top 1% Accountability Act of 2016" would require taxpayers with itemized deductions exceeding $150,000 to submit a clean drug test, according to a press release. If they refuse, they can take the lower standard deduction. "It is my sincere hope that my bill will help eradicate the stigma associated with poverty and engage the American public in a substantive dialogue regarding the struggles of working- and middle-class families," Moor says. According to the congresswomen, per the Guardian, the government spends $81 billion on poverty programs, while taxing capital gains at a lower rate than income costs the government $93 billion. "We might really save some money by drug-testing folks on Wall Street, who might have a little cocaine before they get their deal done," Moore tells the Guardian. NPR calls her bill an "implicit counterpunch" to welfare drug testing laws backed by Republicans. Some 15 states have passed laws to that require people who receive state welfare benefits to take drug tests. Among them are Florida, Michigan, and Moore's own Wisconsin, which also requires drug tests for people in the federal SNAP food stamp program. (The feds have said that's a no-no.) Supporters say drug testing saves money and acts as an incentive to keep people clean. Critics say drug tests are a cure for a problem that doesn't exist, citing stats from Florida that just 2% of welfare recipients failed drug tests and 2% declined to take the test.

Police say the revelers found little Sinaia Moore at the bottom of the 4-foot, inground pool and tried to revive her, but she was unresponsive, reports the AP. Paramedics arrived and took her to a hospital, but she was dead when they got there. Police say that earlier on, she wore a float vest in the pool, but no one noticed her re-enter the pool without a vest. "I see nothing that indicates that anyone was inattentive, negligent in any manner," a police sergeant told the Columbus Dispatch. "It just seems like this is clearly a sad, unfortunate accident." Many of the 75 to 100 partygoers were singing to the birthday girl, a 1-year-old, when Sinaia died.

Thus, "Sendak planted an immortal virus in the culture, a self-fulfilling prophecy of rumpus, an affirmation that the child’s-eye view of the world made total sense. I thank him dearly for it." Peter Dobrin, Philadelphia Inquirer: "In both his portrayal of the terrors of being a child and the deep flaws of adults, Mr. Sendak was a throwback to an earlier era in children's literature, when 19th century books like like Heinrich Hoffmann's Der Struwwelpeter lacked the sweetness and justice of a well-ordered world. " Margalit Fox, New York Times: He "wrenched the picture book out of the safe, sanitized world of the nursery and plunged it into the dark, terrifying and hauntingly beautiful recesses of the human psyche ..." Daniel Handler, Lemony Snickets author, to AP: "It's almost impossible to overstate his importance. He's a North Star in the firmament of anyone who makes children's books, in particular for his dark and clear-eyed view of the world that was kindred to me when I was in kindergarten and kindred to me now. He gives neither the comfort nor the horror of sentimentality."

The Omaha World-Herald reports the unnamed 53-year-old man's adult children left their marijuana brownies in the back of his car. He found them Tuesday night and—unaware they were special—ate four. He started getting "bad anxiety" while watching TV, and his wife called 911. Paramedics determined the man was OK apart from his behavior: He was, as the World-Herald puts it, "crawling around on the floor, randomly using profanities, and calling the family cat 'a bitch.'" He said he felt like he was "tripping." Paramedics put the man to bed, and no charges were filed. Marijuana Politics points out minor marijuana possession hasn't been an arrestable offense in Nebraska since the 1970s.

Under the Demographics Unit, later renamed the Zone Assessment Unit, plainclothes officers would infiltrate Muslim gathering places to learn what they could. The New York Times offers a snapshot: "Detectives were told to chat up the employees at Muslim-owned businesses and 'gauge sentiment' about America and foreign policy. Through maps and photographs, the police noted where Albanian men played chess in the afternoon, where Egyptians watched soccer and where South Asians played cricket." After the AP broke the story in 2011, civil rights groups pressured the city to end the program, which never generated a single crime lead. Arab-American groups complained that the only thing it accomplished was to sow distrust between its members and police. The program had been largely inactive since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office this year, and today he announced that it was done for good. “Our administration has promised the people of New York a police force that keeps our city safe, but that is also respectful and fair,” said the mayor. Two federal lawsuits against the city over the surveillance remain in the works.

In terms of getting the pipeline built, the vote doesn't mean much, observes the New York Times. But in terms of the Senate runoff in Louisiana, it looms large. The House measure approved today (as expected) was sponsored by Republican Bill Cassidy, who faces Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu in that Dec. 6 runoff, reports the Washington Post. Both favor the pipeline and are trying to impress the voters back home. Landrieu's test comes Tuesday, when the Senate votes. If she can get 60 votes to avoid a filibuster, the measure goes straight to President Obama's desk. As of now, it's uncertain whether she'll succeed, and even if she does, President Obama seems all but certain to veto it, reports Politico. The Hill agrees, citing Obama's "strong signals" that he wants to wait for a federal review to be completed. It adds that a veto "could deal a blow to Landrieu's chances in the runoff." For the record, the House vote was 252-161, with 31 Democrats joining Republicans. Every Republican voted in favor, except for libertarian-leaning Justin Amash of Michigan.

This time, it was pictures of Reeva Steenkamp's head after she was shot that prompted the vomiting, the BBC reports. Police commander Schoombie van Rensburg described his arrival at the athlete's house following Steenkamp's death, the Telegraph reports. With paramedics on the scene and Steenkamp declared dead, "the body was covered with towels and black bags," van Rensburg said. Pistorius, who was in the kitchen, "was very emotional at that stage, and then I asked him what happened. He didn't answer. He was in tears." Van Rensburg added that Carice Stander, the daughter of the property manager, said Pistorius had called her and her father for help taking Steenkamp to the hospital. Stander and Pistorius had used the bags and towels to stop the blood, she said. The commander described following "the trail of blood up the stairs," where the bathroom door was locked. Photos showed a cricket bat and still-cocked gun on the scene, CNN reports.

In a recent interview with the Daily Mail's Event Magazine, Wood, the other hard-living, hard-partying guitarist in the Rolling Stones, says he refused chemotherapy as a treatment option because he wanted to keep his mane intact. "'I wasn't going to lose my hair," Wood says. "This hair wasn't going anywhere." Doctors discovered the cancerous lesion in Wood's lung in May as part of a routine checkup before the Rolling Stones tour this fall. Wood says he chain-smoked for 50 years but gave up cigarettes last year, before the birth of his twin daughters. After doctors discovered the cancer, Wood underwent a week of tests to determine if it had spread to his lymph nodes or anywhere else in his body. The guitarist says he made up his mind then that if it had, he wouldn't put himself through chemotherapy. "I wasn't going to use that bayonet in my body," he says. When doctors determined the cancer hadn't spread, Wood immediately underwent surgery to have it removed. Wood, who says he drank, smoked, and did cocaine and heroin throughout his career, is cancer-free now but has to go for checkups every three months. The Rolling Stones kick off their 14-date "No Filter" tour Sept. 9 in Hamburg, Germany.

"All between the houses you could see people fleeing with items looted from the patients," an official tells the AP. Now, he said, all 50,000 people living in West Point, the biggest slum in Monrovia, face the threat of infection. Stomach-churning detail: A neighbor said the stolen items, like sheets and mattresses, were stained with blood, vomit, and excrement. So why the break-in, in a country that's already struggling to contain Ebola? Reports vary, but the people were likely unhappy about having the center in their area, didn't like patients being brought in from other neighborhoods, or wanted the center closed because they consider Ebola a hoax, the BBC reports. "This is one of the stupidest things I have ever seen in my life," said a police officer. Ebola has already killed 1,145 people in West Africa, 413 of them in Liberia.

The 1,500-horsepower truck "drove into a crowd of spectators" in what officials call "a terrible accident." Eighteen people were reported injured, and five more are in critical condition in the hospital. Police say the driver, who failed to brake after driving over a series of cars, has been arrested, Reuters reports. In video of the accident, which contains disturbing images, the truck revs up after performing the stunt, the AP reports. It turns—suddenly, as the BBC notes—and plows through a guardrail. An organizer tells local news that he thinks the truck had a brake failure or its gas pedal got jammed. The crowd was at a safe distance behind a fence, he says. The event occurred in the small town of Haaksbergen, nltimes.nl reports. "A lovely, festive afternoon ended in drama,” says a local official. "This is a disaster for Haaksbergen."

Umm Sayyaf, a 25-year-old Iraqi woman captured in the raid that killed Abu Sayyaf, is accused of taking part in the kidnapping of Mueller, who was "owned" and sexually abused by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, NBC News reports. Federal prosecutors filed charges Monday against Sayyaf, who was transferred to Iraqi Kurdish custody a few months after her capture and is currently in prison in Iraq. Sayyaf has been charged with providing support to ISIS, which authorities say contributed to Mueller's death in ISIS custody. According to court papers, Sayyaf and her husband sold and traded women to ISIS fighters, and she was in charge of the captives when her husband was away. The court papers state that Sayyaf threatened to kill Mueller and two Yazidi women she was being held with, calling them "infidels" and showing them gruesome ISIS propaganda videos. Mueller died a year ago, and the Guardian reports that the court papers offer new details about her captivity. The 26-year-old was captured by ISIS fighters in August 2013, on her second day in Syria, and was kept in prison until September 2014, when she was turned over to the Sayyafs, according to federal investigators.

A group called the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan recently registered with the US Federal Election Commission as a super PAC, and while Ryan's press secretary initially only said the speaker was "flattered but not interested," his team is now taking things further. On Thursday, Ryan's political operation is sending the group a cease-and-desist letter, Reuters reports. The Committee's intent was to convince Ryan to jump into the presidential race, not a surprising mission considering how often Ryan's name has been mentioned by establishment Republicans seeking an alternative to Donald Trump. The group has been trying to get a million signatures on its online petition to draft Ryan into the race. The cease-and-desist letter tells the organization to stop giving any indication it is raising funds to assist with a hypothetical Ryan campaign, and says, "We believe the actions of your organization are not in compliance with federal law and may constitute fraudulent solicitation of funds." It was sent to the group's treasurer, but a spokesperson for the group tells Reuters it has not yet been received. "The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan is simply a patriotic effort to save our party and save our country," he adds.

In Atlantic City, officials said they will bus all 30,000 residents to mainland schools and shelters starting at noon tomorrow. "Everyone’s saying, 'This is crap, it isn’t going to happen. The weathermen always get it wrong, so I’m just going to hang out here,'" Christie said. "Please don’t, OK? We have to be prepared for the worst here." You can follow Sandy's progress here.

Telling his story to Mel Magazine, Dave says: "It hit, and I turned the 10 grand into 20. That started my bankroll. I dropped out of school the next day and began betting on sports for a living." That high tolerance for risk is what led Vegas Dave to his current business of placing big bets on longshot sports results—and business is booming. In 2015, he won $2.5 million after betting $140,000 on the Kansas City Royals to win the World Series, a story that was enthusiastically reported in the local Las Vegas Sun. He placed the bet one week into the season, at 30-1 odds, and the payout is the "largest futures bet win in sports gambling history," Mel Magazine notes. Oancea had to spread the bet around to 15 different Las Vegas casinos, because after winning big with sports futures bets before, no casino would allow him to place such a large bet in one go. He's banned from Westgate, Vegas' biggest sports book, and the MGM Grand, and he's limited at several other casinos. "Vegas loves losers but hates winners," he says. Dave believes his win will likely never be replicated in sports betting, because no one else puts down so much money at such long odds. He does lose sometimes—for instance, his World Series pick this year was the Texas Rangers, who were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs—but he points out that even in that case, he's up overall on the Rangers this season, because he won a million bucks on a $300,000 bet that they would win their division.

The Oct. 8 release date is already more than two years behind schedule, a delay caused by production problems that apparently have not abated. Writing for the New Yorker, David Wolman reports that the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has hit yet another snag, per a memo from the bureau. The country has just two currency-printing facilities, and the Washington, DC, location has had a "mashing" issue, in which the application of too much ink led to what the New Yorker likens to a kid painting outside the lines. The affected bills are "clearly unacceptable" and internal quality checks apparently missed that. They were delivered to the Fed interspersed with ones that were printed just fine, and now the Fed is sending back some 30 million of them—and won't take any more from the DC location for now. In the meantime, bureau director Larry Felix has, with an eye on Oct. 8, asked the Fort Worth, Texas, facility to step things up. The Atlantic Wire does the math and calculates it that it's a $3.79 million blunder: The bills reportedly cost 12 cents apiece to produce (that's about $3.78 million), and it tacks on another $12,000 for destroying them. But Wolman sees "a possible greater cost," likening the situation to that of "a magician getting caught unloading a crate of bunnies from the back of his truck. It threatens to injure the aura—the almightiness—of the dollar." Click for more on the coming (fingers crossed) bills.

His tweet Monday came after many had called on him to address the Friday stabbing, and some were calling it a "belated" response. "The violent attacks in Portland on Friday are unacceptable," he wrote. "The victims were standing up to hate and intolerance. Our prayers are w/ them." As Talking Points Memo notes, the tweet came from the official @POTUS account, not the @realDonaldTrump account Trump typically tweets from.

Graham fretted that the president's plan didn't fall within the range of recommendations from military advisers, reports Politico, calling it "the Obama-Biden strategy." John Cornyn on invoking 14th Amendment to raise debt ceiling: That's "crazy talk. It is not acceptable for Congress and the president not to do their job and say basically the president has the authority to do this by himself." John McCain says GOP might be OK with "revenue raisers:" "Jon Kyl was in negotiations with the vice president and he said there were certain revenue raisers in other areas that perhaps we could work on," McCain said, but wouldn't say what those might be when pressed. McCain on Moammar Gadhafi: He still poses a "direct threat." He's committed acts of terror, and he is committing more of those if he's able to remain in power." Further, "This thing could've been over a long time ago if we had acted decisively with the use of American air power."

In a tweet, Trump thanked Kim for the "nice letter" and for keeping his promise of returning what's believed to be the remains of US soldiers who fought in the Korean War, which arrived in Hawaii on Wednesday, per the AP. "I look forward to seeing you soon!" he added. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders didn't comment on when the two leaders might meet again, but she said Kim's letter spoke of "advancing the commitments made" at their June summit, spoofed in a K-pop artist's latest music video, per CNN.

Singer Jim Peterik tells Billboard that he was "surprised and dismayed at the misuse" of the Rocky III anthem, which was played as Mike Huckabee joined Davis for a rally after her release yesterday. "The song has motivated thousands through the years to reach beyond their limits," Peterik said in a statement. "Its use for the release of Kim Davis does not support my views or my politics. I have contacted my publishers to make sure this usage is stopped immediately." Guitarist Frankie Sullivan agreed, saying in a Facebook post that he hadn't given Davis permission to use the song—and he "would not grant her the rights to use Charmin!" Sullivan told Huckabee that he's not "The Donald" but he "can do better than that," reports the Washington Post, which takes a look at the creation and history of the song. Davis, meanwhile, plans to return to work this week, but a federal judge's order says she'll go straight back to jail if she tries to block the granting of marriage licenses for same-sex couples, reports CNN, which notes that Huckabee has volunteered to go to jail in her place. (When Newt Gingrich used "Eye of the Tiger" in 2012, Survivor members not only sued him, they violated his copyright.)

Police in San Bruno, California, arrested Aleen Lam, 72, and Virginia Chan Pon, 65, after officers found 800 pot plants and a bypass to steal electricity from PG&E in the women's house, reports AP. The senior duo faces a slew of related charges. "I have never seen or heard of women in their 60s and 70s running a grow house," District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe tells the San Francisco Chronicle. "I certainly hope it is aberrational rather than a trend. I suppose profiteering in illegal enterprises crosses all the generations."

Police officers then arrive on the scene quickly—and begin kicking him before dragging him away from the flames. The officers apparently thought the man was the same one they had been pursuing in a car chase, but it turns out he was a second driver, an innocent victim who got caught up in the chase. The driver police were pursuing has been identified as 48-year-old Leo Pinkston, and he crashed his car into a utility pole while trying to elude cops after fleeing from a traffic stop. That started a fire that engulfed the vehicle of the second man, now in the hospital with severe burns. "Our investigators have reviewed the video and we believe with certainty that this man is the bystander from West New York who suffered burns, not Leo Pinkston," a spokesman for the Hudson County prosecutor's office tells NBC New York. Friends say the second driver, who has been identified only as a 28-year-old man, had been driving home after work when the accident happened. "This is unacceptable," tweeted Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop. "We're IDing officers. We'll pursue termination + criminal charges as appropriate." He separately said "the entire pursuit that was previous to that fiery crash had questionable judgment calls from the officers." Pinkston, also hospitalized, faces charges of aggravated assault and eluding.

A lot if you're an incumbent candidate running for national office, and perhaps even more if you're a challenger who happens to share the same name as that incumbent. Such is the case for Ron M. Estes, who is running in Kansas' 4th congressional district against, you guessed it, another Ron Estes—GOP Rep. Ron G. Estes to be precise. Per KMUW, the longshot candidate says he is banking not on his name, but on his fellow south-central Kansans' desire for change in the district served not long ago by current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Candidate Estes says he believes he would have chosen to run against Congressman Estes in the GOP primary even if they had different names, but onlookers might find it hard to shake the feeling the name really does help. Candidate Estes has spent just $2,000 on his campaign and doesn't plan to spend any more, he tells Kansas.com. “We knew we couldn’t out-raise the current incumbent,so we’ve been a grass-roots campaign over social media, other things." Those "other things" aside, the challenger's track record includes 40 years at Boeing, during which he spent time on the aerospace giant's International Space Station project. He's hoping his high-level management experience will help him blaze a trail to Washington against the other Estes, the former state treasurer who took over for Pompeo. State officials recently ruled that the incumbent will be distinguished from his opponent by being listed as "Rep. Ron Estes" on the primary ballot Aug. 7.

Monsanto says Bowman, who has been using Monsanto's soybean seeds happily for years, is infringing its patents when he plants a second crop of soybeans each year. The breakdown, courtesy of NPR: Bowman has to sign a standard agreement when he buys Monsanto seeds for his spring crop, stating he won't save any of his harvest to replant the following year. But since his second crop is riskier, he decided to use cheaper seeds for that crop. Starting in 1999, he bought soybeans from a grain elevator. Local farmers drop off their harvest there, and it's sold as "outbound grain," not seed. But since most farmers use Monsanto's Roundup Ready soybean seeds (they're resistant to widely-used weed killer Roundup) nowadays, the beans he bought still included the Roundup Ready gene. Bowman didn't believe Monsanto still had control over these beans; plus, he was getting a variety of different beans, not just Monsanto's, so "I couldn't imagine that they'd give a rat's behind," he explains. But Monsanto sued, and Bowman was ordered to pay the company $84,000 for patent infringement. "He wanted to use our technology without paying for it," says a Monsanto lawyer. Bowman appealed, and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. His lawyers say patent law dictates that once you buy something covered by a patent, you own it and can use it for "ordinary pursuits of life." But Monsanto says this "patent exhaustion" principle doesn't mean Bowman can, effectively, make copies of Monsanto's product. Time puts it this way: Does a patent on a living thing extend to that thing's progeny? The biotechnology and computer software industries are on Monsanto's side, because "patent exhaustion" could hurt them in a similar way. Twenty years ago it was easy to find cheap "public" seeds, but nowadays almost all seeds are patented and thus more expensive, even at small seed companies—and Bowman's case could really shake things up.

The Book of Magical Charms, a handwritten manuscript penned by two unknown Brits in the 1600s, is shelved at Chicago's Newberry Library, along with two similar books, Quartz reports. The charms manual includes everyday tips and remedies, including how to alleviate menstrual cramps, soothe a toothache (use a dead man's tooth, obviously), and craft a super-strong key. It also enters "um … OK" territory, including details on how to chat with spirits and the ominous-sounding "activate the Seal of Solomon." Of the 522 pages contained in the three books, about 350 have been at least partially transcribed, a library rep told Chicagoist last week—and the library wants the public to get in on the act and help transcribe and translate the remainder. Those eager to further elucidate the texts can access The Book of Magical Charms online, as well as the other two tomes. "You don't need a PhD to transcribe," project coordinator Christopher Fletcher tells Smithsonian.com, with Atlas Obscura noting the process is "much like updating a Wikipedia page." Fletcher notes the book's survival is remarkable, as both the Protestant and Catholic churches at the time did everything they could to destroy magic-heavy manuscripts like this. Not everyone thinks the library's call for armchair transcribers is a smart move: "NO / BAD IDEA / NO / HAVE THESE PEOPLE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE HORROR MOVIE," one commenter tweets.

Things began an hour behind schedule, Zuckerberg showed up late to the Q&A (CNBC's explanation: He was in the bathroom), the presentation featured a video that many potential investors had previously viewed online, and the audience was only given enough time to ask eight questions, reports the Washington Post. (Reuters reports it was actually just five.) One of them was about Facebook's purchase of Instagram, which Zuckerberg defended and said he would do again, noting that Instagram's user data passed a "tipping point" that signaled it would grow much larger. One other detail of note: Security was apparently pretty extreme. Would-be investors had to show several forms of ID and be cross-checked against a list of attendees.

The president, sharing a stage with Michelle, shed a few tears as he reminisced about his 2008 campaign and didn't mention Mitt Romney once in his 29-minute speech, Politico reports. "I’ve come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote," he said. "I came back to ask you to help us finish what we started. Because this is where our movement for change began, right here." Mitt Romney, meanwhile, went to New Hampshire for his last rally before the polls opened, the Boston Globe reports. It was also to have been the final one of his campaign but his staff announced he would return to Ohio and Pennsylvania for events after voting today in Massachusetts. "This is a special moment for Ann and me, because this is where our campaign began," he said after receiving a minutes-long standing ovation from the crowd. "And then your primary vote put me on the path to win the Republican nomination. And tomorrow, your votes and your work right here in New Hampshire will help me become the next president of the United States."

RIM's problem is that the BlackBerry is too good at its job—its proprietary encryption is beyond the cryptopgraphic abilities of many governments. This gives concern both to open governments nervous that terrorists could use the devices to communicate securely and those with less noble reasons for eavesdropping on their citizens.

She eventually rammed the suspect's vehicle with her own. A suspect is in custody, and he matches the description of an assailant in a previous sexual assault on another local girl, reports the Albuquerque Journal. The tale began unfolding Wednesday evening, when witnesses saw a man force a 5-year-old girl into his car and drive off, reports NPR. Those witnesses ran to the girl's home and told her mother, who immediately got into her car and started chasing. What she didn't know is that the abductor pushed her daughter out of the car after about a block, apparently rattled by people shouting at him. (The girl is fine.) The mom, talking to police by phone the whole time, eventually rammed the man's car after seven miles, and he escaped on foot. Police today arrested David Jesus Hernandez, 31, on kidnapping and abuse charges. A young girl from the same apartment complex was kidnapped and assaulted last week before escaping, and police say Hernandez matches the description of that assailant.

Former University of Colorado student Austin James Wilkerson, 22, was spared a sentence in state prison Wednesday after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting an intoxicated female student after a St. Patrick's Day party in 2014, the Guardian reports. Instead, Wilkerson—who told the freshman student's friends that he was going to look after her—will be on probation for 20 years to life and will serve two years in the county jail under a work-release program that will allow him to leave jail for school or work every day. Prosecutors—who said Wilkerson "raped a helpless young woman after duping the people around her into believing he was going to care for her"—wanted prison, but the judge used his discretion to give him a sentence lighter than the four to 12 years in state prison the charge usually carries, the Daily Camera reports. His victim told the court that she still suffers from nightmares and panic attacks. "Worst of all is the victim blaming," she said. "'If I hadn't been drunk, this wouldn't have happened. If I hadn't gotten separated, this wouldn't have happened.' Yet it was excusable for him to rape me because he was drunk?" She implored the the judge to "have as much mercy for the rapist as he did for me that night." (Read the statement by the victim in the Brock Turner case here.)

The 25-year-old suspect, Alek Minassian, was charged Tuesday with first degree murder in the deaths of 10 pedestrians he mowed down in the rented van he sent careening along the busy walkway. Fourteen others were injured. Toronto Police Services Det. Sgt. Graham Gibson told a news conference that those killed and injured were "predominantly" women, though he declined to discuss a possible motive, the AP reports. Authorities have not yet released a list of victims. Those known to have been killed include a 30-year-old woman from Toronto, Anne Marie D'Amico, who was active in volunteer work, as well as a female student at Seneca College, which Minassian also attended. A Jordanian citizen and two South Koreans were also among those killed. (The CBC has much more on D'Amico as well as another victim identified by her family.) The gender issue arose because of what police called a "cryptic" Facebook message posted by Minassian just before the incident that suggested he was part of an online community angry over their inability to form relationships with women. The now-deleted post saluted Elliot Rodger, a community college student who killed six people and wounded 13 in shooting and stabbing attacks near the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2014. Calling Rodger "the Supreme Gentleman," the Facebook post declared: "The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys!" Rodger had used the term "incel"—for involuntarily celibate—in online posts raging at women for rejecting him romantically. Like-minded people in internet forums sometimes use "Chad" and "Stacy" as dismissive slang for men and women with more robust sex lives. The anti-women sentiment recalled the 1989 massacre at the Ecole Polytechnique, an engineering college in Montreal, when 25-year-old Marc Lepine entered a classroom, separated the men from the women, told the men to leave and opened fire, killing 14 women before killing himself. In a suicide note, he blamed feminists for ruining his life. Since then, there have been sporadic mass shootings in Canada, but none with a higher death toll.

Police responded to a domestic violence call Wednesday morning in Bankers Hill, where they say they were shot at by a man with a high-powered rifle. The suspect holed up in an apartment building—which lies in the flight path of incoming flights, though not departing ones, per the AP—and exchanged fire with police. The AP reports the suspect walked out and surrendered peacefully after a five-hour standoff. No one was hurt in the incident, and flights resumed Wednesday afternoon.

Or at least that's how things roll in Australia, where a crazy case managed to reach the nation's highest court, reports Bloomberg. It started in 2007, when a 30-something woman got hit in the face by a falling light fixture during a moment of passion with her lover in a motel room. Because her employer had booked the room, she filed for benefits and set off the legal fight. Though a federal court ruled in her favor, Australia's High Court decreed today that the woman is out of luck, reports the Australian. “The relevant question is: Did the employer induce or encourage the employee to engage in that activity?" said the court decision. “The majority held that the answer to that question was 'no.'" The woman needed treatment at the hospital for injuries to her face, notes ABC of Australia, and she also claimed post-traumatic stress disorder.

The office ruled that the 55-year-old took her own life by hanging inside her apartment on Park Avenue. The confirmation comes after husband Andy Spade revealed that his wife had been battling depression and anxiety for years, though Andy Spade said that he'd spoken to her the night before her death and that she had "sounded happy." Andy Spade emerged in public Thursday wearing a cartoon mouse mask in an apparent attempt to avoid being photographed, notes the New York Post. Her father: Spade's dad, Frank Brosnahan, tells the Kansas City Star that he spoke to his daughter Monday evening, the night before her suicide, and that "she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges" for her 13-year-old daughter. He knew of his daughter's problems, adding, "She'd been taking some pills, which I advised her not to take." His wish: Brosnahan also said his daughter would be pleased if her death prompted a serious discussion of depression. "One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that," he said. "If that helped anybody avoid anything—fine, she'd be delighted."

The Hill reports fans of the president elect are ordering drinks at Starbucks and giving their names as "Trump" so baristas have to write "Trump" on their cups and yell it out. The movement took off Friday, with more than 27,000 tweets featuring the hashtag #TrumpCup, CNN reports. "Haven't been to @Starbucks in eons, but I have an urge to get a #TrumpCup," one man tweets. Starbucks addressed the protest in a statement: "Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition." The flames of #TrumpCup were fanned this week when a customer at a Florida Starbucks claimed his drink was taking too long due to "anti-white discrimination." Trump supporters are also cranky about Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz endorsing Hillary Clinton, as well as Starbucks' use of a "holiday" cup instead of a "Christmas" cup. But some people are questioning the logic of protesting a business by buying its products—an unorthodox choice to be sure. "Wow, the irony of millions of Trump supporters going to Starbucks and buying coffee to punish Starbucks. Unbelievable," one Twitter user writes.

Ryan was a 20-year-old student riding the first car of a train in London on July 7, 2005, when her roommate got off at King's Cross station. She hopped out the door, gave him a hug, and turned back to find the car full. She found a spot on the second car, not knowing that a man with a bomb was now in the space she had just occupied. Seconds later, between King's Cross and Russell Square, there was "a huge bang," Ryan tells the BBC. "The train screeched to a halt and a woman fell on me. It was like time stood still." As silence fell, Ryan began to hear "the hideous things next door," the quieting whimpers, "but I couldn't get in to help." Twenty-six people died in the first car, along with 26 others in four coordinated bomb attacks across London in what are now known as the 7/7 attacks—the worst terrorist act in Britain since 1988. On today's 10th anniversary, citizens stood in silence at 11:30am local time, remembering the three bombings on London's Tube and one on a bus in Tavistock Square. Commuters are sharing tributes on Twitter using the hashtag #WalkTogether, reports the Guardian. Prime Minister David Cameron, London mayor Boris Johnson, and Prince Andrew were among those to gather for a memorial service at St. Paul's Cathedral, along with survivors and relatives of victims. Elsewhere, people gathered at the key bombing sites. In addition to the 52 dead, 700 were injured and some 4,000 were affected by the blasts, per the Telegraph. Hundreds, if not thousands, suffered mental health problems as a result, including Ryan, who was diagnosed with PTSD two years ago. She witnessed terror, but "on that day on the train, I didn't see one selfish person," she says. "It was at once the awful side of humanity, but also the magical side."

When the polls closed at 8pm ET, CNN and AP immediately called the race for Clinton, who continues her sweep of the Deep South as she rides a continuing wave of support from black voters. The Republican race took longer, but CNN called it for Trump about a half-hour after the polls closed. With most of the vote in, Ted Cruz handily took second, with John Kasich and Marco Rubio each winning less than 10% of the vote. Up for grabs were 40 GOP delegates and 36 Democratic delegates; they'll be proportionally awarded. Elsewhere: Idaho: With 32 delegates at stake and 74% of the vote in, NBC was projecting Cruz as the winner with 44% of the vote followed by Trump with 28%. Marco Rubio, in what may be his best showing of the night, is third with 17%. Hawaii: Results still to come in the Republican-only contest, where 19 delegates are at stake.

Sam Hemming, a law school graduate of North Wales' Bangor University, was being driven home to Hereford by her boyfriend, Tom Curtis, in July when they got into an accident, per the Mirror: The car flipped, and while Curtis wasn't badly hurt, Hemming was left with broken neck bones, a fractured arm, and severe head injuries, leading doctors to place her in a medically induced coma, the Sun notes. After 19 days, the doctors said hope was gone, and Hemming's family gathered to say their goodbyes. Doctors said they'd switch her life support off and on three times before turning it off for good, just to make sure there was no brain activity—and as they prepared to switch it off for the final time, a medic brushed against her big toe with an icy-cold wipe and her toe wiggled. Doctors gave her a tracheotomy, and a few days later when they turned the life support off again, she could breathe on her own. The second part of Hemming's story: Doctors didn't think she'd ever walk or talk again, though now she's doing both as she recuperates at her parents' home. Even though Hemming suffers from PTSD and has memory loss, doctors are hopeful they can keep boosting her brain function, per the Hereford Times. "When I look at the pictures of me in the coma, it seems unreal," Hemming says. "And when I hear that my toe saved me, it's amazing." (A college student in a coma gave his mom a Christmas "miracle.")

Benjamin Morrow, 28, died on March 5 when an explosion tore apart his Beaver Dam home and left his body under the fallen ceiling. An investigator says Morrow's apartment was a "homemade explosives factory" containing explosive materials including a gallon of acetone, a substance used by ISIS in attacks in Manchester, England, and Paris, France, in so-called "Mother of Satan" bombs. "White supremacist material" was also found in Morrow's bedroom, per an unsealed search warrant. But local police don't think that makes Morrow a white supremacist. "I want to make very clear just because Mr. Morrow was in the possession of this material, does not categorize in any particular light," a police lieutenant tells CBS 58. "He could have been an individual that was doing research." Morrow had also stocked up two handguns, three long guns, a ballistic helmet and vest, and 2,000 rounds of ammunition, per the Fond du Lac Reporter. After bomb experts set off explosives in the apartment and then survived an unplanned blast, they opted to retrieve valuables from Morrow's neighbors and burn down the entire apartment building, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Morrow had worked as a scientist in drug development and studied chemistry at Pensacola Christian College in Florida. (His story comes just after the suspected Austin serial bomber blew himself up.)

They had a number of nasty exchanges, including one in which Perry resurrected allegations that Romney hired a lawn service that employed illegals: Perry: "You stood here and did not tell the truth that you had illegals working on your property. The idea you can talk about any of us having an immigration issue is beyond me." Romney: He denied the charges and fired back that Perry favors amnesty and is weak on immigration, which led to a shouting match between the two, notes the New York Times. "This has been a rough couple of debates for Rick," said Romney. "You have a problem with allowing someone to finish speaking." Blaming the contractor: Romney also used this line to explain the lawn controversy: "We went to the company and we said, look, you can't have any illegals working on our property. That's—I'm running for office, for Pete's sake, I can't have illegals." Notes Ben Smith at Politico: "Remarkably, none of his opponents seized on that calculation." RomneyCare: Rick Santorum went after Romney hard on health care in Massachusetts, saying he has "no credibility" to repeal Obama's plan. (Newt Gingrich also followed with a criticism.) "Santorum is making his bid to be the next Romney challenger. At least someone's talking about RomneyCare." Ed Morrissey, Hot Air. Big target: "The attacks by Santorum, in particular, show that the field has come to view Romney as the most formidable frontrunner in the race." Jon Ward, Huffington Post. Cain under fire: He took flak from just about everyone over 9-9-9, especially Michele Bachmann and Santorum, notes AP. "We're talking about major increases in taxes," said Santorum. Cain rejected the criticism, saying the "10-million-word mess" that is the current tax code must go. Bachmann quote: Obama "put us in Libya. He is now putting us in Africa." A number of bloggers, including David Weigel at Slate, reminded her that Libya is in Africa. Gingrich strong: "All year, Republicans have been waiting for Newt Gingrich to truly dominate a debate. Tonight seems like his night. His line ("I'm a hawk. But I'm a cheap hawk.") spawned genuine laughter from the audience, and his fundamental objection to the deficit-cutting panel seemed to resonate as much as anything said tonight." Patrick O'Connor, Wall Street Journal. Ron Paul: "God bless Ron Paul. He actually calls Ronald Reagan on Iran-contra!" Andrew Sullivan, Daily Beast.

The strategy mostly worked, but some high-tech archeology is finally revealing the camp's secrets, reports LiveScience. British archeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls led a team that conducted the first digs at the site in Poland—Treblinka was actually two separate camps—discovering three previously unidentified mass graves and the apparent location of one of the camp's two gas chambers. They found the latter by scanning the ground with lasers to reveal a brick wall and foundation, and Colls says the gas chambers were the camp's only brick buildings. Nearby, the team found tiles stamped with the Star of David, which meshes with eyewitness accounts that the gas chambers were set up to look like bathhouses. "Treblinka had never been looked at since the period after the war," says Colls. "And everybody had assumed that because the history books said it was destroyed, it was." Her team re-interred any remains they found after consulting with Poland's chief rabbi, "and it was heartwarming to see the reverence with which they treated" them, writes Curt Schleier at the Jewish Daily Forward. He got an early look at a show about the findings that airs at 8 Eastern tonight on the Smithsonian Channel. Treblinka: Hitler's Killing Machine is important and "worth watching," he writes, especially as the number of Holocaust survivors dwindles. David Hinckley at the Daily News agrees, though he was a little put off by the reality-show feel of its presentation. (Click to read about the recent arrest of a 93-year-old who worked at Auschwitz.)

The two leaders butted heads over the conflict in Syria, the Washington Post reports. "Our opinions do not coincide," said Putin. "But all of us have the intention to stop the violence in Syria." Obama echoed that, saying "we do have differing perspectives on the problem." While the US has agreed to supply rebel forces with weapons, Russia remains Assad's main weapons supplier; the White House also announced today that it will send another $300 million in aid for Syrian refugees, reports the BBC. The AP notes that Syria will continue to be the hot topic among G8 leaders at a working dinner tonight; Obama is expected to push Britain and France to join the US in arming the rebels. But the real standoff between Obama and Putin happened outside of a meeting room, reports the Sun. According to a source: "Both wanted the gym and Obama’s people requested it first. It could have sparked a bitter battle and ended up a laughable sticking point at the talks—but the Russians backed down." So while Obama worked out in air-conditioned comfort, the notoriously tough Putin went swimming in a chilly nearby lake. Another quirky G8 side note: Putin and Obama are neighbors.

Now the 4-year-old is brain-damaged for life—able to open her eyes but not stand up or talk—after a simple dental visit to secure decaying teeth, the Houston Chronicle reports. "She's constantly moving her arms and having muscle spasms," says her mother, Courissa Clark. "She's agitated a lot. She cries most days." Nevaeh's family is suing the dentist, Bethaniel Jefferson, who apparently used several sedatives and a restraining device called a papoose on the Jan. 7 dental visit in Houston, KHOU reports. The device firmly straps in the head and limbs, making a child stable but helpless. "They made it seem like it was for her safety so she wouldn't fall off the table or put her hands in her mouth," says 23-year-old Clark. Hearing Nevaeh cry two hours later, Clark went in and found her flailing wildly in Jefferson's arms. Yet Jefferson didn't seek emergency medical help for four hours, according to a Texas dental board that swiftly suspended her license and plans to revoke it pending a judge's recommendation, Click2Houston reports. Jefferson—who's been reprimanded twice before over medical miscues—also gave Nevaeh too many drugs for her 30-pound body, says family lawyer Jim Moriarty. "This child was essentially tortured," he adds. (Jefferson hasn't returned calls for comment.) Now dentist Craig Jacobs is warning other parents about the papoose. "If parents are being told to authorize or grant permission to papoose their child, they probably ought to run," says Jacobs. "You cannot allow your child to be held in a restraint device without you personally being present." (Another girl was declared brain-dead after a simple surgery went wrong.)

She also confesses she can't go out with pals anymore for sushi, because "watching my friends eat my friends ruined my appetite." But the video posted for her Happy Hippie Foundation's "Backyard Sessions" isn't without theatrics: she's tickling the keyboards dressed as a unicorn, with a sympathetic-looking stuffed unicorn forlornly watching her performance from a nearby stool. As Bobby Finger writes for Jezebel, "you can easily expect one or two neurons to transmit some kind of low-level 'awww' message" during the song's "earnest" play. Miley's emotional nosedive reaches a head at around 2:55; the video is here. (Miley had a tough time last year dealing with the death of her dog Floyd.)

The White House released years of performance reviews, including one in which Obama said Jackson "continues to inspire confidence with the care he provides to me, my family, and my team," the Washington Post reports. A White House statement released after Trump met privately with Jackson following his remarks Tuesday said the doctor wouldn't be "railroaded" by false accusations, reports the New York Times. But allegations of misconduct, including creating a hostile workplace and drinking on the job, continued to surface Tuesday, with sources telling CNN that an intoxicated Jackson banged on the hotel room door of a female employee during an overseas trip in 2015 until the Secret Service intervened. Jackson's confirmation hearing, originally set for Wednesday, was postponed after members of both parties expressed concern about Jackson's record. Sen. Jon Tester, the senior Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, says credible reports have been received about Jackson being drunk during overseas trips. "He is the primary attendant of the president, the most powerful man in the world," Tester tells the Times. "You don't know when he is going to need you."

Alex's bionic prosthetic limb was made by Limbitless Solutions, a nonprofit run by University of Central Florida students. The group's goal is to 3D-print affordable bionic limbs for kids (its appropriate URL: 3dhope.com), and this one is their first effort, the Washington Post reports. Using something called surface electromyography, electrical signals from the brain are communicated to the bionic arm, causing the hand to open and close. The awesome part: While a prosthetic typically clocks in around $40,000, the Iron Man arm cost less than $350 in materials; the fairly substantial research and development time were donated. The arm itself was actually donated to Alex, who was born without most of his right arm, with team members contributing their "coffee money" to cover the materials cost. "Albert has made it so affordable," says "Tony Stark" in the now-viral video, referring to Limbitless founder Albert Manero. "I'm probably going to start farming out a lot of my tech work to Albert, too. I feel like he could cut the price point down on one of my suits, which right now is, I guess about, I don't know, a billion and a half dollars."

One of the antiquated models on display at the University of Reading's Museum of English Rural Life ended up trapping a rodent and killing it, despite it having no bait and being somewhere around 155 years old, the BBC reports. Per a University of Reading blog post, museum staff got an email last week that read: "There appears to be a dead mouse in this mousetrap … which is not described as being there on the database." It turns out the rodent managed to get past university staff and into the trap, a feat that activated the device's seesaw mechanism and trapped the critter inside. (You can see more on the design here.) "As we don't expect these traps to be working as mousetraps, we don’t tend to check them regularly, hence the fact that the mouse sadly perished," the museum notes. The staff has decided to preserve the mouse—it was "giving off quite a stink … and so was fumigated by our Conservator"—and will be put out for display in the museum's new galleries now under construction. And to combat any cynicism bred by Jimmy Kimmel pranks and other PR stunts, the museum had this to say: "We can categorically deny that we planted the mouse in the trap in order to gain this publicity. Not only does it go against every rule in Conservation and museum ethics, we don't think any of our staff are Machiavellian enough to have pulled it off." Meanwhile, one of the museum's archivists gives a shoutout to the well-constructed implements of yesteryear, noting to the CBC: "Let's pay tribute to the Victorians, and how wonderfully they managed to make things." (Perhaps this man and wife who live like Victorians are onto something after all.)

Heidi Hemmat was an award-winning investigative journalist with a focus on business fraud for KDVR. In February 2015, her investigation led to fraud charges against a local business owner. According to Raw Story, Muhammed Murib of AAAA TV Electronics Repair and Vacuum started harassing and threatening Hemmat. Then it got worse. In a blog post revealing what happened, Hemmat says she got a call from Murib's therapist—under an exception to HIPAA laws that allows health providers to violate patient privacy when the patient "presents a serious and imminent threat of harm." The therapist said Murib was "homicidal" and planned to kill her. Hemmat says her boss at KDVR balked at the cost of providing security for her, saying, "If he was going to kill you, he would have done it by now." In a statement, KDVR denies the "unequivocally false" accusations, saying "we took Heidi's concerns very seriously and provided her with support, security, and an attorney, for which Heidi expressed her appreciation. To be clear, we never denied a request for additional security." Hemmat took out restraining orders against Murib, "but my sense of safety was gone—and the way I viewed my job forever changed," she writes. "I couldn't keep ambushing people who did bad things to other people." And so she quit. Despite the end of her journalism career and fear for her own life, Hemmat says she has found a reason to be thankful in her husband and young children.

Assistant communication studies professor Andrea Quenette has been on paid leave since November, when a group of eight graduate students filed a discrimination complaint after she used the slur in response to a question in class. The university's Office of Institutional Opportunity and Access notified her on Friday that she did not violate the school's nondiscrimination or racial and ethnic harassment policies when she used the word, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. "This word is offensive, but it was used in the context of retelling a factual event that occurred at another campus," Quenette says, summarizing what the university wrote in a letter explaining its conclusion. The discussion occurred on Nov. 12, a day after a heated, campuswide town hall forum on race. Her comment was in response to a student's question about how to best talk about the event and racial issues with other students. After saying that as a white woman she found it difficult to relate to others' challenges, she noted that unlike on other campuses where there had been visible racist acts and assaults, she had not seen the N-word—she used the actual slur—spray-painted on walls at KU. Now the university has recommended that Quenette undergo cultural competency training, re-evaluate orientation curriculum to include more diversity support, and pair up with a faculty member. A black graduate student who complained about the incident said that while Quenette apparently didn't violate school policy, that doesn't mean her comments weren't perceived as racist by those who received them.

The biggest: FBI Chief James Comey told Congress that he sees no evidence to support Trump's claims that President Obama wiretapped him. Plus, Comey confirmed that the FBI is investigating possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign during the election. Also making news: Low numbers: The daily tracking poll at Gallup has Trump's job-approval rating at 37%, his lowest mark so far, and his disapproval rating rose to 58%. It's being chalked up to controversy over his wiretapping comments and opposition to the GOP health care plan, reports CNN. Net worth: Forbes says Trump's net worth has fallen $200 million since he took office to $3.5 billion. That drops him 220 spots to 544 in its ranking of the world's richest people. Trump's decline, however, isn't about politics but about the New York real estate market. Stephen Hawking: The famed physicist said in an interview that he's not sure he'd be welcome in America under Trump because of his opposing views on the environment. See story. Billboard: An anti-Trump billboard in Phoenix is making headlines thanks in part to its dollar-shaped swastikas, per Fox News. Loyalty: The Washington Post has an unflattering front-page story about the White House that says it has installed senior aides in Cabinet departments whose main job is to monitor the loyalty of Trump's secretaries. ProPublica also reported elements of the story here. Presidents Obama, George W. Bush, and Clinton did not use such a system. Happier news: Not all the news was negative, however. The president is going to be a grandfather again—son Eric and his wife, Lara, are expecting their first child. Trump already is a grandfather of eight, per US Weekly.

After a petition to remove Renoir's work "from our national museums" on the White House's website in April failed to gain more than 15 votes and was thus archived for lack of support, Geller's anti-Renoir Instagram account now has more than 4,000 followers and his eight-or-so-person protest outside Boston's Museum of Fine Arts on Monday is getting some publicity—much to the dismay of one Genevieve Renoir, who says she is the painter’s great-great-granddaughter, reports the Guardian. She even took to Instagram to contest Geller's assertion that Renoir sucks at painting, saying with a smattering of emojis that the free market has spoken. On its face, the movement is about aesthetics. One sign at the protest claiming "aesthetic terrorism" said as much. "If you took his word for it, trees would be a collection of disgusting, green squiggly lines and eyeballs would be jet black as if they were colored by sharpies," Geller tells NPR in its three-question interview. "In real life trees are beautiful; Renoir just sucks at painting." But WBUR reports that the self-described political organizer is doing this as more of a hobby to "blow off steam" and that he means it as a joke, albeit "a pointed one." In using phrases such as "God hates Renoir," "empty calories, and "infantile green scribbles that look like crayon," Geller is also posing provocative questions about who sets a museum's standards for what is displayed and what the public should find beautiful or compelling.

Rick and Morty, a popular animated series co-created by Dan Harmon for the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim roster, hasn't put up a new episode since October 2015, when it aired its second-season finale, the Atlantic notes. So fans were giddy with excitement Saturday when the network unexpectedly aired the first show of Season Three—and the episode's final moments had an additional surprise. Per Business Insider, Rick, who plays the mad-scientist title character, revealed his innermost motivations, and they involved a plum sauce the fast-food chain hasn't offered in nearly 20 years. "I want that 'Mulan' McNugget Sauce. ... That's my series arc, Morty," he tells his grandson. "If it takes nine seasons, I want that McNugget Szechuan sauce." What the deranged patriarch referred to is a condiment McDonald's offered as part of a co-branding effort with Disney in 1998 to push its movie Mulan. The special sauce is now making an appearance on eBay—though the listings mostly appear to be Rick and Morty-inspired jokes—and the show's writers even put out a plea on Twitter, asking McDonald's: "You wanna get in on this? Call me." The restaurant account's reply: "McNugga Lubba Dub Dub" (a twist on one of Rick's catchphrase); a top Mickey D's chef also said, "I'll see what I can do." Business Insider notes a live-action version of Mulan is due out in late 2018, so ... the McNugget's in your court now, McDonald's. (The chain is trying its hand at "cleaner" nuggets.)

A sampling: "At her peak, Houston was the golden girl of the music industry," praised Billboard. "She wowed audiences with effortless, powerful, and peerless vocals that were rooted in the black church but made palatable to the masses with a pop sheen." "A light has been dimmed in our music community today," said the president of the Recording Academy, calling Houston "one of the world's greatest pop singers of all time." "First of all, I want to tell you that I love you all," said her ex-husband Bobby Brown, while performing a show in Mississippi hours after Houston's death, according to the AP. "Second, I would like to say, I love you, Whitney. The hardest thing for me to do is to come on this stage." "She was the most beautiful woman I think I ever saw," said Elton John at a Las Vegas concert. "Thank you for giving us your talent, and one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard." "She will never be forgotten as one of the greatest voices to ever grace the earth," tweeted Mariah Carey.

Freestanding smartphone apps are one option, and more structured instruction comes at a price—and sometimes no price at all. The New York Times looks at some of the numerous options. Pay up: Play online games, talk to "modern-day pen pals," and take advantage of speech-recognition software offered by companies such as Rosetta Stone and TellMeMore. Pay for extras: Basic access to Livemocha is free, and Babbel offers one class for no charge.

A new study suggests that the shape of their eggs played a role, reports the BBC. Scientists aren't sure exactly what that role was, but they do know that eggs of survivor birds were shaped differently than eggs of dinosaurs and birds that got wiped out. Among other things, the non-survivor eggs were more elongated and "significantly more symmetrical," says the news service. The difference in shape suggests that the birds themselves differed in physiology, reports phys.org, presumably in ways that gave them an advantage when the mass extinction took place 65 million years ago. One theory is that the differences in shape may have something to do with crucial differences in hatching and nesting behavior. "I suspect modern birds survived the major extinction event because they used contact incubation that's prevalent now," says one researcher from the UK's University of Lincoln. "They built nests and sat on their eggs whereas most of the birds prior to that were burying the eggs like their theropod ancestors, potentially making them more vulnerable."

If you're thinking, "the horror!" then you'll be glad to hear that management for the Japanese rail company has formally apologized for the train's 20-seconds-early departure. "The crew did not sufficiently check the departure time and performed the departure operation," it said in an official statement and "sincere" apology that led to bemusement on the internet. "I once had an Israeli bus driver laugh at me after he closed the door on my hips and drove off with my legs hanging out of the bus. I am so envious of Japan right now," one person tweeted. The BBC reports that it's "rare" for trains in Japan to be off-schedule, and another tweet highlights that fact, noting, "Have been on a train in Japan where I heard an apology for the train running one minute late." The statement notes that there were no official customer complaints lodged about the early departure from a station just north of Tokyo, but apologizes if any customers missed the train by 20 seconds and were forced to wait for the next one—four minutes later, reports Bloomberg. Yahoo News UK notes that Japan's trains are "among the most reliable in the world," offering a mournful comparison to Britain, where "commuters are only too acquainted with the daily frustration of late trains on the way to work." And the New York Daily News notes things aren't much better in that newspaper's fair city, where subway delays collectively add up to 34,900 hours on the average weekday. The Japanese company's apology "is exactly what Japan is about," sums up one Twitter user. (Meanwhile, in NYC's transit department, leaking corpses on the job.)

With every budget, lawmakers are slashing into discretionary spending, but with Social Security and various health entitlement costs rising, government spending is growing anyway. The result: "Governmental competence is being systematically degraded. … We are spending more and getting less." By 2024, current projections show that all spending on non-entitlements will be just 7.4% of GDP—the lowest share since 1940. Cuts are hitting everything from the military (sort of) to medical research to the federal courts. Yet political debates never focus on this dynamic, in part because polls show the public isn't concerned. "Both liberals and conservatives are complicit in this charade," but ironically it's liberals who most refuse to discuss entitlements. Hence another paradox: "The pro-government party in rhetoric has become an anti-government party in practice." Click for Samuelson's full column.

During a Sunday interview on Face the Nation, he reminds Americans they "got what they voted for," noting that Trump's White House is not much different from his unconventional presidential campaign—even if the drama coming out of it is "different from anything we've ever confronted," reports CBS News. "I don't understand why people are that shocked," he said. The Florida senator, who battled Donald Trump for the GOP nomination, did express that the administration would "benefit from some systems in place that perhaps avoid some of the unnecessary friction points that come up on a daily basis." Politico see echoes of Mitch McConnell's Tuesday comment: "We could do with a little less drama from the White House." John Dickerson kicked off the interview by immediately asking about former FBI director James Comey. Rubio's take: "Well, obviously, look, these media reports that are out there raise questions and deserve answers. What did the president say? Did in fact you keep memos? What do those memos say? And why did you write them? And what was your feeling? And the American public deserves to know the answers to that. I think that's fair to the president. I think that's fair to former director Comey. And I think that fair to the country."

Pyongyang has taken its complaint about The Interview all the way to the United Nations, reports Reuters. In the movie, Rogen and Franco play a TV producer and host who land an interview with Kim Jong Un and get hired by the CIA to kill him. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, the North declares that the premise "should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war." (The North used similar language in an earlier diatribe.) Rogen is taking this about as seriously as you might expect: "People don't usually wanna kill me for one of my movies until after they've paid 12 bucks for it," he tweeted a while back. The movie is out in October, notes the Telegraph.

Last week, sources told the AP that the FAA advisory committee had voted to approve the use of smartphones, tablets, e-readers, and other gadgets for takeoff and landing. But a senior Amazon executive on the advisory panel now tells the Wall Street Journal that the new recommendations go even further, clearing the way for "gate to gate use" of devices, regardless of the apps they're running or the wireless transmission mode they're in. Paul Misener, Amazon's VP of global public policy, also says the panel recommended a simple system for airlines to prove that devices and WiFi won't interfere with their planes—one that looks at past tests instead of requiring a host of new ones. If the recommendations are approved, fliers would still have to use on-board WiFi to access the Internet—not due to safety concerns, but because the FCC bans airborne cell service. About 60% of commercial passenger planes are set up for WiFi, though the largest US inflight Internet provider says its service doesn't really work below 10,000 feet—so even though you may soon be allowed to read your Kindle during takeoff, you may not be able to download e-books at the time.

While the party has long celebrated Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson at such dinners, the pair's own slave-owning history is finally taking a toll. Jackson's role in driving Native Americans out of the southeastern US—the "Trail of Tears"—also is a factor. Democrats in Georgia, Connecticut, Missouri, Maine, New Hampshire, and other states have scrapped their Jefferson-Jackson affairs or are considering doing so. In Iowa, a Democratic leader said it's all about making sure the party lives up to the values of "inclusiveness, diversity, and equality." The New York Times also has taken notice: Controversy over the Confederate flag may be generating bigger headlines, its story observes, but the efforts by Democrats "to remove Jefferson and Jackson from their official identity underscore one of the most consequential trends of American politics: Democrats’ shift from a union-powered party organized primarily around economic solidarity to one shaped by racial and sexual identity."

Except he did so anonymously, at least at first. Philip Hillman snapped a photo of the gesture-in-progress from a window at the Charlesmark Hotel and posted it online, helping set off a city-wide hunt for the "Boston Shoveler," reports Mashable. (Even the police got involved.) Boston Magazine solved the mystery this afternoon, identifying Laudani, who works at the Back Bay Social Club. “I only did it to send a message," Laudani tells the magazine. "I love the Boston Marathon and everything it stands for—the finish line doesn’t deserve to be covered in snow.” Laudani is winning praise from all over of the "Boston Strong" variety, though he'd like people to ease off on the "hero" descriptions. ABC News reports that after his bartending shift ended Tuesday, Laudani joined co-workers clearing off the entrance to the bar where they work. Then he moved on to the finish line, returned his shovel to the bar, and headed home unaware of what he had just set off. Laudani ran the marathon officially in 2011 and as a "bandit" in other years and calls the finish line his "favorite place" in Boston. Now, race sponsor Adidas is offering him entry to this year's race, reports ESPN. Meanwhile, more photos have surfaced showing an apparent second shoveler, and Boston sleuths are on the case.

Smith in the Washington Post. Dinesh D’Souza recently argued that “the president inherited political radicalism from his father.” But Obama Sr.—whom Smith knew personally—“was, in fact, an urbane, Western-oriented intellectual” of an only “modestly leftist bent.” Meanwhile, it is clear that D’Souza has misread President Obama’s autobiography, Dreams from My Father. The younger man was inspired by Obama Sr. “as a man of reason, a defender of modernity against tribalism and corruption,” Smith notes. “Conservatives have many reasons to oppose and criticize the president, but caricatures such as D'Souza's contribute nothing to the political dialogue.”

Rusty Dees says that after gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest country music festival, concertgoers tried to take care of each other amid the panic and bloodshed. "It takes the worst of America to also see the best of America. Everybody was helping each other," he tells CNN. Other concertgoers say that as they desperately tried to get out of the gunman's line of fire, strangers tried to pull others to safety and to hold injured people's wounds closed. More: Lawmakers and faith leaders were among those at a vigil outside Las Vegas City Hall on Monday evening, where 59 candles were lit—one for each of the people killed in the rampage, the Las Vegas Sun report. "What has come about is beyond heartbreaking," said Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman. Officials say acts of heroism probably saved scores of lives during the massacre, the AP reports. Rob Ledbetter, a 42-year-old former Army sniper, says his battlefield instincts kicked in and after making his way to safety, he performed first aid on multiple victims with bullet wounds. The New York Times looks at what it calls the "controlled chaos" at trauma centers after victims started flooding in on Sunday, and at the horrific conditions emergency workers faced. "They were exposed to significant trauma, things that are very, very unusual—a lot of deaths, a lot of injury, a lot of hysteria in one place, a lot of tragedy, so quite frankly many of them will probably be dealing with this for the rest of their lives," says deputy fire chief Jeff Buchanan. British Prime Minister Theresa May has praised a group of British soldiers trained in treating battlefield injuries who rushed to help victims. They had been on R&R after training with American troops in California. "Due to their experience, the guys who heard the noise knew instantly it was gunfire," a source tells the Daily Mirror. "Their training immediately kicked in and they rushed to the festival to help." The Los Angeles Times has stories of some of the victims, including a commercial fisherman and a Disneyland worker. Emergency medical technician Travis Phippen carried his injured father to safety despite having been shot in the arm. John Phippen later died from his injuries. "He was my best friend," Travis says. "He never did anything wrong to anybody. He was always kind and gentle. He was the biggest teddy bear I knew." One of the heroes whose stories White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders recounted Monday was Mike McGarry, who jumped on top of his children when the firing started, NBC reports. "They're 20. I'm 53. I lived a good life," he later said. Sanders also mentioned Sonny Melton, a nurse who died saving his wife.

Cain thinks he knows: one of his former political advisers who now works for Rick Perry. Cain tells Forbes that he briefed Curt Anderson about the allegations in 2003 when Cain was in the midst of an unsuccessful run for Senate. Anderson denied it: “I never heard about this story until I read about it in Politico," he said. "I have nothing but good things to say about Herman Cain." A spokesman for the Perry camp also denied the charge and instead suggested that it might be the work of, you guessed it, Mitt Romney, notes the Hill. “By the way, there are real ties between Romney campaign backers and Mr. Cain and the National Restaurant Association,” said Ray Sullivan. (The Romney camp has previously denied planting the story.) In his Forbes interview, Cain said he told Anderson about the "baseless" charges in case his political foes raised it. "I told my wife about this in 1999 and I’ve got nothing to hide,” he added. Click to read about a third woman who has complained about Cain's behavior in the 1990s.

Police say 17-year-old Nabra Hassanen was part of a group of teens who were walking back to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society mosque in Sterling around 3:30am after eating at an IHOP when they were confronted by a motorist, the Washington Post reports. BuzzFeed reports that mosque officials say the man swung a baseball bat at the girls. After running back to the mosque to seek help, the group discovered Nabra was missing, police say. A body believed to be hers was found in a pond a few miles away around 12 hours later. Darwin Martinez Torres, 22, was arrested and charged with murder after police saw him "driving suspiciously" in the area, according to a Fairfax Police press release. Nabra and the other girls, who went out to eat during a break in Ramadan prayers, had been in Muslim dress, though police say they aren't sure if the attack was motivated by bias or a dispute. The mosque "has always welcomed me and so many in northern Virginia like family," Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said Sunday night, condemning the "unspeakable attack." "Words fail at a time like this, so we'll all have to do the best we can to surround them with the love and support they've always shown each of us," he said, per NBC4.

The Week pores through local papers to find six tales of Christmas coming too early this year: It's never too early for eggnog lattes: In Seattle, at least one Starbucks started selling seasonal drinks right after Halloween. It could, however, be too early for Christmas trees: In South Dakota, trees were already being sold this week—will they even make it all the way to Christmas? And really, people will eventually get sick of Christmas music: Especially if, like one Cape Cod radio station is doing, stations start playing it 24/7 even before Thanksgiving.

Jack Tytell, 40, known as the "Jewish Terrorist" in the Israeli press, shot to death a taxi driver and later a shepherd at point-blank range after moving to Israel from the US in 1997. Years later, he sent pipe bombs to a teenager and a professor at Hebrew University, and attacked a police station during a gay pride parade, reports the Jerusalem Post. Tytell claimed to be guided by angels, and his lawyers tried to get him a more lenient term with an insanity defense. The court rejected the strategy, however. Among the reasons: Tytell said he considered killing a Palestinian child but decided against it because it was "not the American way," reports the International Business Times. A judged deemed that evidence that Tytell knew right from wrong.

Rescuers today heard the yells of Kyndall Jack, 18, and found her clinging to the side of a cliff in Cleveland National Forest, reports ABC News. After being airlifted to safety, she was hospitalized with severe dehydration but is expected to recover. Her hiking partner, 19-year-old Nicholas Cendoya, was found disoriented and shoeless last night in thick brush, but he had no idea where Jack was. He, too, is hospitalized but should be out soon. They were both found in dense forest about a half-mile from their parked car, reports the Los Angeles Times.

This appears to be contingent on the president agreeing to sit for an interview. "We said to them, 'If we're going to be interviewed in July, how much time until the report gets issued?'" Giuliani tells the AP. "They said September, which is good for everyone, because no one wants this to drag into the midterms." Giuliani tells the Washington Post that Mueller floated the Sept. 1 deadline "as an incentive that if we do the interview, we can have more control over the termination date." Trump's legal team still has not decided whether he will indeed sit for an interview, and if he refuses to do so, that could result in a subpoena. "And if they subpoena him, there will be litigation. So no timeline on that,” Giuliani said. The obstruction allegations against Trump are just one part of Mueller's wide-ranging inquiry, meaning his work would continue even if the September deal happens, notes the Times. Giuliani told the newspaper the allegations boil down to James Comey's word against the president's. "We want the concentration of this to be on Comey versus the president’s credibility, and I think we win that and people get that." Giuliani's interviews come as the president ramped up his opposition to the "witch hunt" by promising to order the Justice Department to investigate whether the FBI spied on his campaign.

The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges Weinstein raped de la Huerta twice in New York in December 2010, taunting her with phone calls between the two assaults. New York police said a year ago that they were investigating de la Huerta's allegations. No charges have been filed in the case, but Weinstein is charged there with the rape of another woman. In a new allegation, the suit states that the following month Weinstein exposed himself to the actress in a Beverly Hills hotel when she went to confront him. She alleges Weinstein tried to get de la Huerta to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman. About a year after the incidents, de la Huerta was fired from the HBO show Boardwalk Empire, and the lawsuit states she has reason to believe Weinstein was involved. It cites a photo that appeared in the New York Times of Weinstein talking to Martin Scorsese, a director and executive producer on the show, a few weeks before her firing. Weinstein's attorney Ben Brafman in response to the suit pointed out the lack of charges in New York, and said in an emailed statement that de la Huerta's "newly minted version of events including her new California claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination." More than 75 women have accused Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, of wrongdoing. (Click for all the details on de la Huerta's allegations.)

Caitlin Marriott was heard on video yelling, "Mr. President, f--- you!" in the rotunda of the US Capitol on June 19, seconds before President Trump passed by en route to a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan, per USA Today. Though Fox News reports the 21-year-old's "impulsive" act came after she was "egged on" by fellow interns, "we suspended her for a week, and we took away the badge that allows her to travel freely in the Capitol complex, which means that she will be highly restricted for the remainder of her internship," New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan tells the Washington Post. Per Fox, Marriott will work in Hassan's office through August after authorities found she didn't pose a threat to Trump. In a Tuesday statement, Hassan says Marriott's comment "violated the standards of our office about appropriate conduct." But "this behavior shouldn't be equated with the president's destructive and divisive actions, like ripping health-care away from people." She adds Marriott "immediately accepted responsibility for her actions and is facing consequences for them. The president is doing neither." A day earlier, Trump had tweeted an attack on Rep. Maxine Waters over her encouraging voters to push back against members of the Trump administration in public. "I strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don't agree with you," Minority Leader Chuck Schumer added on the Senate floor Tuesday, per CNN. "If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office."

Halper is the largest single donor to the Occupy Wall Street movement, having donated $20,000 to the anti-corporate Adbusters magazine, which launched the protests. The weirdest thing about Halper is not that he’s a retired Wall Street trader who used to vice chair the New York Mercantile Exchange, or that he’s a 1-percenter. No, the weirdest thing about Halper is that in addition his Adbusters donation, he also donated the maximum allowed $2500 to the presidential campaign of corporate favorite Mitt Romney. “We can only imagine what it's like to have enough money to write several-thousand-dollar checks to causes that effectively cancel each other out,” writes Max Read on Gawker. Halper explains his giving to the New York Times as “a little ADD—like me.” He is a longtime donor to Adbusters and friend of the editor in chief, and wrote the check despite “rolling his eyes” at the idea initially, he says. He soon found himself swept up in the excitement and now makes daily visits to Zuccotti Park, which he calls “the coolest place in New York.” “If there’s pain,” he concludes, “it should be shared.”

Tyler Hadley, 17, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder after police acting on an anonymous tip-off arrived at the house and found the bodies, ABC News reports. The party had broken up by the time police arrived, and the teen seemed "nervous and panicky," claiming his parents were out of town, investigators say. Up to 60 teens attended the party, which Hadley apparently advertised on Facebook before killing his parents, reports the Broward Palm-Beach New Times.

But before the ceremony honoring his actions on September 8, 2009, Meyer wanted something else: the chance to have a beer with the president. They did just that on a patio outside the Oval Office yesterday, reports CBS News. During the meeting, Meyer asked the president for advice on how to achieve success. "He said, 'You know, first thing, get an education and he said just take it slow and don't try to make any rash decisions,'" Meyer tells CBS. Meyer, who was injured in the 2009 ambush, also pulled the bodies of dead comrades from the combat zone, NPR notes. He says that it's "really tough" to be recognized for what he calls the worst day of his life. During his ceremony, at his request, Meyer's fallen friends will also be remembered in hometown ceremonies.

Some early reaction to his news conference: Brian Wingfield, Forbes: "The public outcry over the disaster has left the administration little choice but to take ownership of resolving it, but in doing so the White House has also boxed itself into a corner. For every day the disaster and the cleanup efforts continue, the administration is squarely on the hook. ... Until the leak is plugged, expect (public) outrage to grow in proportion to the amount of oil in the Gulf of Mexico." Also, watch those predictions. Remember "Mission Accomplished"? Gus Lubin, Business Insider: Obama says it's been a priority from day one. "But here's the catch. For him to make that claim, Obama is forced to claim authority over the BP response from the start—saying he could have stepped in at any time. That means defending everything BP has done." This won't "go over well with a furious nation" or "Democrats in Congress who have pummeled BP." Chris Cillizza, Washington Post: Obama argued that the US is in control on strategy but needs BP's technological expertise. "It's a nuanced argument to make and a distinction that Obama has to hope average Americans understand."

Per People, Norris was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal adenocarcinoma in September, and that diagnosis has been an eye-opener for the 33-year-old mom from Kansas. In her note, Norris apologizes to her past cancer patients, noting how much pride she had previously taken in her rapport with them: "I really thought I got it ... what it felt like to go through this journey. I didn't," she says. What she didn't understand, more specifically: what it felt like to hear the diagnosis, how difficult the waiting is, how weird it feels to tell other people or to endure the "sad looks," or how tired, confused, guilty, suspicious, and even "crazy" a patient can feel. And she says she didn't realize how important her own role was. "I didn't get how much you hung on to every word I said to you," she says. "I used to tell you that cancer will be just a phase in your life. Just like high school or something … I'm sorry if this made you feel marginalized—it is not a phase." She also notes she didn't understand how tough it is to let others help, something she tells Us she's had to do herself, especially leaning on her husband, Camden, who's taken on more of the duties of caring for their 3-year-old son and 7-month-old daughter. Norris has been undergoing radiation and chemo and will have a follow-up checkup after Christmas. "I just hope that I was still able to give you a little guidance and strength to help you get through your cancer treatment. Even if I didn't get it," she writes. Her full post here.

Far from cyberbullying, the tbh app—short for "to be honest"—is all about "improving the mental health of millions of teens," co-founder Nikita Bier tells Tech Crunch. Only a month after its release, tbh zoomed to No. 1 free app in Apple's App Store. (An Android version is coming soon.) It works by letting users send anonymous compliments like "has the best smile" to their friends and contacts. Unlike other anonymous apps, tbh only allows positive messages. A ninth-grader named Claire tells New York magazine how it works: "You sign in with your first and last name. You select your school, gender, and grade." The app then asks questions such as "who's always nice to talk to?" Four friends' names are given, and you tap on the one that best fits. As such, there is no typing, and tbh sends the messages, preventing trolls from infiltrating. A notification alerts recipients when they get some love. The app saves messages so users can reread them when they need a boost. "We worked backwards from the content we wanted to see, which was nice comments about ourselves," a tbh rep tells Tech Crunch. Maker Midnight Labs did a test run of tbh last month at a Georgia high school, where it was a hit. The company then launched in nine states and NYC, per New York, and within weeks had 2 million daily users. "I thought the tbh app was gonna be lame," one fan tweeted, "but it's honestly so sweet … and that's pretty cool." And, potentially, addictive: Users can only answer up to 12 questions per hour. (An 11-year-old kid made a video to defang cyberbullies.)

Today's decision means that starting Dec. 1, cigarettes will all come in olive green packages dominated by graphic health warnings with images like blinded eyeballs and cancerous mouths, reports Reuters. The brand name will appear only in a small generic font at the bottom of the package. Tobacco companies, which fear the move will inspire similar laws worldwide and wipe billions from the value of their brands, argued that the law would deprive them of copyright, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. "No longer when a smoker pulls out a packet of cigarettes will that packet be a mobile billboard," Australia's attorney general and health minister said in a joint statement. A spokesman for British American Tobacco said the company was disappointed by the ruling and claimed that the only people that will benefit will be organized crime groups selling counterfeit cigarettes, as making all packets nearly identical will also make them easier to copy. Australia's health minister countered that steps will be taken to prevent counterfeiting, like placing alphanumeric codes on authentic packages.

This week in Florida, however, she met that baby girl, now a 69-year-old mother and grandmother, very much alive and working as a massage therapist in Vermont. "I'm not dead," Connie Moultroup laughed as she hugged her mother Monday for the first time ever in a Tampa assisted-living center; FOX 13 has video of their emotional reunion. When an 18-year-old Purinton gave birth to Moultroup in 1949, "I asked to see the baby and they said she died, that's all I remember," the 88-year-old tells NBC News. Yahoo Lifestyle notes she was never given a death certificate, and she never had any other children. But Moultroup hadn't died: She'd actually been adopted, and her adoptive mother died when she was 5, Moultroup's daughter, Bonnie Chase, tells NBC, adding that a stepmom who eventually entered the picture was abusive. "She would fantasize about her [biological] mother rescuing her," Chase says. What finally brought Purinton and Moultroup together: Ancestry.com DNA-testing kits that Chase bought for her mom and herself last Christmas. Chase's results led her to a bunch of cousins, who noted their relation to Purinton. Then the phone call came. "I think I'm your mother," Moultroup recalls Purinton saying. Purinton is now thrilled to discover she not only has a daughter, but that she's a grandmother and great-grandmother, too. "I don't think Santa can outdo this one," Moultroup tells Yahoo. (This mother-daughter phone call came 83 years later.)

The temple of wood and clay, which measures 197 feet by 66 feet, contains lots of animal bones—perhaps the remains of animals sacrificed on the building's eight platforms made of clay. The upper floor, which has five rooms, is "decorated by red paint, which created [a] ceremonial atmosphere," researchers say. They first spotted the temple in 2009 in a 1,200-building settlement that's double the size of the National Mall in Washington, LiveScience notes. That settlement and others like it are associated with what's now known as "Trypillian" culture. And like similar sites, after inhabitants left the settlement behind, it was burned down, the researchers note. In addition to the bones, the temple contained pieces of pottery and the remains of human-like figurines, as well as what appear to be game pieces and golden hair decorations, LiveScience reports with images.

Working girls at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel in Nevada, launched a "Pimpin' for Paul" campaign weeks ago that's getting new attention thanks to a recent CNN segment. "If a client comes into the Bunny Ranch and says 'I'm pimpin' for Paul,' they're gonna have a real good time," says the brothel owner. The prostitutes support Paul because he's OK with legal prostitution, the New York Daily News notes, and they ask clients to donate to Paul.

The French president had to acknowledge his affair with an actress, a growing mess that sent his other girlfriend to the hospital. And now? Manure, and lots of it, dumped in his name outside the French parliament in Paris, reports AFP. "Out with Hollande and the whole political class!" said the message on the protester's tractor-trailer. (BuzzFeed has photos.) It's not clear that the protester had Hollande's affair in mind, but the president nonetheless has the worst popularity ratings "of any leader in modern-day France," notes Reuters. Police arrested the protester before he got all the manure unloaded.

After the video went viral on Monday, resource officer Ben Fields was shifted to administrative duties pending an investigation, the State reports, and the school district says Fields has been told "not to return to any school in the district." A Richland County Sheriff's Department spokesman says the girl, who was still seated when Fields flipped her desk over, was arrested for disturbing the peace. A fellow Spring Valley High School student tells NBC News that the officer was called in after the girl refused a request to leave the classroom. The girl shows no sign of resistance during the video, and in a longer version, Fields can be heard threatening to arrest a student who objected, reports Reuters. A sheriff's office spokesman tells the State that the sheriff has seen the video and "was very disturbed by what he saw." NBC reports that a 2013 lawsuit accused Fields, who is white, of "unfairly and recklessly" targeting "African-American students with allegations of gang membership and criminal gang activity." Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin issued a statement calling the officer's behavior unacceptable and asking for an independent investigation, the State reports.

In fact, this British TV series is the "romantic comedy of the year," he declares. The first season of six half-hour episodes is available, and it follows the story of an American man (Rob Delaney) and an Irish woman (Sharon Horgan) who have a six-day fling that results in Horgan's character getting pregnant and a quick decision to get married. Catastrophe has all the "basic elements" of the rom-com down pat, but it elevates itself by borrowing a page from the best TV shows and placing their predicament in "weird terrain," writes Seitz. "As strange as this might sound, Horgan and Delaney pull off a similar miracle here, by making their main characters a couple who enact the rituals and milestones of a lifelong relationship even though they’ve just met." A review in the New York Times doesn't quite get to "miracle" level, but it's still relatively glowing: Horgan and Delaney "appear comfortable with each other on screen, and by and large they make us care about Sharon and Rob’s far-fetched romance," writes Mike Hale.

In what advisers say will be his only interview, the Minnesota dentist tells the AP and the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he plans to return to his Bloomington dental practice tomorrow because his staff and patients support him and want him back. The 55-year-old says he has been keeping a low profile since killing the famous lion in Zimbabwe and has been disturbed by threats to his wife and adult daughter, but he hasn't been in hiding. "I've been out of the public eye. That doesn't mean I'm in hiding," he says. "I've been among people, family and friends. Location is really not that important." Palmer, who brought a lawyer and a PR consultant to the interview, wouldn't discuss how much he paid for the hunt, but says if he "had known this lion had a name and was important to the country or a study obviously I wouldn't have taken it." He says reports that it was shot 40 hours after he injured it with an arrow are incorrect and he finished Cecil off with another arrow much sooner than that. Zimbabwe says the lion was poached and it wants to extradite Palmer, though his lawyer says neither Zimbabwe nor the US has made a legal claim and he doubts they are going to. Palmer's River Bluff Dental office reopened without him a few weeks ago and, after the killing of a safari guide last month, tweeted that lions are "very dangerous/deadly."

Bono had been “quite angry” after Monday night’s competition show, when he and partner Lacey Schwimmer accused the judges of making “disrespectful” comments about Bono and his weight, according to the Hollywood Reporter. But last night he insisted he is “not leaving the show bitter or angry."

But the guest coming up on her June 18 show may be generating even more attention: conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of Infowars. Given that Jones has suggested, among other things, that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax and that 9/11 was an "inside job," the choice is generating a ton of criticism already. Coverage: Teaser: NBC has released a teaser of the interview, in which Kelly challenges Jones on Sandy Hook in particular and accuses him of a "dodge" in his response. See it here. Typical sentiment: A post at AV Club voices a common sentiment among those criticizing the choice. "She may be calling him out for his claims that the Sandy Hook shooting was a hoax, but she’s still giving him an opportunity to defend that repugnant argument," writes Sam Barsanti. Kelly's defense: She notes that President Trump has praised Jones and wants to give him White House press credentials. "Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light," she tweets. Mother's response: “By making this choice, you grieve our hearts and the memory of our child,” tweets Nelba Marquez-Greene, whose daughter, Ana Grace, was killed in the school shooting. “You have a powerful platform. I encourage you to ‘shine light’ on affirming the losses suffered here- NOT on a person who mocks those losses…. Evil doesn’t need another platform.” Much more: HuffPost rounds up the many critical tweets surfacing about the interview. One in particular catching attention: "My nephew survived Sandy Hook. I am not tolerating this. Will never watch @megynkelly or @NBCNews again if they choose to air this." Jones' reaction: On Friday, Jones posted a video in which he goes after Kelly personally in the wake of their interview, notes Mediaite. "Not feminine. Cold. Robotic. Dead," Jones said. "I felt zero attraction to Megyn Kelly. That’s not an insult to Megyn Kelly. I talked to a lot of other folks that know her. They say, ‘No. It’s the same.’ Because you’re dealing with…sociopath? A psychopath? I don’t know.” 'Performance artist': In his recent child custody case, Jones told the court that he is merely a "performance artist." He lost the case. Morning show: Kelly launches a morning show on NBC in the fall, and she just landed a big-name producer, reports Page Six.

David Moralez says he stopped to chat with his brother Zach after he spotted him working with a state Department of Transportation crew on US 60 on Oct. 18. As they were about to part ways, they noticed a hole in the fence and spotted a car stuck in a mesquite tree 50 feet down a ravine, the AP reports. Joined by a trooper who responded to their 911 call, they followed footprints for around 500 yards until they found the severely dehydrated 53-year-old woman, who had a dislocated shoulder, broken ribs, and a head injury. "I don't know if she could have made it there another night," David Moralez tells NBC News. "She was in pretty rough shape when we found her." Police say the woman told them she lost control of her vehicle on the highway near the town of Wicklenburg on Oct. 12. She spent a few days in the car before climbing out to seek help. She tried to walk to railroad tracks but was too weak to go on. She was airlifted to a hospital. Department of Public Safety Director Col. Frank Milstead says the woman's life was saved due to the group's "outstanding efforts." David Moralez says that growing up on a ranch, he and his brother were taught to always watch out for broken fence line. (This teenager was rescued from his wrecked car after his father hired a helicopter.)

Per Hollywood Life, Sam Sarpong, 40, an ex-Tommy Hilfiger model and former co-host of MTV's Yo Momma reality-TV game show, jumped from Pasadena's Colorado Street Bridge and was pronounced dead by paramedics at 3:52pm, according to a release from the Pasadena Police Department; the LA County coroner ruled Sarpong's death a suicide, with an autopsy to come, Variety reports. Law enforcement had rushed to the bridge Monday morning after a witness spotted Sarpong standing outside the bridge's railing. Police closed off the area under the bridge as well as the bridge itself while they tried to talk him off his perch, but he ultimately jumped into the river underneath the bridge, Deadline reports. Sarpong, who was born in London, moved to LA when he was 11 and eventually started modeling, including a six-year stint with Tommy Hilfiger, as well as Versace, Gucci, and other big names, Variety notes. He nabbed the MTV spot in 2006 and had a slew of other TV credits to his name, including parts on ER, Boston Public, and 24. He'll also be featured in next year's much-hyped American Crime Story: The People v. OJ Simpson on FX. "[Sarpong] had a pure heart and always went out of his way to help others," his rep tells the magazine. "We will all miss him dearly." His MTV co-host also had something to say about the tragic news, CBS Los Angeles reports. "I am so sad & so confused," Wilmer Valderrama posted on Instagram. "Sam did it all, believed in dreaming bigger than anyone around him. … And to everyone in a dark place.. PLEASE, please talk to someone.. Anyone."

The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library confirms—by way of Lincoln's unusual style of writing the letters E and N—that one of the most popular Americans wrote an inscription inside a tattered copy of Types of Mankind, which has sat on a shelf at a small Illinois library for years. The book argues that different races were formed separately and thus African-Americans are not "fellow men," NBC Chicago reports, noting the argument was often used to justify slavery. Lincoln scribbled the name of the book's owner, Clifton Moore, inside the front cover but did not include his signature, the museum says. So did the Great Emancipator buy the arguments he read? "Lincoln was worried that the whole idea that you could segregate one group of people based on some brand-new thinking would just carry on into other realms," a presidential library curator tells CBS Washington. "Everything we know about Lincoln's legal, religious, and scientific thinking tells us he rejected that argument." Though published in 1854, it isn't clear when Lincoln got his hands on the book. Below his inscription, however, is a note from a local attorney attesting to the fact that Lincoln wrote in the book in 1861, after he was elected president but before he left Illinois; some think it's possible he borrowed it to prepare for his presidential campaign. The Vespasian Warner Public Library eventually plans to put the book on display. (In other news, experts think they've identified a mysterious pen pal of Lincoln's.)

The Australian bride, who married Saturday at a country club in southwest Sydney, was nearly hit by an unruly and allegedly quite drunk wedding guest after he got in an argument with other guests, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The 55-year-old apparently jumped into his Mazda 3 around 9:30pm, raced toward two people he narrowly missed, and when someone tried to take his keys from the ignition, reversed at high speed toward another group, this one including the bride. He managed to avoid everyone, and no one was injured. Wedding photographer Warren Donovan tells Australia's ABC News that the guest, believed to be the partner of a relative of the couple, was "well and truly" drunk, but he adds that the couple, while shaken, "sort of went, 'We're not going to let this ruin the night.'" The man was found around midnight on foot, at which point police also confiscated marijuana. He was charged with menacing and dangerous driving, disqualified driving, and possession of a prohibited drug; he's due in court at the end of the month. (This bride-to-be was stabbed after her own bachelorette party.)

(The Star has the details on how the goat's owner spotted his neighbor in the act.) But weirder still is that the goat itself was brought into court for the sentencing. As the Metro puts it, "the female goat watched quietly in the corner of the court room as her attacker was jailed for bestiality."

Kirsten Gillibrand expressing anger at the harassment of women in the military. This time, she was grilling Marines chief Gen. Robert Neller in the wake of the revelation that photos and videos of female Marines, sometimes nude, had been widely shared in online groups. One exchange, via ABC News, sums it up: Gillibrand: "It is a serious problem when we have members of our military denigrating female Marines who will give their life to this country in the way they have, with no response from leadership. So if you're dedicated to fixing the culture of the Marines and all the services, what do you plan to do to hold commanders responsible who fail to get this done?" Neller: "I'm responsible. I'm the commandant. I own this, and we are going to have to, you know, you've heard it before, but we're going to have to change how we see ourselves and how we do—how we treat each other. That's a lame answer, but ma'am, that's the best I can tell you right now. We've got to change, and that's on me." The New York Times, meanwhile, has the story of one of the women victimized. Savannah Cunningham, a 19-year-old in Phoenix, made a nude video for a Marine she was dating in a long-distance relationship, and it surfaced in the online forums. Cunningham wasn't in the military at the time, but, despite the harassment she endured over the video, ships out for basic training next month. “Someone needs to stand up and say this does not represent the values of the Marine Corps,” she tells the newspaper. “If not me, then who?” A story in the Navy Times shows the challenge: It confirms that the scandal is not confined to the Marines, with women from at least a dozen Navy commands also specifically targeted in the online forums, likely by other sailors.

A March 28 ruling by South Africa's Supreme Court, released Monday, rejects Pistorius' request to appeal his 13-year jail sentence for the 2013 murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, handed down in November after prosecutors objected to an initial six-year sentence. "This is the end of the road. There are no other legal options available," a rep for the National Prosecuting Authority tells AFP. Pistorius, 31, will be eligible for parole in 2023 at the earliest, reports Sports Illustrated.

Richard Bull, 32, was apparently using his iPhone in the bath when it slipped into the water and electrocuted him, the Telegraph reports. Coroner Sean Cummings said he plans to write to Apple to warn of the danger. "These seem like innocuous devices, but they can be as dangerous as a hairdryer in a bathroom. They should attach warnings," he told the inquest, per the Guardian. "This was a tragic accident and I have no reason to believe at all that there was anything other than it being completely accidental." Bull, who had used an extension cord from the hallway of his London home to bring the phone into the bath while it charged, suffered burns so severe that when his wife found his body, she thought he had been attacked and called police. The rugby player had been getting ready to meet family members and exchange Christmas presents. "When you are younger you are taught about electricity and the bath, but you don't think about this," his brother Andrew said. "I still find it hard to believe that between the charger plug and the phone would be enough electricity to kill someone." (The NYPD says keeping a phone under your pillow is also a bad idea.)

So now what? Chavez's camp says it's no big deal, arguing that the swearing-in is a mere formality that can be postponed until Chavez is well enough to travel. But the opposition thinks the constitution makes clear that if the incoming president can't be sworn in, the National Assembly leader must form a caretaker government and call new elections. It wants the nation's Supreme Court to settle the dispute. "The Supreme Court has to take a position on what the text of the constitution says," says opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who lost to Chavez in the fall election. "There is no monarchy here, and we aren't in Cuba." The National Assembly leader, for his part, says he has no intention of taking over on Thursday, reports CNN. "When (the opposition) talks about a power vacuum, they are proposing a coup."

The latest development: The New York Times reports that she requested research into billionaire George Soros after he went after Facebook. Sandberg sent an email to the company's communications team requesting the research after Soros called Facebook a "menace to society" at a global forum in January. Sandberg has been downplaying her role in the opposition research conducted on Soros and other Facebook critics ever since an earlier Times report revealed that Facebook had hired a firm called Definers Public Affairs. But the email, which BuzzFeed reports Facebook confirmed, suggests she played a larger role than first acknowledged. A Facebook statement downplayed the significance of the new report, saying Sandberg wanted to know if Soros stood to gain financially from his criticism. “Mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,” the company said. “That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook's stock." Sandberg initially said she was unaware Facebook had hired Definers, then acknowledged that some of its work had shown up on her desk. A spokesman for an anti-Facebook coalition called Freedom From Facebook said Sandberg has lost credibility. "In light of Sandberg’s continuously changing story on the Soros research, there's no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value," said Eddie Vale. He called on Facebook to release all emails about its opposition research. (Mark Zuckerberg says neither he nor Sandberg will be leaving the company anytime soon.)

While amyloid plaques have been found in several species of aging primates, the tau tangles found in people have never been spotted outside of humans—until now. Reporting in the journal Neurobiology of Aging, researchers say they've discovered them in our closest relative, the chimpanzee. Since chimps were declared endangered in the US in 2015, research on them has been dramatically restricted, and invasive research is banned, making MRI scans on aging chimps unlikely. But a new center that obtains the brains of chimps who died at zoos or research centers enabled this study, reports Science. Twenty brains that belonged to chimps who'd died between the ages of 37 and 62 (the latter is about 120 in human years) were analyzed; 13 had amyloid plaques and four of those had tau tangles. Still, chimps don't display severe dementia. "They're missing something," an outside neuropathologist tells Scientific American. It's possible the proteins are folded differently to protect them, which has the potential to inform human treatment. At the very least, they're the only other animal known to display Alzheimer's pathologic signature. (Many people being treated for Alzheimer's may not have it.)

Spain's National Statistical Institute said the economy shrank 0.3% last quarter, following a 0.3% contraction in the fourth quarter of 2011. As bad as that contraction is, it's actually less than the government forecast of 0.4%, reports Bloomberg. But that's little consolation to Spain's jobless, as unemployment rose yet again, now reaching 24.4%, the highest since 1996. Unemployment for people under 25 years old is a brutal 52%. "The figures are terrible for everyone, and terrible for the government. Spain is in a crisis of huge proportions," said Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo. Despite the economic news, Spain's newly elected government says it remains committed to making deep cuts to lower the country's deficit to 5.3% of the GDP from 8.5% last year. "We are implementing a series of reforms that are more positive, necessary, and required than ever," said Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. "Spain needs deep structural change, not makeup."

The art world is buzzing over a French scientist's claims that he discovered a portrait of another woman lurking beneath the top layer of the world's most famous painting—meaning the Mona Lisa as we know her might not be the real her, the BBC reports. Pascal Cotte, who co-founded a Paris-based company that digitizes fine art, has been studying Da Vinci's signature piece for 10 years using a technology called the Layer Amplification Method, or LAM, which involves shining "intense" light onto a painting, then measuring the bounced-back reflections to gauge what's underneath, per Newsweek. And what Cotte says is underneath the surface of the Mona Lisa is an image of a woman looking off to the side (not straight ahead) with different physical characteristics than the model that currently smiles down on crowds at the Louvre. For instance, the hidden portrait shows a woman who boasts a bigger head, nose, and hands, as well as smaller lips, the Telegraph notes. Which means, as an art historian tells the paper, that "it was a portrait [that woman's] husband never received. Instead, Leonardo went on to paint the world's most famous picture over the top." But not everyone's convinced the find is that amazing. An Oxford University art history professor tells the BBC that the newly uncovered model was likely not the start of a completely different painting, but simply an "evolution" of the final Mona Lisa in which Da Vinci kept painting over the previous version until he got the result he wanted. "I am absolutely convinced that the Mona Lisa is Lisa," he says. The Louvre, for its part, is declining comment because it "was not part of the scientific team" that analyzed the painting, per the BBC. (The Telegraph floats a whole bunch of intriguing rumors about the painting.)

Some 562 authors, from Margaret Atwood to Don DeLillo to Ian McEwan, are following tech firms' anti-surveillance push with one of their own: They're calling on the UN to create a global bill of digital rights, the Guardian reports. Current snooping, as revealed by Edward Snowden, makes everyone a suspect, say the authors, who hail from 81 countries and also include Kazuo Ishiguro, Jeffrey Eugenides, Dave Eggers, and Tom Stoppard. Their petition, which doesn't specifically mention the NSA or Britain's GCHQ, says humans have the "fundamental" right to "remain unobserved and unmolested." It notes that "a person under surveillance is no longer free; a society under surveillance is no longer a democracy. To maintain any validity, our democratic rights must apply in virtual as in real space." The authors urge the creation of a digital rights convention that governments would "sign and adhere to." Notes Juli Zeh, a writer behind the effort: "We all have to stand up now, and we as writers do what we can do best: Use the written word to intervene publicly." In agreement? You can sign their petition here.

Yes, even Lindsay Lohan is apparently reminded of Lindsay Lohan when she reads about Bynes' troubles, as evidenced by this tweet from LiLo: "Why did I get put in jail and a nickelodeon star has had NO punishment(s) so far?" Shockingly, we have to agree with La Lohan on this one, although to be fair, Bynes has thus far avoided implication in any jewelry thefts. Lohan aired the sentiment shortly after news broke that Bynes—whose license is suspended—was pulled over yet again yesterday. Her car, at least, got impounded this time, E! reports. Prior to that, Bynes was photographed driving Thursday night with her face covered, which is probably about as safe as it sounds. But she insists she's fine and totally not crazy, TMZ reports. She also denies smoking pot while driving, and says the pipe she was pictured with in her car actually contained tobacco. Which sounds likely.

The agency says the Pavlof Volcano, which is about 600 miles southwest of Anchorage, erupted abruptly at 4:18pm local time. The agency says the eruption also led to tremors on the ground. The USGS has raised the volcano alert level to "Warning" and the aviation warning to "Red," the AP reports. The volcano, which is about 4.4 miles in diameter, has had 40 known eruptions and "is one of the most consistently active volcanoes in the Aleutian arc," the agency says. (A recent study found that while supervolcano eruptions are devastating, it might be possible to outrun them.)

Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton tells the Kansas City Star that his office served Ford, 38, with a protective order—given to Ford at the Excel Industries plant where he worked—that paints a dire picture of Ford's supposed mental state. "He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed," the complainant writes in all caps in the filing. "It's my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!" Walton wouldn't say who the complainant was, simply noting to KWCH that "I can't give you details, but it would be someone he was in a relationship with." The order was apparently placed in response to an incident that was said to have taken place between the complainant (who IDed herself as Ford's live-in girlfriend) and Ford on Feb. 5. In that complaint, the woman alleges she and Ford engaged in a verbal fight that soon turned violent and included Ford pushing and grabbing her and placing her in a "choke hold from behind" until she "couldn't breathe." She reported the alleged attack to police by phone on the 5th. Ford received the order at 3:30pm, and Walton said at a Friday press conference, per the New York Daily News, "He was upset but nothing greater than anybody else that gets served a [protection from abuse order]." Ford then left the factory; the first shots were reported at 4:57pm.

"Now you come out ... from the 'Trump church' in the Republican primary with a big Trump halo," says Mike Murphy on NBC's Meet the Press. "But in the general election, Democrats all hate Trump and among Independents he's mostly upside-down. So what is your magic light sword in the primary becomes an anchor around your neck in the general." Murphy laments that such "all Trump all the time" candidates are commonplace: "It's like the Stalin trials now. If you wore the collectivist tie, you're out of order. It's the new reality of the Republican primary." For more around the dial: The lies: "This has never happened before," says ex-White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, a veteran of Bill Clinton's administration, on CNN's Reliable Sources, per the Hill. "We've had great presidents, we've had terrible presidents, Republicans and Democrats, but we've never had anything like this—where we have a president who is incapable of telling the truth." The narcissism: "Our message is rescue America—and we will rescue America—from the grasp of an unhinged narcissist who is creating ... chaos," says Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, on ABC's This Week, per USA Today.

Of course, Angelina Jolie is perhaps a little bit older than most of us were when we came down with the itchy illness. But she does indeed have it, she reveals in a YouTube video explaining why she is pulling out of the premiere and other events surrounding the release of Unbroken, which she directed, CNN reports. "I will be home, itching, and missing everyone," she says, "and I can't believe it because this film means so much to me. " (Check out a recent picture of Jolie in a very awkward run-in.)

"I think the Russians were in there, but it doesn't mean other people weren't, too," Woolsey tells CNN. "It's often not foolproof to say who it is because it is possible and sometimes easy to hide your tracks. There's lots of tricks." Woolsey, who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations and was CIA director under Bill Clinton, admitted that Trump is an " expert in weaving around" issues like this, and there is a chance that he could just be playing the media with claims to "know things that other people don't know" about the hacking allegations. In other developments: Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, is among Trump staffers warning against "jumping to conclusions" on Russian hacking before a final report is released later this week, calling it "irresponsible." "There is zero evidence that they influenced the election," he told Fox News on Monday. Trump has promised to divulge what he knows about the hacking allegations on Tuesday or Wednesday, reports the New York Times, which notes that he has previously described suggestions Russia tried to sway the election as "ridiculous." Official sources tell CNN that the investigation ordered by the Obama administration has uncovered proof of Moscow's involvement including "digital fingerprints" from specific keyboards that have been traced to the Russian government. Sources tell CBS News that evidence of more attempted Russian cyberattacks has emerged in recent days, after the Obama administration revealed some of the tools used by alleged Russian hacking units. Reuters reports that John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has scheduled a hearing on cyberthreats for Thursday, just two days after the new Congress takes office.

"We are being cautious and careful, but in the context of a very bold effort." Some 600 top industrial plants' emissions will be regulated by the measure; if they can't cut their emissions as required, they'll have to secure pollution allowances from the state or other emitters who have an excess. By a vote of 9 to 1, California’s Air Resource Board approved some 3,000 pages of documentation, following a three-year process that saw testimony from industry execs and environmentalists. “We have led the nation in developing green policies," said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. "And we have seen our green economy grow as a result." See details of the cap-and-trade plan.

The rapper was scheduled to appear at Columbia's Colonial Life Arena with a slew of other acts, including Cardi B and 2 Chainz, as part of the second annual Fall Ball, but he balked at following "standard safety procedures" at a checkpoint, the arena noted in a statement. Instead, he turned around and left, leaving the show to go on without him. "While we regret the artist's decision not to perform, Colonial Life Arena is not willing to bypass its security standards and jeopardize the safety of its patrons, performers, or staff members," the arena statement read. Refunds will start to be doled out Monday "at the point of purchase," the statement notes, per the State.

Keller and Collin Gwaltney went running in a mountainous area near Antonito on the afternoon of July 23, eventually taking different paths as they often did, Gwaltney tells Dateline NBC. "But after two hours passed and he didn't come home, we went out looking," he says, but to no avail. The Conejos County Sheriff's Office suspended its search earlier this month with no leads. Keller's mom, Zoe, says waiting for news about her 19-year-old son has been torturous. "It's just an awful situation not knowing if your loved one is in heaven or in a terrible situation on earth or out in the wilderness," she laments. Officials say the FBI is investigating the disappearance, and have not ruled out foul play. Back in Tennessee, the community is hoping for a miracle. "There have been a lot prayer vigils and fundraisers," Gwaltney says. "Everyone wants him home." A GoFundMe account has been created for the Keller family to help offset the cost of their search, investigation, and $50,000 reward for information leading to Keller's safe return. The teen is 5-foot-7, 160 lbs., with blond hair and hazel eyes. He was wearing red running shorts with reflective strips on the sides and blue running shoes at the time of his disappearance.

Obama’s speech, despite the customarily excessive use of 'I,' 'me,' and 'my,' was workmanlike and wise in its emphasis on continuity of strategy." Josh Marshall, Talking Points Memo: "If something like this went unchallenged Obama's status as the ultimate commander of the American military would pass a threshold level of credibility. And yet ... I'm not sure I thought he had it in him. But he did. I've learned something." Max Boot, Commentary: "If there is one general who can step quickly into the top job in Afghanistan, it is Petraeus. ... And if there is one general who knows how to handle the media and the political process (skills that McChrystal obviously lacked), it is Petraeus." Susan Davis, Wall Street Journal: "Obama may have made a smart tactical move that will shield his nominee from any pushback from congressional Republicans because they like Petraeus. They really, really like him."

Now it's texting and walking," a New Jersey bystander tells NBC New York after he watched a woman tumble head first into a gaping hole in the sidewalk on Thursday. The 67-year-old woman was staring at her phone while walking in Plainfield and failed to see a pair of access doors open in front of her. WPIX reports she fell six feet to where crews were working to repair gas lines. A surveillance camera captured the fall and, later, several firefighters carrying the woman out on a stretcher. She was hospitalized in serious condition. (A NJ lawmaker is trying to make texting and walking illegal.)

Though the film has some great visuals, it drags at times. And critics agree: Don't see it at 48 frames per second. It just looks too real. The film "is solid and acceptable instead of soaring and exceptional, one unnecessarily hampered in its quest to reach the magical heights of the trilogy," writes Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times. "There is just not enough story here to prevent things from getting pokey." On the other hand, with such great source material, "there is only so far wrong you can go." "The comparative playfulness of the novel could have made this Hobbit movie a lot of fun," notes AO Scott in the New York Times. Instead, "Tolkien’s inventive, episodic tale of a modest homebody on a dangerous journey has been turned into an overscale and plodding spectacle." Overscale indeed: We get six chapters of the book in three hours, writes Bob Mondello at NPR. "The filmmakers are reduced to detailing troll recipes and staging a hedgehog rescue." Your opinion of the film all depends on your comparison point, asserts Andrew O'Hehir at Salon. "If you arrive at The Hobbit via the flatulent mediocrity of most contemporary fantasy films and fantasy fiction, it looks pretty damn good," he notes. But if you're comparing it to the earlier films, you see a "sprawling, shambling, full-length prequel to (Peter) Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but not so much to Tolkien's." Meanwhile, Slate offers a different take on 48 frames per second.

The mother, a gunner in the Royal Artillery, had no idea that she was pregnant before the baby arrived, healthy but five weeks premature, the Telegraph reports. A specialist team is on the way from Britain to bring the mother and baby home from the base, which had been attacked just days earlier by Taliban insurgents. Unaware she was pregnant, the soldier passed tough pre-deployment training, including an eight-mile run with a 25-pound backpack, before arriving in Afghanistan in March. "It is bizarre that she didn't feel some side effects of the pregnancy," an Army insider tells the Daily Mail. "But the conditions of deployment, the heat of the Afghan summer, the different hours of working, mean that many soldiers feel a little odd and put it down to the change of environment." The British military does not allow pregnant women to deploy and has sent at least 70 pregnant soldiers home from Afghanistan over the last 10 years.

Now, because of a fish seller in Kuwait, there's another type of eyes to beware: plastic, googly ones.

On the heels of the former VP candidate calling for President Obama's impeachment, 54% of voters say they've heard too much from Palin already and would prefer that she be less outspoken in political debates, according to an NBC News poll. While that balanced out to two-thirds of Democrats, it also included a majority of independents and 40% of Republicans. But Palin shouldn't feel terribly singled out; the poll found that voters would like these guys to shut up, too: Jesse Jackson, 51% Dick Cheney, 45% Newt Gingrich, 43% Al Gore, 40% Bill Clinton, 32% Palin's impeachment zinger has thus far found little support among the GOP, which may also fear it could drive Democrats to the polls in November. John Boehner said yesterday "I disagree" with those calling for Obama's impeachment, the Hill reports. And "while Mr. Obama's abuses of executive power are serious," they don't reach the level of impeachment, a Wall Street Journal op-ed notes. In fact, impeachment "at the current moment would backfire on Republicans" as it plays into the claim from Democrats "that GOP opposition to Mr. Obama is personal."

Lohan was prohibited from driving while working on the movie, as required by the insurance policy taken out by the production company, sources tell TMZ. The insurance company was reluctant to issue the policy in the first place, seeing as how LiLo is not exactly what one would call reliable, so it set a bunch of conditions including banning the accident-prone Lohan from taking to the open road. The production company apparently didn't care that Lindsay was violating the ban by driving anyway … until she crashed, in full view of a production SUV that was following her, sources say. What does this mean for her? The insurance company reportedly hasn't tried to cancel the policy, but the production company is now cracking down on Lindsay's driving privileges. If you've somehow managed to avoid them until now, TMZ has photos of the wrecked Porsche.

"I've always believed life is about embracing the gifts and rising up to meet the challenges," he said in a statement released by ESPN. "We've been presented with another challenge, as I've recently been diagnosed with cancer." Schilling didn't elaborate on the type or severity of the cancer, and ESPN didn't say whether he'd remain on the air next season. In December he was announced as part of the network's Sunday Night Baseball team. "With my incredibly talented medical team, I'm ready to try and win another big game," Schilling said. "My father left me with a saying that I've carried my entire life and tried to pass on to our kids: Tough times don't last. Tough people do." Schilling's wife, Shonda, was famously diagnosed with stage 2 skin cancer back in 2001—the year Schilling won his first World Series—and went on to found an awareness group for the disease.

Now the 30-year-old is serving a life sentence, but he made an unusual—and successful—plea to the court, reports the CBC. Garnier argued that he has PTSD as a result of the murder he committed, and the government is now paying for his treatment. One more twist: The bill is being covered by Veterans Affairs Canada even though Garnier himself is not a vet. His father served in the military, however, and that qualifies him for coverage. "I find it really hard to chew on that we're spending taxpayers' money like that to help someone when we also have veterans that are having a really hard time getting treatment through VAC," says a retired sergeant and activist for veterans' causes. "It’s the best we can expect in the warm fuzzy manner of sentencing in Canada," writes the aunt of Campbell, 36, who was a Halifax police officer. "Prison sentences are the only thing I admire that the USA does." Garnier's defense team raised the PTSD during a hearing to determine when he would be up for parole, per the Canadian Press. They said the PTSD should be a mitigating factor, and the argument seems to have helped. Garnier is now eligible for parole in about 13 years, on the low side of the 10- to 25-year range. He maintains that he killed Campbell accidentally during rough sex after they'd met at a bar. "The message should be sent that Mr. Garnier should forever be remembered as the person who stole Ms. Campbell’s future for no reason, and then treated her remains like garbage," said prosecutors.

Demonstrators are climbing the tallest building in western Europe, London's 87-story Shard, to make their point. Safety personnel and police are watching after the team of six women began ascending the building via the roof of a nearby subway station. They're reportedly "free-climbing" the building; part of its exterior is built like a ladder, the BBC reports. The Shard is between the three headquarters of Shell, Greenpeace says, and it resembles a piece of ice. At the top, says a climber, "we'll try to hang a huge art installation ... that will make Shell think twice before sending their rigs into the Arctic." The climbers, who have been live-streaming the event via head-mounted cameras, are all highly trained, says a rep. Monitoring police say they got a call about the protest at 4:20 this morning, the Guardian reports.

"These songs of mine," Dylan told the MusiCares charity event, which was honoring him as person of the year, "they’re like mystery plays, the kind Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they’re on the fringes now." Dylan was feted by A-listers ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Jack White; former President Jimmy Carter saluted Dylan's "words on peace and human rights are much more incisive, much more powerful and much more permanent than those of any president of the United States." He thanked artists like Peter, Paul, and Mary for covering his songs, saying they "were like commercials. But I didn’t really mind that, because 50 years later my songs were used for commercials. So that was good, too." He threw Jimi Hendrix into that mix, notes Rolling Stone, saying, "He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and brought them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere, turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here." Of his work, he says "my songs didn’t just come out of thin air—I didn’t just make them up," adding, "If you sang 'John Henry' as many times as me ... you would have written 'How many roads must a man walk down,' too." And to his many critics: "Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day 1," he said. "Critics say I can’t sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don’t critics say the same thing about Tom Waits?" The Times notes that the event usually ends with a performance by the honoree, but Dylan slipped off into the night leaving Neil Young to perform "Blowin' in the Wind." (The LA Times has a transcript of the whole speech.)

The famous Italian tower is doing just fine more than 800 years after it first started tilting during construction, according to a group that's been monitoring the 190-foot Tuscan monument since 2001. It's in better condition now than predicted by an international committee of researchers, reports ANSA. Indeed, the tower has lost 1.5 inches of its tilt over the past two decades—it was closed in 1990 because its tilt became too considerable, per Popular Science—with "oscillations now varying at the average of 1/2 millimeter a year," says Nunziante Squeglia, a professor of geotechnics at the University of Pisa. "What counts the most is the stability of the bell tower, which is better than expected," adds Squeglia, who credits work to stabilize the structure on soft soil. A study published in May actually pointed out the importance of that soil in keeping Pisa's landmark upright. Essentially, the soft soil modifies ground vibrations—not uncommon in Italy, which sits on multiple fault lines—to prevent much motion in the tower, which has emerged undamaged from at least four strong earthquakes since 1280. "Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events," an engineer says in a release. (Still, you may be underwhelmed.)

My brother-in-law's in the bedroom. It looks like someone has beat the hell out of him," a woman says in the first, at 7:49am, after she let herself into a locked house, per NBC News. "There's blood all over the covers." Kenneth Rhoden made the second call, around 1:30pm: "It's all that stuff that's on the news. I just found my cousin with a gunshot wound." Asked if the man is alive, Rhoden responds, "No, no." Police are still scrambling to find a suspect. "There may be one, there may be two, there may be three, we just don't know," says Ohio AG Mike DeWine. "We're very early in this investigation." A local restaurant owner has offered up a $25,000 reward leading to the suspects, notes ABC News. But the community of tiny Peebles is reeling. "It's sad," says the wife of a local pastor. "We know the grandparents ... they're around our age. ... What if that was my family? I don't know how they're handling this."

And thanks to her adoptive mom's efforts, the Sith lord was there Friday in a Wilmington, Del., courtroom, as were a slew of Stormtroopers, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and even a family court judge dressed up like Princess Leia as the Star Wars theme song played, People reports. "I wanted this day to be everything she ever wanted," new mom Deanna Pedicone tells WPVI. "It's only once in a lifetime that she'll be adopted." The News Journal details the mother and daughter's path to becoming a family, starting when the unmarried Pedicone started out as a foster parent a few years ago. Just two weeks after getting licensed in November 2013, a nearly 2-year-old Zoe was placed with her. Their bond grew so great that Pedicone decided to pursue adoption, and her application was approved a few months ago. She says she was inspired to make her daughter's Star Wars-themed dream come true by a video of another little girl's adoption that featured a bevy of princesses. Pedicone recruited a local Star Wars costuming group and filled Judge Barbara Crowell in on her plans, and Crowell was happy to oblige, even dressing up as Leia Organa and touching Zoe's head with a lightsaber as she announced her official name change. Now Pedicone says she and Zoe can concentrate on their future together, something they were never fully able to do when Zoe was her foster child. "There are no more strings. … No more case workers. No more attorneys. It is just us," she says. (Carrie Fisher finished filming the next Star Wars movie before her death this week.)

A senior diplomat said fighters were trying to coax Gbagbo out of the bunker he's been hiding in. The diplomat also revealed that Gbagbo's closest adviser and longtime friend had abandoned him, leaving the bunker to seek refuge inside the French ambassador's home, reports the AP. The BBC reports that Gbagbo's rep told the AFP he is not yet ready to surrender. But the AP reports that Ouattara's ambassador to France said Gbagbo is negotiating exactly that, though he did not provide any details. "I'm not trying to be demagogical or to add to the disinformation, but according to the information that I have, he's negotiating his surrender because he has realized the end is near. The game is up," he said.

The Tampa Bay Times reports that Kristen Yaldor remains in intensive care in a South African hospital after she was attacked on the river by a hippopotamus, considered one of the most dangerous creatures in the world. Yaldor and her husband, Ryan, were in Zimbabwe to celebrate her 37th birthday, but as they floated down the river, their vessel apparently spooked a mother hippo, whose calf was hunkered down under the water's surface with her. The protective mama sent the Yaldors' canoe flying, and while Ryan was able to make it to shore, Kristen was dragged underneath the water by the upset animal, which clamped down on her leg and broke her femur. She finally got away, but it took at least an hour for a medical chopper to arrive, then 13 more to get to a hospital in neighboring South Africa. Kristen is being painted by some local media as being a reckless US tourist who didn't heed instructions, with the Sunday News quoting a witness as saying the Yaldors got "too close" to the hippo (it also misidentified her as "Christine" Yaldor). But Ryan says no one informed them a baby hippo may have been nearby or that they may have been in danger. He also notes their guide's cellphone and radio weren't functioning, which delayed help after the attack. His mom also disputes that he and his wife were to blame for what happened. "The facts here are so distorted and misstated," Martine Yaldor tells the Times, adding the two didn't do "anything frivolous." (A hippo killed a Chinese tourist in Kenya over the summer.)

During an interview on the Tavis Smiley show on PBS last week, Cumberbatch was asked about diversity in acting roles and said, "I think as far as colored actors go it gets really different in the UK, and a lot of my friends have had more opportunities here [in the US] than in the UK, and that's something that needs to change. Something's gone wrong. We're not representative enough in our culture of different races, and that really does need to step up apace." Of course, Cumberbatch was quickly called out for using the term "colored." Yesterday, he apologized, telling People he feels like a "complete fool." "I'm devastated to have caused offense by using this outmoded terminology," he said in a statement. "I offer my sincere apologies. I make no excuse for my being an idiot and know the damage is done. I can only hope this incident will highlight the need for correct usage of terminology that is accurate and inoffensive. The most shaming aspect of this for me is that I was talking about racial inequality in the performing arts in the UK and the need for rapid improvements in our industry when I used the term. ... While I am sorry to have offended people and to learn from my mistakes in such a public manner please be assured I have. I apologize again to anyone who I offended for this thoughtless use of inappropriate language about an issue which affects friends of mine and which I care about deeply."

You're obligated to reply to any petition that gets enough signatures on the "We the People" site—even the one to deport Piers Morgan over his gun-control stance. What do you do? Well, you could issue a statement that never uses the words "Piers," "Morgan," or "deport," which is what the White House has done, New York reports. Instead, Jay Carney tactfully addresses the principle at hand, in a post titled, "When Discussing the Second Amendment, Keep the First in Mind Too." President Obama, he assures us, believes in the right to bear arms, but he also believes in freedom of speech. "No one should be punished by the government simply because he or she expressed a view on the Second Amendment—or any other matter of public concern." He then posts a video of Obama's generic response to post-Sandy Hook gun petitions. (Click to watch a much more animated Piers Morgan video.)

In an earnings call yesterday, the company shared a lower-than-expected forecast for the quarter ending in December, but it also shared this tidbit: Members of its loyalty program will be able to use a planned mobile ordering and payment app to request delivery in select cities in late 2015, the Wall Street Journal reports. "Our version of e-commerce on steroids" will give "the ability to create a standing order of Starbucks delivered hot to your desk daily," Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said during the call.

Instead, he delivered “what was likely the most horrifically devastating keynote presentation in SXSW history,” Alissa Walker writes at Fast Company. Loads of audience members left halfway through, then furiously tweeted their displeasure. Many blamed buzzword-happy interviewer Umair Haque, who talked about his vacation, blog, and “generally himself.” But some of the blame has to fall on Williams. The CEO unveiled @Anywhere, a new feature that will allow sites to easily integrate Twitter content. “It’s a slick feature,” writes Nicholas Ciarelli of the Daily Beast, but “audience members were justified in being unimpressed. … One now gets the sense that Twitter is focusing too much on being awesome, instead of addressing the more difficult questions about the future of its business.

Another customer, Jessie Grady, caught part of the incident on her phone, showing the white customer berating two black employees for what she says was an attempt to strong-arm her into buying a reusable shopping bag and for discriminating against her. She also claims one of the employees accused her under her breath of voting for Donald Trump (a claim the employee can be heard denying in the video). "And I voted for Trump, so there," the customer yells in the video. "What? You want to kick me out because of that? And look who won." She also calls the employee a "liar" and another one "an animal," and her diatribe also covered Grady and her family. Grady was so incensed at what she says was this "unprovoked attack" that she created a GoFundMe page for the worker who took the brunt of the customer's wrath (nearly $30,000 has been raised so far). "I'd like to show her that many people are horrified by how this woman treated her," Grady writes. In a statement, Michaels said it doesn't "tolerate discrimination or racism of any kind" and was "grateful for the leadership of our store team." In a Monday tweet, it also expressed thanks for the "outpouring of support for our Chicago-based team member." The customer in the video left before cops arrived.

"F**k you, Opioids," reads the headline of the post on the Brunswick Memorial Funeral Home's page. "What am I supposed to say when we get a call from someone telling me that a loved one has passed from an overdose? I’m sorry? Please accept my condolences?" writes Peter Kulbacki. "Yeah, that’s what I say, but you know what? My visceral response when I hang up the phone is F**K you opioids." Kulbacki, who describes himself as a "consummate professional" not normally prone to swearing, says there's a problem—particularly in his county. He recounts stories of police officers who have to return to the station for more Narcan mid-shift because they've already used the initial two doses they take on patrol with them, and families devastated by addiction turned fatal. "We have to stand and fight….as a community," the post concludes. "We have to beat this horrible monster." The post has gone viral, and Kulbacki tells ABC 7 he's received mostly positive feedback. He tells NJ 101.5 he felt he had to write about it after the "notable increase" in overdose deaths he's seen. He's been in the funeral business 40 years, and he tells Philly.com he hopes the conversation around his piece will lead to some solutions.

Authorities in Nashville, Ark., say Michael and Melissa Mooneyhan were trying to keep their 18-month-old daughter safe when their mobile home flipped over and "exploded," the AP reports. "That poor little girl is never going to know them," the county coroner says. "But she's young enough that she'll never remember what happened." Authorities say the girl was found alive during rescue efforts and is now with her maternal grandparents, the Texarkana Gazette reports. "That baby was definitely their life. They considered her their greatest blessing. You couldn't find two parents who loved a child more," a cousin tells the AP. "She's going to grow up knowing family and knowing love." She says family members have been searching through debris to find family mementos for the little girl. The couple, who were in their late 20s, were the only fatalities from the Arkansas tornado. Two people died in the small Texas city of Van, where the Red Cross says more than 100 homes were destroyed or badly damaged, and a driver died during storm-related flooding around 60 miles southwest of the city, the AP reports.

The National Park Service says the huge rockfall happened near the "Waterfall Route," a popular climbing route on the east side of the 3,000-foot-tall rock formation, CNN reports. "I saw a piece of rock, white granite the size of an apartment building, at least 100 feet by 100 feet, suddenly just come peeling off the wall with no warning," Canadian climber Peter Zabrok tells the AP. Zabrok, who witnessed the rockfall from above, says rescuers risked their lives to bring a survivor away. "It was done at tremendous peril to the rescuers because there were three subsequent rockfalls that were all nearly as big and would have killed anybody at the base," he says. It's peak climbing season in Yosemite, and the NPS says there were many climbers at El Capitan and other routes in the California park. Authorities say the park will remain open, with services unaffected. (In June, a California man became the first to conquer El Capitan without ropes.)

Hodel—who has long claimed his physician father killed 22-year-old Elizabeth Short, also known as the "Black Dahlia," along with several others—says George Hodel may have been trying to imitate the surrealist work of famous artist Man Ray, who was a family friend. As the Guardian puts it, "Two of Man Ray's photographs, Les Amoureux and Minotaur, do bear a chilling resemblance to Short's mutilated body." He may have wanted to create a "masterpiece, a crime so shocking and horrible it would endure, be immortalized through the annals of crime lore," says Steve. Short's body, found in a vacant lot in Los Angeles in 1947, was sliced in two in what is known as a hemicorporectomy, taught while George Hodel was in medical school (the Guardian details other gruesome details of the crime). George died in 1999 and was never charged with the crime, but police records show he was a suspect, and Steve details other potential clues he has uncovered: A handwriting expert found that letters the killer sent to police bore a resemblance to his dad's scrawl. Receipts also showed George Hodel bought bags of concrete just before Short's murder; bags of the same size and brand were found near Short's body. While police seem largely uninterested in Steve's evidence, "my judge and jury are the public," says Steve. (Click for more unsolved Hollywood murders.)

The high-tech system was meant to replace a system set up after an earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 250,000 people in the region in 2004. But inter-agency wrangling and delays in getting just $69,000 to complete the project mean the system hasn't moved beyond a prototype developed with $3 million from the US National Science Foundation. It is too late for central Sulawesi, where walls of water up to 20 feet high and a magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed at least 832 people in the cities of Palu and Donggala, tragically highlighting the weaknesses of the existing warning system and low public awareness about how to respond to warnings, per the AP. More than half the 2004 tsunami's victims were in the Indonesian province of Aceh, and a concerted international effort was launched to improve tsunami warning capabilities, particularly in the Indian Ocean and for Indonesia, one of world's most earthquake- and tsunami-prone countries. A sizable earthquake off Sumatra island in 2016 that caused panic in the coastal city of Padang revealed that none of the buoys costing hundreds of thousands of dollars each were working. The backbone of Indonesia's present tsunami warning system is a network of 134 tidal gauge stations augmented by land-based seismographs, sirens in about 55 locations, and a system to disseminate warnings by text message. (The AP has more on the current system.)

The department is suing on behalf of the EPA, alleging that VW violated the Clean Air Act with its popular line of diesel vehicles, reports USA Today. While it may sound like a big move, the New York Times points out that the suit does not involve criminal charges or charges against any company executives, calling the development "something of a blow to the Obama administration's highly promoted new strategy for getting tough on corporate crime." Still, Reuters notes that the suit doesn't preclude criminal charges in the future. "With today’s filing, we take an important step to protect public health by seeking to hold Volkswagen accountable for any unlawful air pollution, setting us on a path to resolution," says an EPA official. "So far, recall discussions with the company have not produced an acceptable way forward. These discussions will continue in parallel with the federal court action." (Tech execs including Elon Musk are floating a more imaginative resolution.)

With the "God particle" now under its belt, CERN is hoping for bigger and better things out of LHC 2.0, reports the BBC—including about twice the operating energy achieved during its first time around and more violent collisions."It's fantastic to see it going so well after two years and such a major overhaul of the LHC," says CERN director Rolf Heuer. The collider is set to hit its stride in June, and scientists are hoping this time for a peek at dark matter, notes the AP.

A survivor told one of the rescuers there was "this real big wave coming—bigger than the rest of the big rollers ... it picked the boat off and it fell off the wave, it started tumbling," per the Globe and Mail. Although the weather was said to have been calm, local sailors say strong currents and rogue waves can happen even then, the BBC notes. And although the vessel's owner says it was manned by a veteran skipper and had safely made the same trip every day for 20 years, the boat's design is being scrutinized. "We know that most passengers were on the top deck on the port side," an investigator with the board tells the Guardian. "This would have raised the center of gravity, affecting the vessel's stability." Details are now trickling out about the victims—all of whom had been standing on the top deck and none of whom had life jackets on, the British Columbia coroner notes—including an 18-year-old with Down syndrome and his 50-year-old father, per the Guardian. Meanwhile, local fishermen from a Native American tribe who were among the first to the site after seeing a flare go up are being praised for their efforts. "More lives would have been lost if not for the [Ahousaht] First Nation," BC Premier Christy Clark tells the paper. "We're all incredibly grateful." Those who helped recall people clinging to the boat (which the BBC notes had no time to send out a mayday signal) and covered in diesel fuel. "It's something you really can't describe," one rescuer tells the Guardian. "It's going to be held with me for the rest of my life." (A tourist was killed by a jumping whale in Mexico.)

When a friend mentioned Nazi soldiers used drugs, Ohler began scouring US and German archives and uncovered some surprises, described in his new book Der Totale Rausch (Total Rush), per Deutsche Welle. First, notes from Hitler's personal physician describe him receiving 800 injections of animal hormones and the opiate Eukodal, which Ohler calls "a pharmaceutical cousin of heroin," over 1,349 days, reports the Independent. But Ohler also uncovered evidence that Nazi soldiers were on drugs during major offenses. Though the Nazis condemned cocaine, opium, and morphine as "Jewish," Nazi chemist Fritz Hauschild developed a new drug, Pervitin, which was basically crystal meth in a pill, Ohler says. It wasn't some secret operation: Pervitin was openly available in Germany in 1937 and used as a kind of medicine to make people feel alert. It was even put in chocolates so housewives could take part in the high. "It became a drug of choice, like people drink coffee to boost their energy," Ohler says. "For the first couple of days, you don't need to sleep." That made it perfect for when Hitler's armies invaded Poland in 1939. Ahead of the attack on France, some 35 million tablets were ordered for the army, Ohler says. General Erwin Rommel, a decorated tank commander known as the "Desert Fox," reportedly consumed Pervitin like it was his "daily bread," reports the Independent. Even after the drug was banned in Germany in 1941, the army continued using it, Ohler says, and the enemy took notice. British soldiers, and American soldiers in Britain, began using amphetamines "to keep up with these crazed German soldiers." (Another surprising WWII story involves the escape of two Nazi POWs ... in Minnesota.)

A Change.org petition urging the Commission on Presidential Debates to have the former Daily Show host moderate one of the three major debates ahead of the general election is picking up steam and now has more than 130,000 signatures, CNN reports. Petition starter Mariel Waters says Stewart is a trusted and popular figure who has interviewed 15 heads of state and "scores of other political leaders from this country and around the world." "Many in the US believe Jon Stewart shares their worldview and values," the petition states, citing a Reuters poll that found more than 50% of Americans agree with him on "some or most" issues. Martin O'Malley, who would like to see the Democrats have more than six presidential debates, announced on Twitter last night that he has signed the petition. An O'Malley spokeswoman tells the Washington Post that the former Maryland governor is a Daily Show fan and that a "Jon Stewart-moderated debate would be more informative than the Trump-dominated GOP sideshow that's going unanswered, so he's game."

The report sparked an eight-hour search in Sacramento, complete with helicopters, the Sacramento Bee reports. In an interview with CBS 13, Vaughn began to cry as she pleaded for her daughter's safe return. “We’re just looking for her to bring her home,” she said. “Please.” Now, however, police say it was all an act. As it turns out, young Laprea Lee was safe and sound at the home of Antwan Holliday, Vaughn’s boyfriend, the whole time, KCRA reports. Vaughn, 43, and Holliday, 44, face felony and misdemeanor charges related to hiding the girl, filing a false police report, and obstructing police. Police say Vaughn staged the whole thing for revenge because she was upset that her daughter had been dropped off about 15 minutes early after a camping trip with the girl’s father, Don Lee, forcing her to rush home, per CBS. (The girl was dropped off by her grandfather.) Vaughn told police that when she arrived home, Laprea was nowhere to be found, and she accused the girl's father of taking her. Police say a tipster eventually told them that Laprea was with Holliday, leading to the ruse being discovered.

Speaking in Spanish, Reuters notes that Benedict implored the crowd, "I beg you to continue praying for me and for the next pope." He triumphantly raised his arms outstretched to the crowd in his second-to-last Angelus blessing before leaving the papacy. A huge banner in the square read: "We love you." The appointment today is one of the most cherished traditions of the Catholic Church, and this moment is one of Benedict's last opportunities to connect with the Catholic masses. The pontiff will spend the rest of the week on a Lenten prayer retreat, reports the BBC.

Who couldn't figure that out? I'm releasing a new album. I'm going on tour, too. Are you f---ing s----ing me?" He told Stern he was just drumming up publicity for his new album, due out Nov. 3.

A look at what the outcome means for both campaigns: One common theme: The virtual tie is an OK result for Clinton but an "ominous one" for Sanders, as this New York Times analysis argues. The thinking: Iowa Democrats are a white and liberal bunch, and Sanders should have done better. An analysis at the Week makes a similar case, with a headline referring to Sanders' "stinging defeat." If he can't win here, he's likely in big trouble in a national race, it notes. Vox has a much more optimistic take about Sanders' "remarkably strong" performance and chalks it up to young voters. Along those lines, John Cassidy at the New Yorker calls Sanders the night's "big winner." He "confirmed his capture of the Party's under-forty wing, which means trouble for Hillary Clinton"—especially if the rising Marco Rubio ends up as the GOP nominee. Politico has a glum analysis for Camp Clinton: When this campaign started, Iowa was supposed to be a resounding victory, not a "tentative first step." Clinton's "inability to ride a first-class ground organization to triumph underscores the candidate's weakness and the lack of a message that resonates with primary voters." A similar take at the Washington Post: Sanders did well with liberals, young voters, and independents, writes Karen Tumulty. "The photo finish showed that Republicans are not the only voters looking for qualities beyond experience and electability."

But during the final years of his life, that love turned to stress as Donovan felt he was being bullied by Nadine Hendricken, his supervisor at Queens County Residential Services. The stress got so bad he and his wife, Lisa, started fearing for his health. On Oct. 31, 2013, he collapsed at home. He died days later of cardiac arrest at age 47. Now, Lisa has been awarded benefits after the Workers Compensation Board of Prince Edward Island determined that Donovan's death was linked to bullying and harassment in the workplace, the CBC reports. Eric Donovan had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused his death, the board heard. The suit also claimed he had been forced to do unsafe work and work extra hours, the Guardian reported last year. Donovan's co-workers testified that Hendricken was known as a bully, while Donovan was known as "helpful and generous" to his colleagues and "conscientious and compassionate" with group home residents. Per his widow, things got really bad after Donovan injured his back during an attempt to restrain an aggressive client on Sept. 30, 2013. Lisa alleges that Hendricken had called Donovan a "wimp," in front of his co-workers, prior to the incident, and that when he returned to work after his medical leave, she "berated" him as "weak," again in front of colleagues. Donovan also told his wife that he overheard Hendricken telling someone else that she believed he was faking the injury. QCRS has filed an appeal, and the organization's executive director says Donovan never filed a complaint about his alleged bullying. (A 13-year-old boy who committed suicide left behind a letter on bullying.)

The Army psychiatrist, who called the beard a "deeply sincere" symbol of his Islamic faith, began growing it after killing 13 people in the November 2009 shooting. An Army spokesman says Hasan was shaved at the prison, where officials had previously said he would be subject to military grooming regulations, the AP reports. But that doesn't seem obvious to Hasan's former civilian lawyer, who tells ABC News that he plans to sue over the shaving. "Forcibly shaving him after a military council approved the beard for the duration of the trial smacks of retaliation by Army officials," John Galligan said. "This was a vindictive act." Galligan says he'll consult with other lawyers, and then probably file a federal suit. Authorities also tell ABC that, given military regulations, a video of the shave must exist.

Nevertheless, he says that the US is reviewing whether to throw Pyongyang back on the list of state sponsors of terror. "I'll wait to review what the findings are," he says. That could be dicey: The AP notes that it requires the State Department to blame Korea for terror under "a definition that traditionally has referred to violent, physical attacks rather than hacking." North Korea had spent two decades on the list until the Bush administration removed it in 2008; only Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria remain. Other highlights from the interview this morning on State of the Union: On Sony's decision to pull the plug on The Interview: "I was pretty sympathetic to the fact that they have business considerations that they got to make. Had they talked to me directly about this decision, I might have called the movie theater chains and distributors and asked them what the story was." On setting a dangerous precedent: If "a dictator in another country can disrupt through cyber, a company's distribution chain or its products, and as a consequence we start censoring ourselves, that's a problem. ... This is a matter of setting a tone and being very clear that we're not going to be intimidated by some cyberhackers. And I expect all of us to remember that and operate on that basis going forward." Because it doesn't stop there: "And it's a problem not just for the entertainment industry, it's a problem for the news industry. CNN has done critical stories about North Korea. What happens if in fact there is a breach in CNN's cyberspace? Are we going to suddenly say, are we not going to report on North Korea?"

Specifically, she wondered why Black Lives Matter is the only "problem you're allowed to talk about." “Is Beyoncé or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters?" MIA continued. "That’s a more interesting question. And you cannot ask it on a song that’s on Apple, you cannot ask it on an American TV program, you cannot create that tag on Twitter, Michelle Obama is not going to hump you back.” In response to MIA's comments, one Black Lives Matter organizer said the singer "really has no clue," the Guardian reports. According to Entertainment Weekly, another Black Lives Matter activist took issue with the idea that America "allows" you to say black lives matter, as protesters doing just that were teargassed. MIA later clarified on Twitter that she wasn't criticizing anyone in particular; "My question was," she wrote, "on American platforms what do they allow you to stand up for in 2016. This has been the number 1 question for me." The issue came up when MIA was asked about Beyoncé's performance at this year's Super Bowl. MIA is no stranger to Super Bowl controversies; she was fined by the NFL for flipping the bird while performing with Madonna in 2012.

Are you one of the last remaining M. Night Shyamalan fans? Well, then we have some bad news, because After Earth appears to be a train wreck of epic proportions. But if you just love reading snarky movie reviews, then the news is good indeed. Here's what people are saying: "Is After Earth the worst movie ever made?" asks Joe Morgenstern at the Wall Street Journal. Heck, "it doesn't seem like a movie at all, but a sermon." Will Smith's character endlessly pontificates at his son, uttering his "almost literally unspeakable dialogue" very .... very .... slowly … for … some … reason. "I've never seen a movie that moves so slowly, or takes itself so seriously." By the end "you’re actively cheering for a teenage kid to get eaten by a tiger," writes Laremy Legel at Film.com. "I didn't plan to feel this way … but you did this to me, After Earth," by making your characters so horrifically unlikeable—one's a jerk, the other's a "nincompoop." The story, meanwhile, "stupefies us with nonsense, such little thought and logic went into this idea that it can’t even be considered a rough draft." Lou Lumenick at the New York Post gives it one star, and it's only getting that much "because Smith's longtime enablers at Sony apparently encouraged him to whittle this humorless sci-fi epic down from a much longer movie." Even now, the movie is likely to put you to sleep. After this (and his last decade of duds), "director M. Night Shyamalan would be lucky to get a gig directing traffic." But Dana Stevens at Slate cuts the film a tiny amount of slack. "Once you accept the elemental simplicity of After Earth’s plot ... you can stop resenting the movie for all the things it’s not (a rollicking summer actioner, a typical Shyamalan twist-based narrative)," she writes. And "there's a compelling creepiness to this quasi-mythical quest tale." But Jaden Smith simply isn't ready to "carry an entire action movie on his slender shoulders."

The Pentagon is toying with the idea of turning Tinian and Pagan—small US territories in the Northern Mariana Islands—into a place to stage war 16 weeks a year. What locals (who are US citizens) think: Pagan's mayor says the people are 100% against the move, which some equate to an "invasion," the Guardian reports. While Pagan has been uninhabited since a 1981 volcanic eruption, mayor Jerome Aldan says about 50 families aim to return to the 10-mile-long stretch of land. Tinian's 3,000 residents—some of whom own land already leased to the military—could be forced onto a 10-square-mile area. And the plan, which could be put into action by 2017, doesn't just affect people. Biologist Mike Hadfield describes Pagan as a "biological treasure trove" boasting rare fruit bats and tree snails. A rep for the Marine Corps in the Pacific told the Los Angeles Times last month, "We would protect it like it was our own." (Hadfield's response: "Anyone who believes the US Marines and Navy when they say they'll leave the place better than they found it must be slightly crazy.") The weeks of war games could see major amphibious assaults, ground maneuvers, and the placement of bombing targets on Mt. Pagan. Why here? The next decade will see thousands of Marines relocated to Guam from Okinawa; the Pentagon is scrambling for training sites in the region. Pagan is just 330 miles north of Guam and has been IDed as having beaches big enough for sizable amphibious assaults—though the Times points out the Marines haven't staged such an assault in a combat capacity since 1950. A Change.org petition against the plan has garnered more than 110,000 signatures.

Doing so would give them manufactured fingerprints that could unlock his phone and perhaps glean clues about who killed him. The New York Daily News reports Michigan cops tracked Jain down after seeing a video he posted on YouTube that got into using re-created fingerprints to unlock phones. Without getting into specific details about the still-underway investigation, Jain and his PhD student assistant fill Fusion in about the unusual investigative method. The victim had been arrested at one point, so police were able to give Jain a scan of his fingerprints; because it wasn't clear which finger the victim used to unlock his Samsung Galaxy S6, Jain will work up all 10. One particularly pesky complication: Readers rely on the conductive nature of human skin, so Jain has to add a "micron level coating" with tiny metallic pieces to the plastic fingers to make them conductive. Mashable reports he's been testing a variety of conductive materials. Whether this type of technology could be used on living suspects is another matter: Fusion notes it gets "murky," especially with Fifth Amendment protections for "contents of the mind" (a memorized password), but not for "tangible" corporeal evidence such as fingerprints. As far as the legal implications of breaking into the dead man's phone, any info found that could link the victim to any crimes wouldn't matter anyway as he's now deceased. It would a different story if cops wanted to break into the (ostensibly living) murderer's phone, notes 3DPrint.com. Jain expects to have the fingers ready for police in a few weeks. (Speaking of skin, how would you feel about clothing made from it?)

Now Exeter University in South West England has apologized after sending a mass email to staff and students quoting former general Erwin Rommel, USA Today reports. "One cannot permit unique opportunities to slip by for the sake of trifles," reads the quote, apparently spoken by the general in his North African campaigns against British troops, per the BBC. Seems the June 4 email aimed to inspire students to seek out career options. A university spokesman blamed a staff member who didn't recognize Rommel's name. "A member of staff used the public, free access website 'Quotefancy' to find a quotation for use as part of an internal email," says the spokesman. "Unfortunately, the staff member did not recognize the name attributed to the generated quote." (And to be fair, there is debate among historians about how much Rommel endorsed the Nazi regime.) The Exeter student newspaper the Falmouth Anchor, which broke the story, says "it is evident that there was no malicious intent in choosing the quote," but Fox News says the National Union of Students isn't taking it lightly. Jewish students feel "increasingly unsafe" at universities and avoid some schools over "fears of anti-Semitism," the group says, adding that "Exeter must take appropriate action to rectify the damage" and make sure "something like this will never happen again."

Thus, "Sendak planted an immortal virus in the culture, a self-fulfilling prophecy of rumpus, an affirmation that the child’s-eye view of the world made total sense. I thank him dearly for it." Peter Dobrin, Philadelphia Inquirer: "In both his portrayal of the terrors of being a child and the deep flaws of adults, Mr. Sendak was a throwback to an earlier era in children's literature, when 19th century books like like Heinrich Hoffmann's Der Struwwelpeter lacked the sweetness and justice of a well-ordered world. " Margalit Fox, New York Times: He "wrenched the picture book out of the safe, sanitized world of the nursery and plunged it into the dark, terrifying and hauntingly beautiful recesses of the human psyche ..." Daniel Handler, Lemony Snickets author, to AP: "It's almost impossible to overstate his importance. He's a North Star in the firmament of anyone who makes children's books, in particular for his dark and clear-eyed view of the world that was kindred to me when I was in kindergarten and kindred to me now. He gives neither the comfort nor the horror of sentimentality."

Some 15 employees of Four Star Resolution have been charged with fraudulently collecting $31 million, NBC News reports. An indictment states that the firm's "elite" team used "particularly aggressive and egregious tactics," including sending fake legal documents, "in attempting to trick consumers into paying debts." In some cases, collectors tried to squeeze more money out of the victims than they owed, according to the indictment. US Attorney Preet Bharara says the firm took "ruthless advantage of the desperate situation in which the victims found themselves." Court papers describe how the firm's collectors told victims or their relatives that failing to pay debts was a felony and threatened to do things like issue arrest warrants and suspend driver's licenses, reports the Buffalo News. According to court papers, some of the money collected funded the gambling habit of the collection agency's owner, as well as cosmetic surgery for his wife, NBC notes. Four of the 15 employees have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, the News reports.

Under the Demographics Unit, later renamed the Zone Assessment Unit, plainclothes officers would infiltrate Muslim gathering places to learn what they could. The New York Times offers a snapshot: "Detectives were told to chat up the employees at Muslim-owned businesses and 'gauge sentiment' about America and foreign policy. Through maps and photographs, the police noted where Albanian men played chess in the afternoon, where Egyptians watched soccer and where South Asians played cricket." After the AP broke the story in 2011, civil rights groups pressured the city to end the program, which never generated a single crime lead. Arab-American groups complained that the only thing it accomplished was to sow distrust between its members and police. The program had been largely inactive since Mayor Bill de Blasio took office this year, and today he announced that it was done for good. “Our administration has promised the people of New York a police force that keeps our city safe, but that is also respectful and fair,” said the mayor. Two federal lawsuits against the city over the surveillance remain in the works.

Fire officials say an electrical failure ignited the dried-out tree, causing a late-night blaze that engulfed the Annapolis-area home within a couple of minutes, the Baltimore Sun reports. Homeowners Don and Sandra Pyle and their four grandchildren—sisters Alexis and Kaitlyn Boone, 7 and 8, and their cousins Charlotte and Wesley Boone, 8 and 6—were sleeping in rooms connected to the main room and the fire would probably have blocked their escape routes, investigators say. "The fuel load from the Christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and what caused the fire to spread as quickly as it did," a county fire marshal told reporters, adding that it would "without a doubt" have made a difference if the home had a sprinkler system. Investigators say that the Pyles had a tradition of extending Christmas for their grandchildren, and left the tree "lit most of the time," WBAL reports. The final body was removed from the mansion's ruins earlier this week and the families issued a statement thanking the community and first responders, reports the New York Daily News. "Though we are grieving deeply, this has brought us some small sense of closure," they said.

In a recent interview with the Daily Mail's Event Magazine, Wood, the other hard-living, hard-partying guitarist in the Rolling Stones, says he refused chemotherapy as a treatment option because he wanted to keep his mane intact. "'I wasn't going to lose my hair," Wood says. "This hair wasn't going anywhere." Doctors discovered the cancerous lesion in Wood's lung in May as part of a routine checkup before the Rolling Stones tour this fall. Wood says he chain-smoked for 50 years but gave up cigarettes last year, before the birth of his twin daughters. After doctors discovered the cancer, Wood underwent a week of tests to determine if it had spread to his lymph nodes or anywhere else in his body. The guitarist says he made up his mind then that if it had, he wouldn't put himself through chemotherapy. "I wasn't going to use that bayonet in my body," he says. When doctors determined the cancer hadn't spread, Wood immediately underwent surgery to have it removed. Wood, who says he drank, smoked, and did cocaine and heroin throughout his career, is cancer-free now but has to go for checkups every three months. The Rolling Stones kick off their 14-date "No Filter" tour Sept. 9 in Hamburg, Germany.

The paparazzi snapped a few photos of Australian morning show host Samantha Armytage running errands recently, the Kansas City Star reports. The Daily Mail Australia ran the photos in a piece making hay of Armytage's "giant granny panties," "giant granny undies," and "oversized granny panties," the outlines of which could be seen through her outfit, according to BuzzFeed. It also made sure to point out her "loose-fitting dress" and "make-up free" look before moving on to rumors about her love life, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The response on social media was swift, with the article being decried as "cruel" and "shameless" amid calls to wear granny panties in solidarity, News.com.au reports. One Twitter user said the Daily Mail "should be craterized by orbiting laser guns," and another said a more accurate headline for the piece would have been "Woman going about her day stalked, photographed, and then cyberbullied." "Granny undies are cool" and "all women wear them," others chimed in. Armytage, who only hours before the story ran had criticized tabloid coverage of herself, is apparently considering legal action. "I'm not making any comment as it's with the lawyers," she tells BuzzFeed. (This man's gag gift to his wife turned him into an underwear model.)

The Denver Post reports the Rec Act was passed unanimously by both the House and Senate last month. And it was signed into law by President Obama this week, Outside reports. Through the Rec Act, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will come up with official numbers for the outdoor recreation industry's economic impact. That includes its contribution to the GDP, how many jobs it creates, and the consumer spending it generates. In its own study a few years ago, the industry estimated its own value at $646 billion, including 6.1 million jobs and $80 billion in taxes. But with official government numbers, the outdoor recreation industry will be able to "even the playing field," in the words of one outdoor advocate, with other industries competing for the use of public lands, including mining and timber. While those industries have "concrete federal statistics" to back up their arguments, outdoor recreation advocates had been stuck with anecdotes. Outdoor recreation can be immensely important to local economies, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reports. One expert found rock climbing alone brought $7 million into a single Tennessee county last year. Protecting natural resources is vital to that. One sponsor of the Rec Act says he'll be able to tell other legislators: "Look at the incredible contribution to your Wyoming/Montana economy from outdoor recreation. Let’s not jeopardize that by ramping up how much fossil fuel extraction is going on here."

Here’s the weird part: the girl died this January. Authorities say Christopher Byrd violently shook the 11-month-old daughter of his girlfriend, whom he lived with in La Habra, Calif., until she fell unconscious while he was looking after the child on Jan. 12, 2005, report the Los Angeles Times and Orange County Register. Police say he then ran to a neighbor's house to call paramedics. For the next 10 years of her life, Savannah Quake remained in a vegetative state, having suffered a traumatic brain injury. Authorities say her death on Jan. 17 of this year was directly related to Byrd's actions. In 2007, Byrd pleaded guilty to charges of child abuse and possessing methamphetamine related to the incident in 2006 and was sentenced to four years in prison, reports the New York Times, but Savannah's death allows for new charges, authorities say. Byrd—who's already serving nearly nine years in prison for drugs and theft—is scheduled to be arraigned on charges of murder and felony assault on a child on Dec. 4 and could face 25 years to life if convicted. (This case in Washington is strangely similar.)

Still, no ground assault took place, though reservists stand at the ready and armored vehicles are massed at the border. The Israeli airstrikes hit the office of the Hamas prime minister, who wasn't there at the time, and a spokesman for Benjamin Netanyahu explained the rationale for moving beyond pure military targets to government buildings. “It is clear that Hamas itself makes no distinction between its terrorist military machine and the government structure and that they are intertwined," he said, reports the New York Times. In four days of fighting, Al Jazeera says 39 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed. President Obama spoke with Netanyahu last night and "reiterated US support for Israel's right to self-defense and discussed possible ways to scale back the conflict," according to AP. Obama also called Egyptian leader Mohammed Morsi, and the White House said the president praised Morsi's efforts to ease tensions, without offering specifics.

Things were moving in the right direction." Graham fretted that the president's plan didn't fall within the range of recommendations from military advisers, reports Politico, calling it "the Obama-Biden strategy." John Cornyn on invoking 14th Amendment to raise debt ceiling: That's "crazy talk. It is not acceptable for Congress and the president not to do their job and say basically the president has the authority to do this by himself." John McCain says GOP might be OK with "revenue raisers:" "Jon Kyl was in negotiations with the vice president and he said there were certain revenue raisers in other areas that perhaps we could work on," McCain said, but wouldn't say what those might be when pressed. McCain on Moammar Gadhafi: He still poses a "direct threat." He's committed acts of terror, and he is committing more of those if he's able to remain in power." Further, "This thing could've been over a long time ago if we had acted decisively with the use of American air power." Mel Martinez on illegal alien Jose Antonio Vargas: "It's a difficult problem, and what we need to do is find a way in which Jose can continue to contribute to this country."

Singer Jim Peterik tells Billboard that he was "surprised and dismayed at the misuse" of the Rocky III anthem, which was played as Mike Huckabee joined Davis for a rally after her release yesterday. "The song has motivated thousands through the years to reach beyond their limits," Peterik said in a statement. "Its use for the release of Kim Davis does not support my views or my politics. I have contacted my publishers to make sure this usage is stopped immediately." Guitarist Frankie Sullivan agreed, saying in a Facebook post that he hadn't given Davis permission to use the song—and he "would not grant her the rights to use Charmin!" Sullivan told Huckabee that he's not "The Donald" but he "can do better than that," reports the Washington Post, which takes a look at the creation and history of the song. Davis, meanwhile, plans to return to work this week, but a federal judge's order says she'll go straight back to jail if she tries to block the granting of marriage licenses for same-sex couples, reports CNN, which notes that Huckabee has volunteered to go to jail in her place. (When Newt Gingrich used "Eye of the Tiger" in 2012, Survivor members not only sued him, they violated his copyright.)

Police officers then arrive on the scene quickly—and begin kicking him before dragging him away from the flames. The officers apparently thought the man was the same one they had been pursuing in a car chase, but it turns out he was a second driver, an innocent victim who got caught up in the chase. The driver police were pursuing has been identified as 48-year-old Leo Pinkston, and he crashed his car into a utility pole while trying to elude cops after fleeing from a traffic stop. That started a fire that engulfed the vehicle of the second man, now in the hospital with severe burns. "Our investigators have reviewed the video and we believe with certainty that this man is the bystander from West New York who suffered burns, not Leo Pinkston," a spokesman for the Hudson County prosecutor's office tells NBC New York. Friends say the second driver, who has been identified only as a 28-year-old man, had been driving home after work when the accident happened. "This is unacceptable," tweeted Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop. "We're IDing officers. We'll pursue termination + criminal charges as appropriate." He separately said "the entire pursuit that was previous to that fiery crash had questionable judgment calls from the officers." Pinkston, also hospitalized, faces charges of aggravated assault and eluding.

Anonymous advisers to the singer say he wouldn't sell his music catalog, and he rarely licensed his music for use in commercials and the like. While he made money through concerts, sources say he often did the shows somewhat spontaneously, meaning they weren't promoted as well as they could be. Last but not least, the sources say he overspent. They also tell the gossip site that his affairs are in a bit of disarray because he often changed his team and didn't have attorneys with experience handling business affairs at his level, and that he died without a will, meaning his siblings could end up splitting his estate. (Check out some costume designs Prince thought were too effeminate.)

A lot if you're an incumbent candidate running for national office, and perhaps even more if you're a challenger who happens to share the same name as that incumbent. Such is the case for Ron M. Estes, who is running in Kansas' 4th congressional district against, you guessed it, another Ron Estes—GOP Rep. Ron G. Estes to be precise. Per KMUW, the longshot candidate says he is banking not on his name, but on his fellow south-central Kansans' desire for change in the district served not long ago by current Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Candidate Estes says he believes he would have chosen to run against Congressman Estes in the GOP primary even if they had different names, but onlookers might find it hard to shake the feeling the name really does help. Candidate Estes has spent just $2,000 on his campaign and doesn't plan to spend any more, he tells Kansas.com. “We knew we couldn’t out-raise the current incumbent,so we’ve been a grass-roots campaign over social media, other things." Those "other things" aside, the challenger's track record includes 40 years at Boeing, during which he spent time on the aerospace giant's International Space Station project. He's hoping his high-level management experience will help him blaze a trail to Washington against the other Estes, the former state treasurer who took over for Pompeo. State officials recently ruled that the incumbent will be distinguished from his opponent by being listed as "Rep. Ron Estes" on the primary ballot Aug. 7.

The Book of Magical Charms, a handwritten manuscript penned by two unknown Brits in the 1600s, is shelved at Chicago's Newberry Library, along with two similar books, Quartz reports. The charms manual includes everyday tips and remedies, including how to alleviate menstrual cramps, soothe a toothache (use a dead man's tooth, obviously), and craft a super-strong key. It also enters "um … OK" territory, including details on how to chat with spirits and the ominous-sounding "activate the Seal of Solomon." Of the 522 pages contained in the three books, about 350 have been at least partially transcribed, a library rep told Chicagoist last week—and the library wants the public to get in on the act and help transcribe and translate the remainder. Those eager to further elucidate the texts can access The Book of Magical Charms online, as well as the other two tomes. "You don't need a PhD to transcribe," project coordinator Christopher Fletcher tells Smithsonian.com, with Atlas Obscura noting the process is "much like updating a Wikipedia page." Fletcher notes the book's survival is remarkable, as both the Protestant and Catholic churches at the time did everything they could to destroy magic-heavy manuscripts like this. Not everyone thinks the library's call for armchair transcribers is a smart move: "NO / BAD IDEA / NO / HAVE THESE PEOPLE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE HORROR MOVIE," one commenter tweets.

The president, sharing a stage with Michelle, shed a few tears as he reminisced about his 2008 campaign and didn't mention Mitt Romney once in his 29-minute speech, Politico reports. "I’ve come back to Iowa one more time to ask for your vote," he said. "I came back to ask you to help us finish what we started. Because this is where our movement for change began, right here." Mitt Romney, meanwhile, went to New Hampshire for his last rally before the polls opened, the Boston Globe reports. It was also to have been the final one of his campaign but his staff announced he would return to Ohio and Pennsylvania for events after voting today in Massachusetts. "This is a special moment for Ann and me, because this is where our campaign began," he said after receiving a minutes-long standing ovation from the crowd. "And then your primary vote put me on the path to win the Republican nomination. And tomorrow, your votes and your work right here in New Hampshire will help me become the next president of the United States."

But does this flick, with a star-studded cast including Jennifer Lawrence, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, stand above the rest? Here's what critics are saying: Tom Long at the Detroit News says the movie's "frustration and indecision, inaction and waiting," makes it "a more difficult and, in some ways, interesting movie than its predecessors." Lawrence is "terrific as always," but Mockingjay Part 1 "can't compete with the first two films, although it sets up what should be its stunning ending well enough." "If Mockingjay Part 1 is quieter and less flashy than its predecessors, that doesn't make it less satisfying," writes Steven Rea at the Philadelphia Inquirer. Lawrence shines as the "Joan of Arc of post-apocalyptic Panem" amid stars like Moore and Hoffman, who "manage to enliven their realpolitik chats with conviction" in their roles as leaders of the revolution, he writes. "The Hunger Games has turned out to be the best of these so-called long-term franchises," Wesley Morris writes at Grantland. "This third movie is cooler" than others, "but equally tense. You feel as if something’s at stake in this world." Still, it has "absolutely no nonmonetary reason to be Part 1 of anything. It isn't storytelling. It's a filibuster." And you may "despise how abruptly it ends." Moira Macdonald at the Seattle Times agrees. "It's a table-setter of a movie in which not much happens." Splitting Suzanne Collins' book into two movies "may have made sense from a business point of view, but dramatically it's a problem. You leave this well-acted, impeccably designed movie as you entered it: still waiting."

India's ban is on hold for 60 days while it reviews RIM's proposals for giving it access—chief among the company's ideas is placing a BlackBerry server in India, an idea RM has also pitched to Saudi Arabia. RIM's problem is that the BlackBerry is too good at its job—its proprietary encryption is beyond the cryptopgraphic abilities of many governments. This gives concern both to open governments nervous that terrorists could use the devices to communicate securely and those with less noble reasons for eavesdropping on their citizens. RIM, for its part, has promised to meet "the lawful access needs of law enforcement agencies, while preserving the legitimate information security needs of corporations and other organizations in India."

Benjamin Morrow, 28, died on March 5 when an explosion tore apart his Beaver Dam home and left his body under the fallen ceiling. An investigator says Morrow's apartment was a "homemade explosives factory" containing explosive materials including a gallon of acetone, a substance used by ISIS in attacks in Manchester, England, and Paris, France, in so-called "Mother of Satan" bombs. "White supremacist material" was also found in Morrow's bedroom, per an unsealed search warrant. But local police don't think that makes Morrow a white supremacist. "I want to make very clear just because Mr. Morrow was in the possession of this material, does not categorize in any particular light," a police lieutenant tells CBS 58. "He could have been an individual that was doing research." Morrow had also stocked up two handguns, three long guns, a ballistic helmet and vest, and 2,000 rounds of ammunition, per the Fond du Lac Reporter. After bomb experts set off explosives in the apartment and then survived an unplanned blast, they opted to retrieve valuables from Morrow's neighbors and burn down the entire apartment building, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Morrow had worked as a scientist in drug development and studied chemistry at Pensacola Christian College in Florida. (His story comes just after the suspected Austin serial bomber blew himself up.)

The strategy mostly worked, but some high-tech archeology is finally revealing the camp's secrets, reports LiveScience. British archeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls led a team that conducted the first digs at the site in Poland—Treblinka was actually two separate camps—discovering three previously unidentified mass graves and the apparent location of one of the camp's two gas chambers. They found the latter by scanning the ground with lasers to reveal a brick wall and foundation, and Colls says the gas chambers were the camp's only brick buildings. Nearby, the team found tiles stamped with the Star of David, which meshes with eyewitness accounts that the gas chambers were set up to look like bathhouses. "Treblinka had never been looked at since the period after the war," says Colls. "And everybody had assumed that because the history books said it was destroyed, it was." Her team re-interred any remains they found after consulting with Poland's chief rabbi, "and it was heartwarming to see the reverence with which they treated" them, writes Curt Schleier at the Jewish Daily Forward. He got an early look at a show about the findings that airs at 8 Eastern tonight on the Smithsonian Channel. Treblinka: Hitler's Killing Machine is important and "worth watching," he writes, especially as the number of Holocaust survivors dwindles. David Hinckley at the Daily News agrees, though he was a little put off by the reality-show feel of its presentation. (Click to read about the recent arrest of a 93-year-old who worked at Auschwitz.)

A scene by Shakespeare added to The Book of Sir Thomas More—said to be originally written around 1600 by at least one other English playwright, but later revised by Shakespeare and other writers—features the title character imploring a mob of Londoners to treat refugees (in this case, the French Protestants known as Huguenots) with compassion as they seek asylum. "More is calling on the crowds to empathize with the immigrants or strangers as they are called in the text," Zoe Wilcox, the library's curator, says. "He is pleading with them against what he calls their 'mountainous inhumanity.'" The Independent notes that the pages of the play to be digitized were IDed as Shakespeare's work by British Library staff who pored over the text and recognized not only his writing style, but also the grammar and imagery he typically employed. "You'll put down strangers/Kill them, cut their throats, possess their houses/And lead the majesty of law in lyam," reads part of the scene about the refugees. Wilcox tells the Guardian, "It is a really stirring piece of rhetoric. At its heart it is really about empathy." The script will be one of over 300 manuscripts, drawings, books, and paintings on the library's Discovering Literature: Shakespeare website, as well as in the on-site exhibit opening in April about life during Shakespearean times. (A group of filmmakers has been poking around Shakespeare's "cursed" grave.)

She also confesses she can't go out with pals anymore for sushi, because "watching my friends eat my friends ruined my appetite." But the video posted for her Happy Hippie Foundation's "Backyard Sessions" isn't without theatrics: she's tickling the keyboards dressed as a unicorn, with a sympathetic-looking stuffed unicorn forlornly watching her performance from a nearby stool. As Bobby Finger writes for Jezebel, "you can easily expect one or two neurons to transmit some kind of low-level 'awww' message" during the song's "earnest" play. Miley's emotional nosedive reaches a head at around 2:55; the video is here. (Miley had a tough time last year dealing with the death of her dog Floyd.)

But those with ADHD often also experience "hyperfocus," and there is now a growing call for more research into this piece of the disorder, which can be seen in both the inattentive and the hyperactive types. As psychologist Brandon Ashinoff has said, the disorder presents an "interesting paradox" in that people can have an overload of focus instead of a splintered attention span, reports New York magazine. "The field is wide open and people really need to start researching [hyperfocus]," one researcher says. "It’s not about having an attention deficit, it’s more a maldistribution of attention.... Hyperfocus can be very powerful." Some suggest that people with hyperfocus actually have an advantage over non-ADHD folks in that they are able to sustain extreme attention on a task for longer periods than normal. This can be detrimental, of course—focusing on a work project at the expense of one's laundry, or sleep, or attention to family—but notable adults with ADHD such as goalkeeper Tim Howard and musician Adam Levine say they excel at their jobs thanks to the energy bursts they get from ADHD. And while the academic data needs to catch up to the anecdotes, one new study published in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports Exercise suggests that short bouts of exercise can improve motivation and energy in adult males with symptoms of ADHD. The University of Georgia researchers point out that while prescription drugs can also help, exercise comes without the risk of abuse or negative side effects. (ADHD and workaholism appear to be linked.)

Outside of four one-hour episodes aired in the summer of 2016, the BBC reports that no other footage from the British Channel 4 series has seen the light of day—and the Guardian adds that contestants were never informed of this. The premise of the show, which began filming in March 2016 with 23 cast members, pits humans against the elements in a return to the basics. Without modern tools and technology, the group had to band together to sustain food and shelter in the West Highlands region of Scotland. Over the course of the year, 13 cast members left the project, though the exact reasons are unclear. Along with as many as four people absconding due to an epic season of Scottish midges, pesky insects that leave irritating bites, the Press and Journal of Aberdeen reports that food in the commune may have been become scarce. One local resident tells the newspaper that after leaving isolation, participants sought care from a dentist for damage sustained after eating chicken feed grit. A Channel 4 spokesperson hasn't confirmed these rumors, but says more episodes of Eden will air eventually. “The story of their time, including the highs and the lows, will be shown later this year.” No set date, however, has been announced. When the first episodes aired, ratings fell from 1.7 million viewers for the first to 800,000 for the last, notes the Telegraph.

After a petition to remove Renoir's work "from our national museums" on the White House's website in April failed to gain more than 15 votes and was thus archived for lack of support, Geller's anti-Renoir Instagram account now has more than 4,000 followers and his eight-or-so-person protest outside Boston's Museum of Fine Arts on Monday is getting some publicity—much to the dismay of one Genevieve Renoir, who says she is the painter’s great-great-granddaughter, reports the Guardian. She even took to Instagram to contest Geller's assertion that Renoir sucks at painting, saying with a smattering of emojis that the free market has spoken. On its face, the movement is about aesthetics. One sign at the protest claiming "aesthetic terrorism" said as much. "If you took his word for it, trees would be a collection of disgusting, green squiggly lines and eyeballs would be jet black as if they were colored by sharpies," Geller tells NPR in its three-question interview. "In real life trees are beautiful; Renoir just sucks at painting." But WBUR reports that the self-described political organizer is doing this as more of a hobby to "blow off steam" and that he means it as a joke, albeit "a pointed one." In using phrases such as "God hates Renoir," "empty calories, and "infantile green scribbles that look like crayon," Geller is also posing provocative questions about who sets a museum's standards for what is displayed and what the public should find beautiful or compelling. (See how this Renoir went for just $7.)

The video, shot by Churman's husband, shows Churman crying as her new Esteem Inner Ear Stimulator, the first implantable hearing aid for people with her specific condition, is turned on. The heartwarming scene has already racked up more than 6 million views on YouTube, and the Churmans were on Today; watch both videos in the gallery. "I nearly didn’t videotape it, if it wasn’t for my mother saying, 'You’re GOING to video this, we need to see this,'" husband Sloan told Today. "I wouldn’t have done it, because this was intimate for us; this was like getting married or having a child." Churman, 29, says it has been "pretty amazing" to hear her two young daughters' voices, and that it was surprising to learn she has a Texas accent—but there is one sound she doesn't particularly like: her husband's snoring. "Yeah, that I didn’t listen to very long!" she says.

That's how Zeke Smith sums up his adventure on Survivor: Game Changers, which turned out to be a bit more eventful than Smith's first appearance on the reality show last season. As Wednesday's episode revealed, fellow contestant Jeff Varner accused Smith of "a deception" before outing Smith as transgender, per the AP—a move that has drawn condemnation from an LGBT rights group, host Jeff Probst, and the public at large, per People. Though Varner apologized before he was voted off the show, Smith says he's struggled with forgiving him in the eight months since filming wrapped, in a piece for the Hollywood Reporter. "In calling me deceptive, Varner invoked one of the most odious stereotypes of transgender people," Smith writes. Varner, who is gay, implied "that I'm not really a man and that simply living as my authentic self is a nefarious trick." GLAAD has criticized Varner's move, while Probst tells Entertainment Weekly that the reaction of his teammates, who swiftly defended Smith, "mirrors what the vast majority of society will feel. You just don’t do that to someone." After Wednesday's episode aired, Varner offered his "deepest, most heartfelt apologies" in a statement on Twitter, per CNN. "I recklessly revealed something I mistakenly believed everyone already knew. I was wrong and make no excuses for it," he said.

"She wasn't scared of anything," her mother Loxie says at Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana, per NPR. "And for how small she is, she was..." At that point Loxie fights back tears for her daughter, who was 20 when she disappeared from the reservation last June, per ABC News. It's an old story in Indian Country, where up to 300 indigenous women are killed or disappear every year in the US and Canada, but the actual number is unknown because the FBI doesn't really keep track. That's where Annita Lucchesi comes in: A doctoral student at the University of Lethbridge in Canada, she is creating a database to track missing and murdered native women. Her method is to pepper local law enforcement agencies with public record requests, which has extended her list to 2,000 cases throughout Canada and the US. With the US Congress seemingly stalled in its case-tracking effort, and the Globe & Mail reporting that Canada's inquiry is awash in staff departures, Lucchesi hopes her effort will make people more aware. "Very high rates of criminalization, mental health issues and lack of resources, very high rates of trauma," she tells Montana Public Radio of the indigenous crisis. "All of those things create a perfect storm where rates of violence are very high, not just because people are more likely to be more violent but because Native women are valued less. And there are less ramifications for it."

With every budget, lawmakers are slashing into discretionary spending, but with Social Security and various health entitlement costs rising, government spending is growing anyway. The result: "Governmental competence is being systematically degraded. … We are spending more and getting less." By 2024, current projections show that all spending on non-entitlements will be just 7.4% of GDP—the lowest share since 1940. Cuts are hitting everything from the military (sort of) to medical research to the federal courts. Yet political debates never focus on this dynamic, in part because polls show the public isn't concerned. "Both liberals and conservatives are complicit in this charade," but ironically it's liberals who most refuse to discuss entitlements. Hence another paradox: "The pro-government party in rhetoric has become an anti-government party in practice." Click for Samuelson's full column.

"We've grown the Lava Lite business, and buyers at stores like Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and Bed Bath & Beyond already know and trust us," CEO Clay Farnsworth tells the Chicago Tribune. The new name—which the Tribune notes sounds uber generic—"allows us to build on that trust and move into another area." More specifically, it will help with the company's plan to build a set of "adjacent" but distinct brands. Farnsworth uses the example of Jarden, a company that owns 120 brands including Bicycle Playing Cards and Rawlings sports equipment. "We will be introducing many exciting new products and new product categories in 2016 and beyond," Farnsworth adds in a release. And yes, it will still sell Lava Lite-branded lamps, which WGN notes are handmade and involve a "closely guarded combination of 16 chemicals." The lamp's British inventor, Edward Craven Walker, would likely approve of the American company's foray into bathroom scales, as long it helps people lose weight: The Tribune notes he later opened a nudist resort and banned "fat fogies"; indeed, Smithsonian counts his making of "underwater nudist films" as his other noteworthy achievement. (As far as novel inventions go, this man invented the "world's worst smell.")

While the party has long celebrated Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson at such dinners, the pair's own slave-owning history is finally taking a toll. Jackson's role in driving Native Americans out of the southeastern US—the "Trail of Tears"—also is a factor. Democrats in Georgia, Connecticut, Missouri, Maine, New Hampshire, and other states have scrapped their Jefferson-Jackson affairs or are considering doing so. In Iowa, a Democratic leader said it's all about making sure the party lives up to the values of "inclusiveness, diversity, and equality." The New York Times also has taken notice: Controversy over the Confederate flag may be generating bigger headlines, its story observes, but the efforts by Democrats "to remove Jefferson and Jackson from their official identity underscore one of the most consequential trends of American politics: Democrats’ shift from a union-powered party organized primarily around economic solidarity to one shaped by racial and sexual identity."

"No clear answer," says the Washington Post. In other words, the stuff that lawyers dream of—a byzantine tangle of legal complications surrounding Hong Kong's ability to do so, and one that will be followed by an even greater legal mess when the Justice Department eventually asks that he be extradited. The latter could take "years" to resolve if Snowden chooses to fight it, reports the Guardian. Of course, there's also the possibility that Hong Kong police don't know where he is, but to fix that, they'd just need to pick up the New York Times: It says that for a week now, he's been "staying in an apartment in Hong Kong’s Western neighborhood that is controlled by the Hong Kong government’s security branch." Snowden himself apparently asked to go there for his own protection "against a possible rendition attempt by the United States." Meanwhile, an Icelandic businessman says he's keeping a plane at the ready in China to zip Snowden away to Iceland at a moment's notice, notes Reuters.

That's the Church of Scientology for you, he tells Today. "It's a cruel and vindictive organization." Both in their 60s, Phil and wife Willie were members of Scientology for 40 years before leaving two years ago over "demands for money" and "the way people were handled and screamed at," Phil tells Page Six. But then their adult son and daughter, also members, cut off all communication as part of Disconnection, "a form of hypnosis" used to separate families to control members, Phil tells Curbed. The couple tried to reconnect by posting missing posters around their son's workplace. Then they started thinking larger-scale. After raising $14,000 on GoFundMe, the couple has erected a billboard in Los Angeles reading, "To my loved one in Scientology… call me." The goal is "to make people more aware of Scientology Disconnection, as well as hopefully entice those in Scientology to take that step of calling their loved ones," per the GoFundMe page. Phil and Willie are also using a documentary filmmaker to tell their story, per Us Weekly. "It is shameful that two people desperate for publicity would hook up with a reality TV producer to shamelessly exploit their two adult children over their choice of faith," the Church of Scientology says, adding that the couple is promoting "anti-religious hate and bigotry." The Joneses simply hope their message reaches their son and daughter, the latter of whom reportedly has worked for David Miscavige and Tom Cruise. "We love you guys so much, and miss you so much," says Willie. "We won't stop fighting for you, ever, ever," adds Phil. (Scientology is about "us against them," says Leah Remini.)

Jonathan Papelbon, closer for the Washington Nationals, learned that Monday after attacking star outfielder Bryce Harper the day before in a dispute over Harper's playing style, the Washington Post reports. "I was upset," manager Matt Williams told the AP after seeing video of the altercation. "I was appalled." Indeed, Papelbon received a four-game suspension for the assault, and decided not to appeal a three-game Major League Baseball suspension for plunking a Baltimore Orioles player last week, which leaves Papelbon out for the season. The issue? Harper had flied out to left in the eighth inning and merely trotted over to first base. As Harper returned to the dugout, Papelbon angrily told him to "run it out," and Harper retorted with "let's [expletive] go." So the 34-year-old closer clutched the 22-year-old's neck and shoved him against the wall, until several Nats coaches and players pulled them apart, ESPN reports. For the record, Papelbon did apologize: "Yeah, he apologized. So, you know, whatever," says Harper, per the New York Times. "It’s like brothers fighting. That’s what happens." It's a sad note for a talented team that was widely expected to win the World Series when the season began. They were eliminated from contention on Saturday.

Cain thinks he knows: one of his former political advisers who now works for Rick Perry. Cain tells Forbes that he briefed Curt Anderson about the allegations in 2003 when Cain was in the midst of an unsuccessful run for Senate. Anderson denied it: “I never heard about this story until I read about it in Politico," he said. "I have nothing but good things to say about Herman Cain." A spokesman for the Perry camp also denied the charge and instead suggested that it might be the work of, you guessed it, Mitt Romney, notes the Hill. “By the way, there are real ties between Romney campaign backers and Mr. Cain and the National Restaurant Association,” said Ray Sullivan. (The Romney camp has previously denied planting the story.) In his Forbes interview, Cain said he told Anderson about the "baseless" charges in case his political foes raised it. "I told my wife about this in 1999 and I’ve got nothing to hide,” he added. Click to read about a third woman who has complained about Cain's behavior in the 1990s.

"I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents," Trump tweeted Friday morning. "I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!" The tweet follows an interview with Fox News in which Trump made a similar point, reports CNN. "Why didn't somebody call the FBI 36 years ago?" Trump asked in the Fox interview. "I mean you could also say when did this all happen, what's going on? To take a man like this and besmirch—now with that being said, let her have her say and let's see how it all works out." In another tweet Friday, Trump described Kavanaugh as a "fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don’t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay." As things stand now, Kavanaugh is expected to testify Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Ford is negotiating to appear later in the week, perhaps Thursday.

Researchers found that people with low levels of the brain chemical NPY are likelier to be pessimistic, to deal poorly with stress, and to suffer from major depression, the Telegraph reports. People with low levels of NPY were found to have a stronger emotional response to negative stimuli, WebMD reports. The mechanism appears to be independent of other biological causes of depression, say researchers, who hope their findings will help produce more effective therapies. "These are genetic features that can be measured in any person. We hope they can guide us toward assessing an individual's risk for developing depression," the lead researcher says.

The former fugitive mouthed "hello" and nodded. The reunion of sorts has led to a spate of stories along the tale-of-two-brothers vein, exploring how the Boston natives rose to power in their chosen fields. See the Boston Globe and AP. “You’ve got to understand something," said one of William's friends. “We’re South Boston people, and when you grow up in Southie, the cardinal virtue is loyalty. ... And you think he wouldn’t be there today?" William eventually became president of the University of Massachusetts but resigned in 2003 amid pressure from Gov. Mitt Romney and others over what the Globe describes as his "cavalier" attitude toward his brother. "It’s my hope that I’m never helpful to anyone against him," he once told a grand jury. "I don’t feel an obligation to help everyone to catch him."

Stone had "self-inflicted cutting wounds to the center of his body," and police found a knife nearby. He apparently committed suicide after yesterday's rampage in which he killed former wife Nicole Stone along with her mother, grandmother, sister, brother-in-law, and niece. The only survivor is a 17-year-old nephew who was seriously wounded. Victims were shot and slashed with a knife. Stone reportedly recorded a video on a phone found either on him or nearby, but police did not reveal its contents. Stone had been in a bitter custody dispute with his wife over their two daughters. He dropped the two girls off unharmed at a neighbor's house after shooting their mother, authorities say. Stone is a former Marine, and a neighbor tells the Philadelphia Inquirer that he was a "great guy and an excellent father" in the early years of the marriage. "And then he went away to Iraq and came back and was a completely different man." The newspaper notes that among his Facebook favorites was the National Center for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

(The money wouldn't come from US taxpayers, but the State Department shed little light on the companies or kinds of investments involved.) Speaking at a World Economic Forum conference yesterday, the secretary of state said the investment could boost the Palestinian GDP by 50% in just three years and cut unemployment from 21% to around 8%, the Washington Post reports. "Now, is this fantasy? I don't think so, because there are already great examples of investment and entrepreneurship that are working in the West Bank," Kerry told the audience, which included Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, CNN reports. Kerry said the plan—which will be dependent on progress in peace talks—will focus on boosting the West Bank's tourism and agriculture sectors.

"New York is once again leading the way to prevent gun violence, and with this common sense reform, break the inextricable link between gun violence and domestic violence," Cuomo said. "Half of the women who are murdered in this country are murdered by an intimate partner," he said, citing a CDC study.

The erstwhile child star is launching a subscription lifestyle site promising a behind-the-scenes look at her "exclusive world," according to the Hollywood Reporter. Lohan announced the move on Instagram, promising she "will be posting a lot" to her Preemium site. The site itself promises subscribers will learn all of Lohan's "secrets and breaking news before anyone else," including access to "personal diaries, video updates, exclusive personal photos, fashion and beauty tutorials, shopping guides, behind the scenes content, my favorite products and much more." Per THR, the Preemium site so far includes nine posts, mostly selfies or pictures of Lohan and one 30-second iPhone video of her posing for photos. The first post also includes some inside information from Lohan: "I am in a period of renewal and that's why I deleted all my posts from Instagram. Now you can follow me here on Preemium." THR calls the whole thing "a bit sad," while LAist notes that the site's name is "presumably meant to conjure an air of exclusivity, but ... instead makes us picture the nervous setting of a NICU." Preemium, a new site, so far only offers the Lohan subscription but is promising to add four more stars fans can follow soon.

"We cannot beat Ebola without more funding," he said during a visit yesterday to the National Institutes of Health, the New York Times reports. "It's a good Christmas present to the American people and to the world," he added, as per the AP. And while the New York Times reports that monitoring has ended for those exposed to the NYC doctor who had Ebola, and the Boston Globe notes that Massachusetts General Hospital says everything there is under control with a patient suspected of having the virus, the international response to the crisis overseas is still taking heat. A Doctors Without Borders report issued yesterday notes that global help has been "patchy and slow"; although progress has been made in building Ebola management centers in West Africa, staffing is often subpar. "People are still dying horrible deaths in an outbreak that has already killed thousands," the president of Doctors Without Borders said in a statement. "We can't let our guard down and allow this to become a 'double failure': a response that is slow to begin with, and then is ill-adapted in the end." While some may balk at the high price tag, Obama stressed that it's a "smart investment" to make, notes Reuters, and that if we don't contain the virus at its origins, the US could remain vulnerable, the Times adds.

Police tell the Journal-Constitution they were called to a hotel around 3:30am today about "someone shooting at a bus that Lil Wayne was on," and they found two buses shot multiple times; sources tell TMZ the shooting happened within minutes of the rapper's entourage pulling away from the club. No one was injured. Drivers said the buses were shot on a highway by two white vehicles, "possibly a Corvette-style vehicle and an SUV," police say, but so far there are no known suspects.

The fuss started when a Russian official, in rebutting claims of those lousy hotel rooms, accused foreigners of sabotage with this quote to the Wall Street Journal: "We have surveillance video from the hotels that shows people turn on the shower, direct the nozzle at the wall, and then leave the room for the whole day." That set off a furious Internet reaction, most of it along the lines of the Huffington Post's "He's Watching You Shower!" headline, accompanied by a photo of Vladimir Putin. Amid the outcry, a spokesman for the original Russian official walked back the statement. "No such thing was ever said," he asserted, suggesting that it was either a mistranslation or a joke, reports AP. He insisted that no guests' hotel room have surveillance cameras. Of course, NBC reporter Richard Engel said this week that his equipment got hacked as soon as he arrived in Russia, notes HuffPo. “The State Department warns that travelers should have no expectation of privacy," he said. "Even in their hotel rooms."

But the sex-toy industry is really banking on the movie to drive sales, which in turn is spurring retailers to order plenty of inventory and redesign current products to fit the Fifty Shades theme, the New York Times reports. "I would say that every single person has jumped on the bandwagon in terms of making toys around Fifty Shades," says Sara Ramirez, a publisher at porn trade publication XBIZ. Even mainstream retailers like Target are on board, though one Oklahoma consumer complained that Fifty Shades merchandise was being sold next to kids' dental care products, Consumerist reports. The sale of blindfolds, whips, and other fetish-inspired items is already big business: A conservative estimate by IBISWorld puts 2013 sales of sex toys in the US at $613 million (Ramirez estimates it's really between $1 billion and $2 billion). Experts cited by the Times note that erotic products sold like nuts after Fifty Shades came out as an e-book in 2011; IBISWorld says the debut prompted a 7.5% jump in sex toys, books, and videos in 2013. But while some companies have boosted supply orders, others are preparing more cautiously, saying they don't want to be stuck with extra vibrators and feather-adorned handcuffs—or oversell sexual nirvana to their customers. "Using Kegel balls is not too much fun, it's actually hard work to do it right," the CEO of a sex-toy manufacturer tells the Times.

On Monday night, a 42-year-old deputy police chief was stabbed to death outside his home in Magnanville, outside Paris, by an attacker who then entered the home and took the man's partner and 3-year-old son hostage, the Guardian reports. Officials say that during negotiations, the attacker claimed allegiance to ISIS. He was killed by a SWAT team after a standoff with police, CNN reports. Inside the home, officers found the body of the officer's partner, who also worked for the police, and rescued the little boy. Authorities say the child was "in shock but unharmed" and has received medical attention. The boy "is safe and sound," an interior ministry spokesman told reporters after officers entered the home around midnight. The attacker has been identified in French media as Larossi Abballa, a 25-year-old man who was already known to authorities and served time in prison for "criminal association with the aim of preparing terrorist acts," the BBC reports. According to a French terror expert, Abballa broadcast the attack on Facebook Live. He allegedly filmed himself with the boy behind him on a sofa and said, chillingly: "I don't know yet what I'm going to do with him." ISIS used a propaganda outlet to claim responsibility for the attack, the Telegraph reports.

On Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said federal prosecutors have been told to "swiftly and aggressively" pursue people banned from owning firearms who lie on their background checks to obtain weapons, reports the Washington Post. Officials say lying on the form is a felony that's rarely prosecuted. Sessions has also told state and local officials to ensure that federal authorities are being provided with arrest and mental health records that could prevent somebody from owning a firearm, the AP reports. Sessions said Monday that the Justice Department plans to step up the presence of law enforcement officers at schools, along with other safety measures. "No child should have to fear going to school or walking the streets of their neighborhood," he said. The White House said Sunday that the DOJ will be helping provide teachers with "rigorous firearms training." After the White House was criticized for apparently backing away from plans to raise the minimum buying age for assault weapons from 18 to 21, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said President Trump still wants to change the age, but "right now the president's primary focus is pushing through things we know that have broad bipartisan support."

"We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem," said the department's Computer Readiness Team, which recommends a browser change "until an official update is available," reports USA Today, which notes that users can also avoid hackers by turning off Adobe Flash. Microsoft says that so far, it is only aware of "limited, targeted attacks" exploiting the flaw, which allows hackers to install malware on vulnerable computers, the New York Times reports. Users of newer versions of Windows can probably expect a security patch soon, but XP users may be out of luck, since Microsoft stopped supporting the operating system earlier this month. Lance Ulanoff at Mashable, however, says the flaw is so serious that it could be a mistake not to offer XP users one final patch. "Windows XP users could be so disenfranchised that they simply switch to Macs and Microsoft ends up losing far more than it can gain by finally getting everyone off Windows XP," he writes. Security firm Symantec, meanwhile, has offered XP users some protection tools on its blog.

Director Bill Condon says LeFou, sidekick to the film's villain and played by Josh Gad, is gay and the film will feature an "exclusively gay moment." But patrons of Henagar Drive-In Theatre won't see it. "When companies continually force their views on us, we need to take a stand," the owner of the drive-in says in a Facebook post Thursday. "If I can't sit through a movie with God or Jesus sitting by me, then we have no business showing it." The owner of the theater, which recently changed ownership, says having a gay character makes the film inappropriate for children. He says he's a Christian and the theater puts the Bible ahead of any financial considerations. That's good, because most of the responses to the post have been critical of the theater. But Henagar Drive-In Theatre isn't alone. NBC News reports a "pro-life and pro-family" group has started an online petition to boycott Beauty and the Beast (which NBC notes was already the story of "a girl who falls in love with an animal") because LeFou is gay. The petition has more than 50,000 signatures. Meanwhile, Variety's film critic says if Beauty and the Beast was attempting to portray LeFou as gay, it failed. So this may all be much ado about nothing.

Mark Sanford is expected to run for the seat in a special election, and while some had hoped scorned ex-wife Jenny would run against him, Politico reports that she announced yesterday she will not. She enjoys being a mother and thinks that's a more important job, she told reporters, according to the AP. Jenny Sanford had earlier signaled an interest in running. Meanwhile, Mark has not yet made a formal announcement, but was on a search for office space in Charleston last week and has campaign funds. Numerous outlets have reported that an announcement is imminent. Candidates can file as soon as Friday, with primaries scheduled for March 19 and the general election May 7. If Mark Sanford wins, he'll be back in the same congressional seat he held from 1995 to 2000.

The lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges Weinstein raped de la Huerta twice in New York in December 2010, taunting her with phone calls between the two assaults. New York police said a year ago that they were investigating de la Huerta's allegations. No charges have been filed in the case, but Weinstein is charged there with the rape of another woman. In a new allegation, the suit states that the following month Weinstein exposed himself to the actress in a Beverly Hills hotel when she went to confront him. She alleges Weinstein tried to get de la Huerta to have a sexual encounter with him and another woman. About a year after the incidents, de la Huerta was fired from the HBO show Boardwalk Empire, and the lawsuit states she has reason to believe Weinstein was involved. It cites a photo that appeared in the New York Times of Weinstein talking to Martin Scorsese, a director and executive producer on the show, a few weeks before her firing. Weinstein's attorney Ben Brafman in response to the suit pointed out the lack of charges in New York, and said in an emailed statement that de la Huerta's "newly minted version of events including her new California claims are equally preposterous and unfortunately, the product of an unstable personality with a vivid imagination." More than 75 women have accused Weinstein, who was one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, of wrongdoing. (Click for all the details on de la Huerta's allegations.)

In a statement to NBC News, the Rev. Gregory Jacobs rejected claims his wife, Sheila Abdus-Salaam, the first African-American woman to sit on the state's high court, committed suicide. Abdus-Salaam, 65, was found in the river in Upper Manhattan on April 12, one day after her husband reported her missing, per the Washington Post. She was wearing sweats, and her body showed no signs of trauma. Although police called the death suspicious, they're calling it a probable suicide. Breaking his silence, Jacobs dismissed "unsubstantiated comments concerning my wife's possible mental and emotional state of mind." He added, "Those of us who loved Sheila and knew her well do not believe that these unfounded conclusions have any basis in reality." The medical examiner has not established a cause of death. The Episcopal minister appealed to "anyone in the neighborhood to step forward with any information that might help us determine what may have happened during those hours before her death." While some friends expressed doubt Abdus-Salaam took her own life, others told the New York Times she was stressed and struggling under the pressure of a heavy caseload. The judge's extended family also countered reports she was the first woman Muslim judge, telling NBC the former Sheila Turner hadn't practiced the religion in 20 years, and used her first husband's name professionally. "We will forever remember witnessing her happiness as she united in marriage to an Episcopal priest last year," they said.

It's about a goat named Mr. G who got rescued from squalor and transported to the Animal Place sanctuary in Vacaville, California, reports Fox. Problem was, rescuers didn't realize how attached Mr. G was to a burro named Jellybean. Mr. G. didn't eat for six days and moped about in what seemed to be a depressive funk—until rescuers reunited him with Jellybean. "You might want to grab a tissue," advises Katie Dowd at the San Francisco Chronicle. "Mr. G’s reaction is so sweet and so incredibly human."

Caitlin Marriott was heard on video yelling, "Mr. President, f--- you!" in the rotunda of the US Capitol on June 19, seconds before President Trump passed by en route to a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan, per USA Today. Though Fox News reports the 21-year-old's "impulsive" act came after she was "egged on" by fellow interns, "we suspended her for a week, and we took away the badge that allows her to travel freely in the Capitol complex, which means that she will be highly restricted for the remainder of her internship," New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan tells the Washington Post. Per Fox, Marriott will work in Hassan's office through August after authorities found she didn't pose a threat to Trump. In a Tuesday statement, Hassan says Marriott's comment "violated the standards of our office about appropriate conduct." But "this behavior shouldn't be equated with the president's destructive and divisive actions, like ripping health-care away from people." She adds Marriott "immediately accepted responsibility for her actions and is facing consequences for them. The president is doing neither." A day earlier, Trump had tweeted an attack on Rep. Maxine Waters over her encouraging voters to push back against members of the Trump administration in public. "I strongly disagree with those who advocate harassing folks if they don't agree with you," Minority Leader Chuck Schumer added on the Senate floor Tuesday, per CNN. "If you disagree with a politician, organize your fellow citizens to action and vote them out of office."

Anti-Donald Trump conservative activists have stepped up their efforts to find a third-party alternative, but they'll have to file their paperwork in Texas by May 9 to get on the ballot, with deadlines in other states following soon, the Hill reports. Possibilities include former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's 2012 nominee, and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who called for an alternative to Trump and Clinton in a Facebook post Thursday. Rick Perry had also been mentioned, but he earned the scorn of Trump foes on Thursday when he dismissed the idea as "quixotic," endorsed Trump, and said he would be open to becoming his running mate, reports USA Today. Conservative blogger Erick Erickson has taken a leading role in the search for a Trump alternative and plans to hold talks with like-minded conservatives in the days to come, CNN reports. "It's an uphill climb, everybody recognizes that, regardless of the route we go, but there are a lot of Republican donors sitting on the sidelines who would rather fund a third party than fund Donald Trump," he tells the Hill. He says campaign finance experts believe a third-party bid would cost at least $250 million. Trump meanwhile, has a different suggestion for a third-party candidate. "Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise," he tweeted Thursday. "He should show them, & run as an Independent." (Paul Ryan says he's "just not ready" to support Trump.)

Once again, Rand Paul is at the center of things, with Paul saying his stance against the surveillance is a fight for civil liberties and critics like John McCain accusing him of fundraising theatrics, reports the Washington Post. As things stand now, key parts of the Patriot Act are set to expire on June 1. The Senate has gone into recess, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is bringing everybody back on May 31 for a rare Sunday session to try to figure out a last-minute fix. “This is a high-threat period,” said McConnell, who maintains that even a brief lapse in the act is a threat to national security. All this became necessary when the Senate last night blocked a House compromise measure called the USA Freedom Act that would curb the surveillance programs. (Under the bill, the NSA would no longer collect metadata but could still gain access to it from phone companies.) When that failed, McConnell tried to extend the expiring Patriot Act provisions by one week, then four days, then two days, and then one day. All the extensions were rejected, one by one, thanks to Paul and help from Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich. The upshot is that it's now "almost a sure bet that portions of the Patriot Act" will expire at least temporarily, reports the Hill, which notes that the House is in recess through the end of May.

So unhappy that four NYU students have raised $115,000 in 19 days for Diaspora, their non-profit alternative, even though they haven't written a single line of code yet. “That's the equivalent of a significant angel round of funding in the Internet startup world,” notes an impressed Wired. Other alternatives are also popping up, like OneSocialWeb, a set of social networking apps you can host on any server, and Appleseed, which lets you friend users on other sites. But Diaspora has an advantage: It works with your existing Facebook account, but if it notices that the person you're communicating with is also on Diaspora, it sends the message using a peer-to-peer encrypted protocol. “This is the crucial way out of the walled garden,” says the students' adviser.

Even two cans of soda a day can significantly boost the risk of death from heart disease. If a quarter of your daily caloric intake comes from added sugar—in processed foods, for instance—your risk of death from heart disease could be triple the risk faced by someone who gets less than 10% of her calories from sugar. What could get you to the 25% level? The AP give this example: a breakfast cinnamon roll, a super-sized soda at lunch, and ice cream after dinner. About 10% of adults hit that level; between 2005 and 2010, Americans got an average 15% of their calories from added sugar, Bloomberg notes. Researchers led by a CDC expert found that the dangers from sugar weren't just due to obesity: The threat exists for people of normal weight. The study reviewed national health surveys between 1988 and 2010; the researchers investigated data on some 30,000 people. Soda and other sugary drinks are the main problem, accounting for some 37% of the added sugar in an American diet. Desserts and fruit drinks make up much of the rest. (Sugars found naturally in fruits and vegetables weren't classified as "added sugar.") Says an expert who write an editorial accompanying the study in JAMA Internal Medicine, "Too much sugar does not just make us fat; it can also make us sick."

The strong showing has been "the victory that you have brought about." he told supporters at his primary night party. "I sort of have to chuckle when they describe you and me as being dangerous. That's one thing where they're telling the truth. We are dangerous to the status quo." Paul, in a speech that focused on the withdrawal of US troops from overseas, said the result was a sign of growing momentum for his beliefs, the AP reports. He received around 23% of the vote in New Hampshire—more than Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, and Rick Perry put together. Exit polls show he was the choice of 48% of voters under 25, and a third of all voters between 30 and 44, the Wall Street Journal notes.

The new accuser will appear with Allred at a press conference this afternoon, Radar Online reports. This woman, who will be the first to go public, says Cain harassed her when she went to him for help with an employment issue at the National Restaurant Association. For the uninitiated, Allred is fairly famous, USA Today notes, citing a New York Times article that described her as, “a feminist avenging crusader or a deluxe ambulance chaser catching a ride on the latest tabloid scandal.” (Click here for more on Allred and her mind-boggling list of clientele, or here for more on Cain's woes.)

Brian Ingberg says someone broke into his bar this week and stole a bottle of vodka valued at $1.3 million, Radio Free Europe reports. According to the AP, Ingberg says the bottle of Russo-Baltique was on loan from a Russian businessman. He says it has been in the 1,200-bottle vodka museum in his bar's basement in Copenhagen for the past six months, the Local reports. Ingberg says the one-of-a-kind bottle was uninsured and the only item stolen from the bar. As for what makes the Russo-Baltique vodka so expensive (it's allegedly the priciest bottle of vodka in the world): Ingberg says it comes from the Dartz factory, "which makes the world's most expensive cars and vodka." The Dartz Motorz Company in Latvia is known for making armored vehicles. The bottle itself is also unthinkably fancy, boasting more than 13 pounds of gold and silver, the leather from a 1912 Monte Carlo rally car, and a cap encrusted with diamonds. It was recently featured in an episode of House of Cards.

Problem was, Walker is serving 30 years in an Oklahoma jail for murdering a sheriff. Walker—a member of the Aryan Brotherhood gang—uploaded pics of himself posing with a home-made knife, a liquor bottle, a stash of marijuana, and the BlackBerry he used to post on Facebook. Facebook has now disabled Walker's profile because officials pointed out that it's illegal to possess a cell phone in Oklahoma jails, ABC News reports. Walker has now been moved to a maximum-security prison and placed in a segregation unit. He may face extra jail time for contraband found in his cell, and a prison spokesman tells the Oklahoman he definitely "won't be posting anything to Facebook again any time soon."

Trump is a "total disaster" who needs to go, Jimmy Kimmel told viewers. Trump supporters should "treat the situation like you would if you'd put Star Wars wallpaper up in the kitchen: 'All right, I got caught up. I was excited, I made a mistake, and now it needs to go,'" he said, per the New York Times. Kimmel suggested Trump be promoted to a king with no power. "We need to set him up in a castle ... lead him to the top and then lock the door to that castle—forever." Other reactions: Stephen Colbert. The Late Show host played a clip of Trump saying "I think there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and neither do you," and quipped: "The only thing I'm doubting right now is if you’re still going to be president by Friday," Mediaite reports. Colbert also poked fun at Trump for saying the white nationalists in Charlottesville had a permit for their protest. "You've got to give it to the Nazis," he said. "They always do their paperwork." James Corden. The CBS host mocked Trump for saying he waited until he had all the facts before commenting on Charlottesville. "It's true, he only makes a statement when he has the facts," he said. "You know, like when he told us how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history. Or that time he told us Meryl Streep was a bad actress." Seth Meyers. Meyers introduced a new segment called "Breaking Crazy" to deal with what he described as a "clinically insane" performance. "Trump is like a bad waitress in a crappy diner who’s trying to get fired so she can go to a concert," he said. "Congress, isn't this enough? Cut bait on the president." Conan O'Brien. "In the press conference, President Trump said that Steve Bannon was a good friend and not a racist," O'Brien said, per the Washington Post. "Then he said, 'Oops, I meant to say, 'a good racist, and not a friend.'" The Daily Show. The most-quoted remark from the show was a tweet hours before airtime: "Today is the day Donald Trump became president of the Confederacy."

She was also "one of the most contaminated animals on the planet," Dr. Andrew Brownlow tells the BBC. Brownlow says Lulu's body contained "shocking levels of PCBs." Researchers found 957 milligrams of PCBs per kilogram in the killer whale; it's believed the toxic chemical starts causing health problems for marine mammals at just 9 mg/kg, according to the Guardian. The average concentration of PCBs in killer whales in the northeast Atlantic is 150 mg/kg. PCBs can hurt the immune system and hamper reproduction, and the latter effect has scientists worried for the future of killer whales in the UK. Despite being at least 20 years old, Lulu doesn't appear to have ever been "reproductively active." If the rest of Lulu's eight-whale pod has similar levels of PCB contamination, it's "increasingly likely" it will go extinct, Brownlow tells USA Today. Scientists haven't seen any killer whale calves born in the waters around the UK in the past 25 years. PCBs were outlawed in the 1970s but don't break down in nature and may still be leaking into the environment from waste storage sites. They work their way up through the food chain stored in the fat of animals; and killer whales are near the top of that chain.

A report ranks 29 multinational tech companies on their responsiveness to inquiries about conditions at supplier factories; Apple comes in last, the Financial Times reports. The report cites Apple’s failure to respond to poisonings that hospitalized 49 workers at one site. “Apple behaved differently from the other big brands and seemed totally complacent and unresponsive,” the report’s main author told the FT. The criticism follows a spate of suicides at another Apple supplier, Foxconn, and Ariel Schwartz of Fast Company says the company better be careful. “If Apple continues to ignore supply chain issues, the problems will only grow—and eventually, they will come back to haunt the company.”

But before the ceremony honoring his actions on September 8, 2009, Meyer wanted something else: the chance to have a beer with the president. They did just that on a patio outside the Oval Office yesterday, reports CBS News. During the meeting, Meyer asked the president for advice on how to achieve success. "He said, 'You know, first thing, get an education and he said just take it slow and don't try to make any rash decisions,'" Meyer tells CBS. Meyer, who was injured in the 2009 ambush, also pulled the bodies of dead comrades from the combat zone, NPR notes. He says that it's "really tough" to be recognized for what he calls the worst day of his life. During his ceremony, at his request, Meyer's fallen friends will also be remembered in hometown ceremonies.

Per People, Norris was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal adenocarcinoma in September, and that diagnosis has been an eye-opener for the 33-year-old mom from Kansas. In her note, Norris apologizes to her past cancer patients, noting how much pride she had previously taken in her rapport with them: "I really thought I got it ... what it felt like to go through this journey. I didn't," she says. What she didn't understand, more specifically: what it felt like to hear the diagnosis, how difficult the waiting is, how weird it feels to tell other people or to endure the "sad looks," or how tired, confused, guilty, suspicious, and even "crazy" a patient can feel. And she says she didn't realize how important her own role was. "I didn't get how much you hung on to every word I said to you," she says. "I used to tell you that cancer will be just a phase in your life. Just like high school or something … I'm sorry if this made you feel marginalized—it is not a phase." She also notes she didn't understand how tough it is to let others help, something she tells Us she's had to do herself, especially leaning on her husband, Camden, who's taken on more of the duties of caring for their 3-year-old son and 7-month-old daughter. Norris has been undergoing radiation and chemo and will have a follow-up checkup after Christmas. "I just hope that I was still able to give you a little guidance and strength to help you get through your cancer treatment. Even if I didn't get it," she writes. Her full post here.

This week in Florida, however, she met that baby girl, now a 69-year-old mother and grandmother, very much alive and working as a massage therapist in Vermont. "I'm not dead," Connie Moultroup laughed as she hugged her mother Monday for the first time ever in a Tampa assisted-living center; FOX 13 has video of their emotional reunion. When an 18-year-old Purinton gave birth to Moultroup in 1949, "I asked to see the baby and they said she died, that's all I remember," the 88-year-old tells NBC News. Yahoo Lifestyle notes she was never given a death certificate, and she never had any other children. But Moultroup hadn't died: She'd actually been adopted, and her adoptive mother died when she was 5, Moultroup's daughter, Bonnie Chase, tells NBC, adding that a stepmom who eventually entered the picture was abusive. "She would fantasize about her [biological] mother rescuing her," Chase says. What finally brought Purinton and Moultroup together: Ancestry.com DNA-testing kits that Chase bought for her mom and herself last Christmas. Chase's results led her to a bunch of cousins, who noted their relation to Purinton. Then the phone call came. "I think I'm your mother," Moultroup recalls Purinton saying. Purinton is now thrilled to discover she not only has a daughter, but that she's a grandmother and great-grandmother, too. "I don't think Santa can outdo this one," Moultroup tells Yahoo. (This mother-daughter phone call came 83 years later.)

One mom offers an unusual remedy that goes against standard medical advice: Give the youngster coffee, she writes at the Stir blog at Cafe Mom. Christie Haskell didn’t want her hyperactive son diagnosed with ADHD, so she tried her own cure: The 7-year-old drinks coffee with breakfast. Ritalin’s “not exactly a shining success story,” but it’s a stimulant, boosting blood flow to the brain and helping people focus. Coffee’s a stimulant, too. “One hundred mg of caffeine actually accomplishes a lot of the same things as 5mg of Ritalin ... but obviously, without many of the potential risks,” Haskell writes. Some moms are even handing out low-dose caffeine pills, she adds. Still, “just to be clear, we're not exactly following doctor's orders here,” she points out, and "we're not talking about every kid here, either." (ABC News has more details on why doctors aren't sold on caffeine for kids.) But Haskell’s mom noted her grandson’s newfound calmness, and “that's proof enough for me.” Click for the full post.

The temple of wood and clay, which measures 197 feet by 66 feet, contains lots of animal bones—perhaps the remains of animals sacrificed on the building's eight platforms made of clay. The upper floor, which has five rooms, is "decorated by red paint, which created [a] ceremonial atmosphere," researchers say. They first spotted the temple in 2009 in a 1,200-building settlement that's double the size of the National Mall in Washington, LiveScience notes. That settlement and others like it are associated with what's now known as "Trypillian" culture. And like similar sites, after inhabitants left the settlement behind, it was burned down, the researchers note. In addition to the bones, the temple contained pieces of pottery and the remains of human-like figurines, as well as what appear to be game pieces and golden hair decorations, LiveScience reports with images.

Working girls at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel in Nevada, launched a "Pimpin' for Paul" campaign weeks ago that's getting new attention thanks to a recent CNN segment.

The prostitutes support Paul because he's OK with legal prostitution, the New York Daily News notes, and they ask clients to donate to Paul.

The strain of salmonella found at facilities used by Wright County Egg and Hillendale Farms is the same one that has sickened nearly 1,500 people and led to the recall of half-a-billion eggs. More details at the Wall Street Journal and AP. "We do not know how, when or where this feed may have been contaminated," an FDA official said, noting that chicken feed is usually heated to kill bacteria, so its possible that the feed was reverse-contaminated by the chickens.

KTXL reports a semi-truck carrying millions of bees worth between $1 million and $2 million crashed Thursday night in California. The driver told police he had to swerve onto a freeway off ramp when traffic suddenly stopped, causing him to crash. Hundreds of hives—the bees were coming from Montana to pollinate almond trees—were damaged in the crash. Beekeepers told police there was no way to save the colonies, so the bees were euthanized by spraying the hives with soapy water.

The appeals are obvious: juices tend to be stripped of fiber and loaded with sugar, and soups can be more dense, filling, and warm, not to mention tasty given the commonly added spices such as turmeric and cumin. So was this a passing fad? Apparently not. Tech Times is declaring soup to be a diet trend of 2017 that will likely replace juice cleanses. The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, offers up a round-up of new souping companies cropping up nationwide, some of which also offer bone broth options, popular in fasts and cleanses. The typical daily caloric intake from souping cleanses hovers around 1,200. Not everyone is thrilled. One dietician wrote in the Huffington Post in April that while soups are a better component to a meal than juices, they're both insufficient alone and trick people into thinking they need to buy bottled products to get their organs to cleanse their bodies: "Encouraging that low of a calorie intake anytime is a big red flag in my book. I’m not a fan of starving people—ever." She adds that our lungs, kidneys, liver, and skin are "wondrous organs that detox naturally when we don't resort to unhealthy behaviors." For its part, the Times also reported in April that while juices can be very healthy and Americans should eat more vegetables, chewing is important, and there is no good science behind the detox trends.

Paul Ryan's proposal wouldn't have changed anything for people already 55 and older, and it would only have altered—not ended—Medicare for others, says the non-partisan fact-checking website. It points to "nine separate fact-checks" invalidating the Democrats' claim. Simply replacing "end Medicare" with "privatize Medicare" would have been a big improvement, the site suggests. But PolitiFact acknowledges that a number of key voices—among them Talking Points Memo, the Daily Kos, and Paul Krugman—disagree. (The Huffington Post's headline was "Politi-Fail.") Indeed, the Washington Monthly calls PolitiFact's analysis "indefensible." "The House Republican budget plan intended to privatize the existing system and replace it with something very different—a voucher scheme," writes Steve Benen. "It would still be called 'Medicare,' but it wouldn’t be Medicare." (Click to read how Ryan has since altered his plan.)

In fact, this British TV series is the "romantic comedy of the year," he declares. The first season of six half-hour episodes is available, and it follows the story of an American man (Rob Delaney) and an Irish woman (Sharon Horgan) who have a six-day fling that results in Horgan's character getting pregnant and a quick decision to get married. Catastrophe has all the "basic elements" of the rom-com down pat, but it elevates itself by borrowing a page from the best TV shows and placing their predicament in "weird terrain," writes Seitz. "As strange as this might sound, Horgan and Delaney pull off a similar miracle here, by making their main characters a couple who enact the rituals and milestones of a lifelong relationship even though they’ve just met." A review in the New York Times doesn't quite get to "miracle" level, but it's still relatively glowing: Horgan and Delaney "appear comfortable with each other on screen, and by and large they make us care about Sharon and Rob’s far-fetched romance," writes Mike Hale.

As many as 2,000 vets will arrive in North Dakota on Sunday with the goal of "protecting the protesters," Marine Corps veteran Anthony Diggs says. “There is a lot of power in veterans from all over, from all branches of the military, coming together to create a protecting front against the police, who are militarized themselves,” he says. But the vets aren't just bringing symbolism; they've raised around half a million dollars to help protesters get through the winter and are bringing supplies, lawyers, and more. The vets are expected to arrive the day before the Army Corp of Engineers had ordered protesters to abandon their camp on federal land. But while the Army Corps has since said it won't force protesters off the land, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple issued an "emergency evacuation" of the camp Monday in the face of an oncoming blizzard, Reuters reports. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says it has no plans to move, and its chairman points out it's ironic that Dalrymple is suddenly concerned about cold protesters days after police sprayed them with fire hoses. Contrary to previous reports, Dalrymple won't block food and supplies from getting to protesters as part of the evacuation, according to the AP. A spokesperson says that had been "misconstrued."

Researchers concluded that after Los Angeles authorities shut down hundreds of dispensaries last year, crime actually increased around the closed facilities. The victory proved short-lived: Rand has pulled the controversial study for review after the LA city attorney and other officials demanded its retraction, reports the Los Angeles Times. “As we’ve begun to take a look at the report, we decided it’s best to remove it from circulation until that review is complete," said a spokesman. The city attorney had criticized the study—which compared crime stats in particular areas 10 days before the dispensaries shut down and 10 days after—as "highly suspect and unreliable."

The Wall Street Journal reports that the moves could translate into the loss of about 8,000 jobs. The company plans to close three assembly plants next year—in Hamtramck, Mich.; Lordstown, Ohio; and Oshawa, Ontario—as well as two transmission plants, in Baltimore and Warren, Mich., reports the New York Times. "We recognize the need to stay in front of changing market conditions and customer preferences to position our company for long-term success," said GM Chairman and CEO Mary Barra in a statement. One big part of the shift is to put more focus on electric and hybrid vehicles, as well as SUVs and pickups, while sedans get lower priority. US auto sales set records in 2016 but have since slowed, reports the Detroit Free Press, which adds that automakers also were facing pressure over rising tariffs on steel and aluminum.

In what advisers say will be his only interview, the Minnesota dentist tells the AP and the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he plans to return to his Bloomington dental practice tomorrow because his staff and patients support him and want him back. The 55-year-old says he has been keeping a low profile since killing the famous lion in Zimbabwe and has been disturbed by threats to his wife and adult daughter, but he hasn't been in hiding. "I've been out of the public eye. That doesn't mean I'm in hiding," he says. "I've been among people, family and friends. Location is really not that important." Palmer, who brought a lawyer and a PR consultant to the interview, wouldn't discuss how much he paid for the hunt, but says if he "had known this lion had a name and was important to the country or a study obviously I wouldn't have taken it." He says reports that it was shot 40 hours after he injured it with an arrow are incorrect and he finished Cecil off with another arrow much sooner than that. Zimbabwe says the lion was poached and it wants to extradite Palmer, though his lawyer says neither Zimbabwe nor the US has made a legal claim and he doubts they are going to. Palmer's River Bluff Dental office reopened without him a few weeks ago and, after the killing of a safari guide last month, tweeted that lions are "very dangerous/deadly."

The price of benchmark US crude rose 74 cents to $70.46 a barrel, the first time since 2014 the cost has exceeded $70, reports the AP. The development, which is expected to result in higher gas prices, comes as analysts await Trump's May 12 decision on whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran over the 2015 nuclear deal he sees as a failure, reports Reuters. If the US withdraws from the deal, analysts expect Iranian oil exports to fall. Also hitting oil prices was a worsening economic crisis in Venezuela.

Mario Zervigon, his family, and fellow tenants escaped their New Orleans apartment building on Thursday, leaving Zervigon stunned by an attack that investigators say is clearly arson. "I don't know if I was targeted," he tells the Times-Picayune. "I don't know what's what. It's just a shock." Zervigon works as a fundraiser for state utility regulatory board candidate Forest Bradley-Wright, who believes that people with solar panels should be allowed to sell off their extra electricity to utility companies. Bradley-Wright is in a runoff with incumbent Eric Skrmetta, who wants to limit the amount that solar users can sell. "I don't know if [the attack] is connected to anything I do," says Zervigon. What he's done lately: help Bradley-Wright raise about $210,000, including $100,000 over the past 10 days—which nearly equals the $215,000 that Skrmetta has raised. The ATF, which is investigating because the blaze destroyed a commercial building, says it will take "a few weeks" to turn up lab results on the fire. "Obviously, someone did this," says Zervigon's wife. "Why would you think anything like this would ever happen in New Orleans?"

After finally endorsing Paul Ryan, Trump also offered belated endorsements of John McCain—saying he holds him in the "highest esteem" for "his service to our country in uniform and in public office"—and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, CNN reports. He also focused his attacks on Hillary Clinton, the Hill reports. "In one way, she's a monster," he said. "In another way, she's a weak person. She's actually not strong enough to be president." In other coverage: Trump, apparently keen to move on from a week widely seen as terrible for his campaign, even addressed the controversy over having a crying baby removed from one of his rallies, saying he had only been joking, the New York Times reports. "The baby that had a voice that was superior to Pavarotti," he told the Green Bay crowd. "I want to sponsor that baby." In a CNN interview Friday, Ohio Gov. John Kasich said he doesn't know how he will vote this November—but Trump still has a long way to go to get his support. "I wish that I could be fully enthusiastic. I can't be," he told Jake Tapper. "So I don't know what's going to happen at the end." He also admitted that he avoided the GOP convention in Cleveland because he thought it would be "inappropriate" to attend when he wasn't going to endorse the nominee. Politico looks at recent poll numbers and concludes that Trump is now definitely the underdog—he's further behind Clinton than John McCain, Mitt Romney, or John Kerry were behind their rivals at this stage of their campaigns—but he appears ready to fight back with a big push for working-class white voters in Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin The Washington Post reports on a group of voters that confuse some in both parties: Those who voted for Obama in 2008 and plan to vote for Trump in 2016. They say they are being completely consistent: They voted for change in 2008 and since there wasn't enough of it, they're once again choosing the candidate who promises to shake things up. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Trump attacked Clinton over her claim to have "short-circuited" while answering questions about her private email server. "Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president! Look up the word "BRAINWASHED," he tweeted.

"I fear that there's going to be an assassination … I really worry that somebody is going to be killed," the Republican senator from Kentucky told WHAS on Tuesday, referring to Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and ongoing protests in Washington. "Those who are ratcheting up the conversation, they have to realize they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence," he added, referencing Sen. Cory Booker's call in June for activists concerned with ending homelessness to "get up in the face of some congresspeople," per the Hill. "What he doesn't realize is that for every 1,000 persons who want to get up in your face, one of them is going to be unstable enough to commit violence," Paul said, per Time. "When I was at the ballfield and Steve Scalise was nearly killed, the guy shooting up the ballfield … was yelling, 'This is for health care.'" His comments echoed a recent CNN op-ed by his wife, Kelley Paul, who also called out Booker. "Preventing someone from moving forward, thrusting your middle finger in their face, screaming vitriol—is this the way to express concern or enact change?" she wrote. Describing "violence and threats of violence at a horrifying level," she added, "I now keep a loaded gun by my bed."

It's not clear exactly what that means, but a communique states flatly, "There will be no State of the Union Address on the web tonight." A second one reaffirms the point. Why?

Sessions—a longstanding Trump ally who was the first GOP senator to support his candidacy—made the offer in recent weeks after Trump was infuriated by his decision to recuse himself from the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling, sources tell ABC News and the Wall Street Journal. The sources say Trump was deeply disappointed by Sessions' decision, which he viewed as a sign of weakness, though the president rejected the AG's offer to resign. Sessions recused himself from the investigation after it emerged that during his confirmation hearings, he had failed to disclose meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Sources tell the Washington Post that Trump considers the decision to be a major factor behind the appointment of a special counsel to lead the Russia probe. Trump has also complained about the Justice Department's handling of his attempt to ban travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to comment Tuesday when asked whether Trump still has faith in the attorney general. "I have not had that discussion with him," Spicer said.

"Understand what's at stake here: It's whether we're going forward or going backward," Obama told a crowd of 1,500 at Northeastern University. "As much progress as we've made, I can't do it alone." Coakley's rival, Scott Brown, said on a bus tour across the state that he would make the Senate Democrats "start over," reports the Los Angeles Times. "As the 41st senator, I will make sure we do it better," he told crowds who responded by chanting "41" —the number of Senate votes Republicans need to filibuster legislation. Brown is up 51% to Coakley's 46% in the latest numbers from Public Policy Polling.

(The Star has the details on how the goat's owner spotted his neighbor in the act.) But weirder still is that the goat itself was brought into court for the sentencing. As the Metro puts it, "the female goat watched quietly in the corner of the court room as her attacker was jailed for bestiality."

A March 28 ruling by South Africa's Supreme Court, released Monday, rejects Pistorius' request to appeal his 13-year jail sentence for the 2013 murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, handed down in November after prosecutors objected to an initial six-year sentence. "This is the end of the road. There are no other legal options available," a rep for the National Prosecuting Authority tells AFP. Pistorius, 31, will be eligible for parole in 2023 at the earliest, reports Sports Illustrated.

So now what? Chavez's camp says it's no big deal, arguing that the swearing-in is a mere formality that can be postponed until Chavez is well enough to travel. But the opposition thinks the constitution makes clear that if the incoming president can't be sworn in, the National Assembly leader must form a caretaker government and call new elections. It wants the nation's Supreme Court to settle the dispute. "The Supreme Court has to take a position on what the text of the constitution says," says opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who lost to Chavez in the fall election. "There is no monarchy here, and we aren't in Cuba." The National Assembly leader, for his part, says he has no intention of taking over on Thursday, reports CNN. "When (the opposition) talks about a power vacuum, they are proposing a coup."

The latest development: The New York Times reports that she requested research into billionaire George Soros after he went after Facebook. Sandberg sent an email to the company's communications team requesting the research after Soros called Facebook a "menace to society" at a global forum in January. Sandberg has been downplaying her role in the opposition research conducted on Soros and other Facebook critics ever since an earlier Times report revealed that Facebook had hired a firm called Definers Public Affairs. But the email, which BuzzFeed reports Facebook confirmed, suggests she played a larger role than first acknowledged. A Facebook statement downplayed the significance of the new report, saying Sandberg wanted to know if Soros stood to gain financially from his criticism. “Mr. Soros is a prominent investor and we looked into his investments and trading activity related to Facebook,” the company said. “That research was already underway when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr. Soros had shorted Facebook's stock." Sandberg initially said she was unaware Facebook had hired Definers, then acknowledged that some of its work had shown up on her desk. A spokesman for an anti-Facebook coalition called Freedom From Facebook said Sandberg has lost credibility. "In light of Sandberg’s continuously changing story on the Soros research, there's no way their denials about attacking other critics can be taken at face value," said Eddie Vale. He called on Facebook to release all emails about its opposition research. (Mark Zuckerberg says neither he nor Sandberg will be leaving the company anytime soon.)

Scott Waters, 29, of Salina, has a team that gathers a few times a year north of Salina to tear apart and modernize a submarine that is one of the few in the world capable of diving 8,000 feet below the ocean's surface. Waters, the head of his family's hardware store chain, bought the Pisces VI submarine for $30,000 in December and hauled it home from Wisconsin, where it had been in storage for 25 years, the Kansas City Star reported. That came after Waters, who some call "the crazy submarine guy," took five years to build a two-man submarine from scratch. He recently put the "Trustworthy," which can go 350 feet deep, in Milford Lake. It worked but Waters said he only saw old tires, tree branches, and a few catfish, reports the AP. He'll tear apart the Pisces VI, which had been used for oil exploration in the North Sea, put it back together with digital technology to the tune of $250,000 and offer it for scientific research and to the film industry. Waters believes the sub will be ready to launch in two years. It will have room for a pilot and three passengers. Grace Young, the project's science ambassador, says she's working with Waters because "we all believe in what Scott's doing. I'm very interested in climate change, and the oceans are a big part of that. This is very important: This submarine and what he wants to do can change the world." John Smith, science director for the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory, was surprised to learn that Pisces VI was in Kansas. The group owns Pisces IV and V and once tried to acquire the VI. "(It's) actually the deepest-rated one and that's why we were interested in it. We didn't know this guy had it. It's a classic sub, but what he wants to do won't be easy."

Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and their five children were executed in 1918 as White Army forces closed in on the Bolsheviks holding them prisoner. Remains identified as the parents and three children (Olga, Tatyana, and Anastasia) were interred in a St. Petersburg cathedral in 1998. Body parts identified as those of Alexei and his sister Maria were found in 2007 about 45 miles south of the first grave, reports Interfax. Those remains were never buried, and Russia had announced burial plans this month. But the Russian Orthodox Church called for further investigation. The church has canonized the family, and it believes worshipping false relics would be sacrilege—and does not consider the other remains authentic, despite earlier DNA tests. And so yesterday "the samples were taken from the remains of Nicholas II and Alexandra at the Peter and Paul Fortress as well as the samples of [Nicolas' grandfather] Alexander II's clothes," a senior investigator with the Russian Investigative Committee tells Interfax. The remains of Alexandra's sister, the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, ended up in Jerusalem after she was killed in Russia in 1918, and investigators will now be allowed to access them for the first time, the BBC reports.

Or, more accurately, he wants you and everyone you know to print out whatever portion of the Internet strikes your fancy and mail it to him. "We just want shitloads of paper," the poet/conceptual artist writes on the project's Tumblr page. "We're literally looking for folks to print out the entire Internet. We have over 500 square meters of space to fill." This is, as you might have guessed, not a practical endeavor; it's an exhibition for the LABOR gallery in Mexico City, intended to honor hacker/activist Aaron Swartz. "The amount of what he liberated was enormous," Goldsmith tells Yahoo Tech. He admits that the whole Internet, or even a real chunk, would "overwhelm any space," but he wants to "literally materialize the amount of information around us." He's hoping the result will live on after the exhibition closes, traveling and growing—but if not, it'll all be recycled.

The White House said today that it will allow the export of armed drones to other nations, reports the Washington Post. The newspaper calls the move "a significant step for US arms policy as allied nations from Italy to Turkey to the Persian Gulf region clamor for the aircraft." To ease concerns about abuses, the State Department says it will make any nations that buy the drones pledge not to use them against their civilian populations, but instead only in "internationally sanctioned military operations," reports the AP. The US currently sells armed drones only to Britain, and the previous restrictions had allowed nations such as Israel to gain an early advantage in the international market, reports the Wall Street Journal. The State Department says that by allowing the exports, it can now play a bigger role in helping shape international standards on the use of military drones. (The White House also recently laid out new rules governing the use of domestic drones.)

The father of the woman he killed, meanwhile, offers this assessment to a German newspaper: "If it didn't happen the way he says it did, he must suffer and he will suffer," says Barry Steenkamp. "It does not matter how much he has and how good his legal team is, he will have to live with his conscience. But if he speaks the truth, I can perhaps some day forgive him." Pistorius, who maintains that he mistook Reeva Steenkamp for a burglar, is not due back in court until June 4, and his coach says he might put the Olympian back into training as soon as Monday, reports the Daily Mail. His relatives sent a bouquet of flowers to Reeva's mother, but it does not appear to have gone over well. "What does it mean?" asks June Steenkamp. "Nothing." Also today, CNN reports that Pistorius' brother had his Twitter account hacked, and the family is now canceling its social media accounts as a result.

US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly issued the ruling that blocked immediate deportations, prompting plenty of coverage about her and the scope of the decision: Donnelly, 57, has been on the federal bench a little more than a year, having been nominated by President Obama on a recommendation from Sen. Chuck Schumer, reports the Daily News. Before joining the court, she worked as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan. "She will not be perturbed by the storm around her," a former colleague in Manhattan tells the New York Times, adding that she has "a firm moral compass." One of her biggest cases there was as the successful lead prosecutor in a 2005 Tyco corruption trial. A Washington Post profile emphasizes her close family, noting that the "daughter of Mary and Jack Donnelly" made a point to individually introduce all her relatives (including her two daughters) to the Senate during confirmation proceedings. "And then Saturday night ... Donnelly sat in her own courtroom in Brooklyn while families shouted and cried in airports nationwide." Still, Donnelly's ruling—and similar ones by federal judges in Seattle; Alexandria, Va., and Boston—is fairly limited, dealing only with a few hundred people caught in the immediate limbo of the decision, explains Politico. It doesn't affect the larger scope of Trump's order, which could affect tens or even hundreds of thousands of people, and may well be "fleeting." The Times has a separate piece on the legal path ahead, with the ACLU hailing Donnelly's ruling as an important first step. "Litigation is going to be a key tool for either undoing these policies or slowing them down," says executive director Anthony Romero.

Omarosa had appeared on GMA Thursday to offer her side of things in the White House hubbub, and after the camera cut away from Omarosa's interview, in which she said she had a story she'd ultimately tell of her White House days, the camera turned to Roberts, who noted, "She says she has a story to tell, and I'm sure she will be selling that story. Yeah. Bye, Felicia." The soon-to-be ex-White House staffer (if her January resignation date still stands) says Roberts was "petty" for her remarks. More on the Omarosa storm swirling online: "Bye, Felicia" was actually the "ultimate" way for Roberts to say her goodbyes to Omarosa, the New York Daily News notes. The paper rehashes the phrase's history and offers rapper Ice Cube's explainer on its essence, which is a way "to get anybody out of your face that's saying something stupid." It's originally from his 1995 comedy Friday.

The nearby town of Braine-l’Alleud isn't too thrilled about it, however. As the Wall Street Journal reports, the Battle of Waterloo didn't actually take place in Waterloo. A Belgian historian's research shows that three of the key fights were in Braine-l’Alleud and two more were in Plancenoit—but because a duke filed his dispatch from his headquarters in Waterloo, that name has gotten all the glory. “Nobody will ever call it the ‘Battle of Braine-l’Alleud.’ That would be completely ridiculous, and that’s not our goal at all,” says the town’s mayor. "But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to correct errors that were made.” Among other things, the town is suing Michelin over a tour guide that it says doesn't give Braine-l’Alleud its due. This isn't the only Waterloo-related disagreement related to the anniversary. Belgium has minted coins worth 2.50 euros to commemorate the defeat of the French emperor, and France is a little miffed. First, it blocked Belgium from issuing coins worth 2 euros that would be legal tender throughout the EU, a move that meant 180,000 coins had to be melted down, reports CNN. But then "Belgium resorted to a cunning ruse de guerre to outflank the French," reports the Financial Times. Taking advantage of an obscure clause, it minted the non-standard 2.50 coin, which can be used only in Belgium itself. (The first full skeleton from the Battle of Waterloo has been identified as that of a German hunchback.)

Santorum was one of the foremost voices calling for Republicans to reject the treaty, and in the Daily Beast today he explains why, suggesting that, under the treaty, disabled children would have their fates decided by "a well-meaning but faceless and distant United Nations bureaucrat" rather than their parents. The US, he argued, "should be telling the UN, not the other way around, how to ensure dignity and respect for the disabled." Of course, proponents would say that's exactly what this was. The treaty was based on the Americans with Disabilities Act. The US "could have shown its leadership by ratifying the treaty," writes Michael Yudell of the Philadelphia Inquirer. Instead we got "nonsense" about the UN taking our sovereignty. "I’m curious whether these same Senators and other treaty opponents thought The X-Files was a documentary film." At the New York Times, Lawrence Downes calls it "a parting slap at Bob Dole," who arrived in a wheel chair and was greeted warmly by each Republican—before most voted against the treaty.

Some 562 authors, from Margaret Atwood to Don DeLillo to Ian McEwan, are following tech firms' anti-surveillance push with one of their own: They're calling on the UN to create a global bill of digital rights, the Guardian reports. Current snooping, as revealed by Edward Snowden, makes everyone a suspect, say the authors, who hail from 81 countries and also include Kazuo Ishiguro, Jeffrey Eugenides, Dave Eggers, and Tom Stoppard. Their petition, which doesn't specifically mention the NSA or Britain's GCHQ, says humans have the "fundamental" right to "remain unobserved and unmolested." It notes that "a person under surveillance is no longer free; a society under surveillance is no longer a democracy. To maintain any validity, our democratic rights must apply in virtual as in real space." The authors urge the creation of a digital rights convention that governments would "sign and adhere to." Notes Juli Zeh, a writer behind the effort: "We all have to stand up now, and we as writers do what we can do best: Use the written word to intervene publicly." In agreement?

Paul today blamed reports to the contrary on a "misrepresentation from the media." Here's the quote from yesterday, via the Washington Post: “I can't imagine that we won't require 60 votes on this. Whether there’s an actual standing filibuster—I’ve got to check my shoes and check my ability to hold my water. And we will see. I haven’t made a decision on that.” After that, the New York Times quoted an aide saying that Paul would indeed filibuster. That has changed now, apparently. Slate has more on Paul's views: Essentially, he thinks that any US intervention would only make things worse—for the US, for Syrians, for Israel, for the entire region. "I think it's almost inevitable there'll be a second war if Assad falls," he says, adding that it might well result in "radical Islamists" taking over. Paul also tried to use President Obama's own words against him, notes Mediaite: In a proposed resolution, he quoted the then-senator warning the Bush camp not to strike Iran in 2007: “The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.” Paul's resolution failed today.

Yes, even Lindsay Lohan is apparently reminded of Lindsay Lohan when she reads about Bynes' troubles, as evidenced by this tweet from LiLo: "Why did I get put in jail and a nickelodeon star has had NO punishment(s) so far?" Shockingly, we have to agree with La Lohan on this one, although to be fair, Bynes has thus far avoided implication in any jewelry thefts. Lohan aired the sentiment shortly after news broke that Bynes—whose license is suspended—was pulled over yet again yesterday. Her car, at least, got impounded this time, E! reports. Prior to that, Bynes was photographed driving Thursday night with her face covered, which is probably about as safe as it sounds. But she insists she's fine and totally not crazy, TMZ reports. She also denies smoking pot while driving, and says the pipe she was pictured with in her car actually contained tobacco. Which sounds likely.

The answer appears to be no. According to NBC News, a CDC report released Thursday shows a 17% increase in HPV-related cancers between 2004 and 2012 to nearly 39,000 per year. Dr. Lois Ramondetta, an expert in gynecologic oncology, says it's become an "epidemic" especially for men, in whom HPV can cause cancers of the mouth, tongue, and throat. HPV increases the risk of those cancers by at least seven times, and unlike with HPV-caused cervical cancer in women, there's no screening for them. The CDC report found 93% of all HPV-related cancers could be prevented with the currently available vaccine. That's approximately 28,500 fewer cases of cancer every year, AFP reports. And yet in 2014, only 40% of teen girls and 22% of teen boys received the necessary three doses of the vaccine, which works best if administered before teens become sexually active. Paskett calls those numbers "extremely sad." “We must change the perception of the HPV vaccine from something that prevents a sexually transmitted disease to a vaccine that prevents cancer," she tells CBS. (Some British teens invented condoms that change color near HPV and other STDs.)

"Now you come out ... from the 'Trump church' in the Republican primary with a big Trump halo," says Mike Murphy on NBC's Meet the Press. "But in the general election, Democrats all hate Trump and among Independents he's mostly upside-down. So what is your magic light sword in the primary becomes an anchor around your neck in the general." Murphy laments that such "all Trump all the time" candidates are commonplace: "It's like the Stalin trials now. If you wore the collectivist tie, you're out of order. It's the new reality of the Republican primary." For more around the dial: The lies: "This has never happened before," says ex-White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, a veteran of Bill Clinton's administration, on CNN's Reliable Sources, per the Hill. "We've had great presidents, we've had terrible presidents, Republicans and Democrats, but we've never had anything like this—where we have a president who is incapable of telling the truth." The narcissism: "Our message is rescue America—and we will rescue America—from the grasp of an unhinged narcissist who is creating ... chaos," says Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, on ABC's This Week, per USA Today.

Of course, Angelina Jolie is perhaps a little bit older than most of us were when we came down with the itchy illness.

The comedian drew outrage after a May stunt in which she was photographed wielding a bloody, decapitated fake head of President Trump, and she says a federal investigation has cleared her of posing a real threat to the 45th president. "The case is closed," Griffin tweeted Friday. USA Today reports that the Secret Service, which typically probes any possible presidential threats, did not confirm Griffin’s post. CNN fired Griffin as host of its New Year’s show over the photo, and she lost other comedy gigs, per USA Today. Vulture quips that with the controversy behind her, "Hopefully, Kathy Griffin will be able to move on to less violent, severed head-based critiques of the Trump administration."

The AP reports that since April, a GoFundMe account set up to raise money to aid protesters has far surpassed the $5,000 its organizer had originally hoped it would reach: Over the past six months, more than 21,000 people have contributed to boost the fund to over $1 million. "It still feels unreal sometimes because it is such an astronomical figure to me," says Howaste Wikaya, a protester who set up the fundraising page. But Wikaya adds the money is spent practically the moment it's received: A local tribal historian tells the AP that only about $100,000 from the fund remained as of Friday night for the camp, situated near Cannon Ball where the Missouri and Cannonball rivers meet—and North Dakota's unforgiving winter is coming. Where the money has gone: groceries that run about $2,000 every two days, 20 yurts ($160,000 in total), and bail money (about $7,000 so far) for those arrested for protesting the $3.8 billion pipeline, which protesters say will disturb drinking water and plow through cultural artifacts of the nearby Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Per InsideSources, however, the protests have benefited from other fundraising as well—one effort has set aside more than $860,000 just for "the legal defense of warriors protecting land, water and human rights"—and some even claim donated supplies have been wasted. But donors continue to send financial support, including one New Hampshire woman from a community that fought its own natural gas pipeline. "This really, really struck a chord with me," she tells the AP. (CNN talks with some Standing Rock Sioux who protest the protest.)

"The initial determination was based on a flawed process," the source says, with investigators mistakenly thinking one email contained information from a top-secret report that "actually postdated the email in question." The State Department and the inspector general of the intelligence community have clashed over whether the emails were classified or not and the source says the office of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has ruled in the State Department's favor, though a Clapper spokesman says the review isn't over. The emails were not on the agenda when Clinton, Sanders, and Martin O'Malley appeared at MSNBC's First in the South Democratic Presidential forum in South Carolina on Friday night, moderated by Rachel Maddow, the Guardian reports. Instead, the candidates clashed over gun laws, the death penalty, campaign finance, and the Keystone pipeline. Sanders and O'Malley both accused Clinton of taking far too long to decide she was against the pipeline project, with Sanders calling opposition to transporting "some of the dirtiest fuel on this planet" a "no brainer," the Guardian notes. (Sanders has introduced the first Senate bill to legalize recreational marijuana across the US.)

Two days after House Republicans voted to release a memo regarding FBI surveillance and one day after President Trump was overheard saying he would release it, the FBI publicly came out opposing that plan. "We have grave concerns about the material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo’s accuracy," the FBI said in a statement Wednesday. The memo prepared by staffers for Rep. Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, concerns the role of the so-called Steele dossier in federal surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Last week, the Justice Department warned the House Intelligence Committee that releasing it would be "extraordinarily reckless." The intelligence community worries making the classified document public would inform foreign targets how to avoid surveillance. FBI Director Christopher Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein met with Chief of Staff John Kelly on Monday in an attempt to prevent the memo from being released. And Democrats say the memo picks and chooses information to cast doubt on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference and possible collusion by the Trump campaign. Regardless, Kelly told Fox News Radio on Wednesday that the memo will be released "pretty quick."

The rapper was scheduled to appear at Columbia's Colonial Life Arena with a slew of other acts, including Cardi B and 2 Chainz, as part of the second annual Fall Ball, but he balked at following "standard safety procedures" at a checkpoint, the arena noted in a statement. Instead, he turned around and left, leaving the show to go on without him. "While we regret the artist's decision not to perform, Colonial Life Arena is not willing to bypass its security standards and jeopardize the safety of its patrons, performers, or staff members," the arena statement read. Refunds will start to be doled out Monday "at the point of purchase," the statement notes, per the State.

Obama’s speech, despite the customarily excessive use of 'I,' 'me,' and 'my,' was workmanlike and wise in its emphasis on continuity of strategy." Josh Marshall, Talking Points Memo: "If something like this went unchallenged Obama's status as the ultimate commander of the American military would pass a threshold level of credibility. And yet ... I'm not sure I thought he had it in him. But he did. I've learned something." Max Boot, Commentary: "If there is one general who can step quickly into the top job in Afghanistan, it is Petraeus. ... And if there is one general who knows how to handle the media and the political process (skills that McChrystal obviously lacked), it is Petraeus." Susan Davis, Wall Street Journal: "Obama may have made a smart tactical move that will shield his nominee from any pushback from congressional Republicans because they like Petraeus. They really, really like him."

Read the full text here. A quick survey of bloggers of all stripes finds them underwhelmed, in part because they don't see much hope of the president winning congressional approval on key parts: Ezra Klein, Washington Post: It's "not a very good plan," with the first part focusing on expanding domestic production of oil, "the very fuel we need to be weaning ourselves off of." And it doesn't get much better. "Obama needs to look presidential and solutions-oriented while Congress squabbles over the budget for the rest of 2011. On all those measures, this plan will very likely be successful. It just won’t do much for the planet." Economist: "It is hard to see his half-baked, reheated list of proposals as anything more than a reassurance to the environmentally-minded, and to Americans fretting about rising fuel prices, that the president feels their pain—unlike those nasty Republicans." Andrew Revkin, New York Times: "It’s a creditable speech, emphasizing the need for responsible extraction of natural gas and safe production of nuclear power. ... But there are 'same-old' lines on biofuels and no mention of the need for Americans, as a patriotic responsibility at the very least, to reconsider energy habits." Grist: On the ambitious goal of slashing oil imports: "It's hard to think of anything—short of an economic crash bigger than any ever seen in US history, or perhaps an alien race forcing all of us to take to our bicycles—that could conceivably accomplish such a goal."

A friend found the 26-year-old unconscious at his Florida home just after midnight on Tuesday, per McCarver's girlfriend, the WWE star Dana Brooke. She says she spoke to McCarver shortly before he died as he was about to make dinner. His last words to her were, "I love you. Goodbye." Law enforcement sources tell TMZ there were no signs of foul play. No cause of death was given. TMZ notes McCarver had worked out earlier on Monday with 160-pound dumbbells and appeared to be fine. Bodybuilding.com reports that McCarver's roommate and training partner, Josh Lenartowicz, found him facedown in the kitchen with food in his mouth. He failed to revive him and called paramedics. In March, McCarver collapsed on stage at the Arnold Classic, but he later appeared to be recovered in videos he posted, the New York Daily News reports. The 6-foot-1, 300-plus-pound weightlifter has been competing since he was 21. A rising star, he became the youngest pro in 2012 when he won the North American Championships, per Bodybuilding.com.

That's what a Scottish tourist says led to his arrest in Dubai for touching a man's hip, the BBC reports. Jamie Harron, 27, says he was walking with a drink in the crowded Rock Bottom Cafe when he put out his hand "to avoid impact" with a patron, per the Press Association. The incident happened July 15 after the electrician stopped off in Dubai for a couple days en route to a job in Afghanistan. Police arrested Harron on charges of public indecency and drinking alcohol, casting the electrician in an "outrageous" saga that shows no signs of ending, says Radha Stirling of the Detained in Dubai NGO. "This is another example of how vulnerable tourists are to arrest and detention in Dubai," she says. Harron was locked up for five days and his passport was seized so he couldn't leave the country while the case is pending. Stirling says Harron "is under immense pressure and stress." He lost his job and has so far racked up more than $39,000 in legal bills and expenses for what he calls a "cultural misunderstanding," per the Sun. His parents say their son has never been in trouble before. "We can't believe that this nightmare has gone on for three months. Jamie is a good boy," says dad Graham Harron.

In the London Review of Books, Hersh writes that the US didn't, as it has said, discover bin Laden's location through couriers. Instead, top Pakistani generals knew where bin Laden was—in fact, as Hersh puts it, "bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006," and a Pakistani official revealed the information for a large portion of a $25 million reward the US had put forward in 2001. Hersh bases his report largely on an anonymous source he describes as "a retired senior intelligence official who was knowledgeable about the initial intelligence about bin Laden’s presence in Abbottabad." Obama did order the Navy SEALs raid on the compound, but it didn't happen the way the White House has said, Hersh writes. "There was no firefight as they moved into the compound," the source says. Bin Laden, who was an "invalid," was simply shot. Ensuing accounts, including President Obama's speech, provided inaccurate details. Though Obama acknowledged working with Pakistani intelligence, the account by John Brennan, now the CIA head, rejected the idea that Pakistan had any knowledge of bin Laden's location. Hersh's report is an "explosive" one, writes Seth Maxon at Slate, but he notes that its trustworthiness is uncertain, "since it mostly relies on the information of a single anonymous source—and because it doesn't appear in Hersh's usual venue for blockbuster investigative pieces, the New Yorker." Business Insider agrees that it "should be viewed with skepticism." Read it all here.

He was 88 and had been the world's longest reigning monarch, reports the AP. The Royal Palace said Bhumibol died "in a peaceful state" at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, where he underwent an operation over the weekend and had been treated over the past decade. During a reign that spanned 70 years, the US-born Bhumibol was the nation's one constant as myriad governments rose and fell, a gentle leader who used the throne's influence to unify the nation and rally troops through the Cold War as Thailand's neighbors fell under communist control. In his heyday, the frail, soft-spoken man in spectacles wielded so much power and respect, he could squelch coups and rebellions with a gesture or a few well-chosen words. Bhumibol was the world's richest monarch and one of the planet's wealthiest people: Forbes magazine estimated his fortune at more than $30 billion in 2011. Although not known for having extravagant tastes, he nevertheless lived the elite life of a modern-day king, racing yachts and appearing at official functions clothed in ornate golden robes. Over the last decade, the once vigorous Bhumibol had withdrawn from public life due to a series of illnesses. His wife, Queen Sirikit, has also long been ailing and has been even more rarely seen. Strong anti-defamation laws in Thailand make it a severe crime to speak ill of the king or the royal family, making it sometimes difficult for outsiders to gauge public opinion. However, NPR reports that the king's successor, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, is clearly less well-liked than his father. Thailand's PM says the government will observe a one-year mourning period and flags will fly at half-staff for 30 days. No government events will be held for 30 days, he added. The world's longest reigning monarch is now Queen Elizabeth II, who ascended to the British throne in 1952.

Constable Jarrod Singh of Toronto's Durham Regional Police Service was called to the scene of a fight Sunday night, CBC reports. He arrived to find eight people surrounding another person. Singh says he can see how someone mistook it for a fight; but the person in the center of the crowd was actually break dancing. It turns out the group were members of the University of Ontario Institute of Technology's dance troupe and were filming a music video. The dancers thought they were about to be shut down when Singh showed up. Instead, after talking with the group for a bit, Singh says he "decided it was time to bust a move," the Global News reports. The results, according to the Ottawa Citizen, were "amazing." The Facebook video of Singh breaking it down with one of the dancers has been shared more than 800,000 times. This wasn't the constable's first rodeo; before joining the police, he was a member of his college's dance troupe, which once opened for rapper Rick Ross.

Starting in April, Bar Marco will stop accepting tips and start paying its full-time servers $35,000 a year, plus benefits unusual for the restaurant world: health care, paid vacation, and shares in the company, reports Next Pittsburgh. It won't add a service fee to the bill or otherwise raise prices to pay for the switch. “All of our current employees have seen and approved the contract,” says co-owner Robert Fry. “They will have a lot of responsibilities, too—like being present at bi-monthly finance meetings.

Lohan was prohibited from driving while working on the movie, as required by the insurance policy taken out by the production company, sources tell TMZ. The insurance company was reluctant to issue the policy in the first place, seeing as how LiLo is not exactly what one would call reliable, so it set a bunch of conditions including banning the accident-prone Lohan from taking to the open road. The production company apparently didn't care that Lindsay was violating the ban by driving anyway … until she crashed, in full view of a production SUV that was following her, sources say. What does this mean for her? The insurance company reportedly hasn't tried to cancel the policy, but the production company is now cracking down on Lindsay's driving privileges. If you've somehow managed to avoid them until now, TMZ has photos of the wrecked Porsche.

The Washington Post calls the move “apparently unprecedented.” President Obama’s top lawyer had sought a deal and White House officials had delivered some 20,000 more pages of emails and other documents to investigators yesterday, while Democrats on the panel fought the decision; the vote nonetheless came down 14-9 along party lines. The communications requested involve Bill Daley and Joe Biden’s chief of staff Bruce Reed, as well as a broad selection of other senior aides including Rahm Emanuel, Valerie Jarrett, Larry Summers, and former Biden chief of staff Ron Klain. Rep. Cliff Stearns says he also wants to see the president’s relevant BlackBerry messages, Politico reports. The panel’s ranking Democrat called the move a partisan attack and “sad day” for the committee.

If not, it seems inevitable that will happen soon, given his viral videos and headlines referring to the "Jordan Peterson Moment" and the "Jordan Peterson Phenomenon." Peterson is a 55-year-old psychologist at the University of Toronto whose latest book, 12 Rules for Life, has become an international best-seller. In fact, Peterson has managed to become "one of the most influential—and polarizing—public intellectuals in the English-speaking world," writes Kelefa Sanneh in the New Yorker. Some basics about him: A theme, and critique: Peterson "delivers stern fatherly lectures to young men on how to be honorable, upright, and self-disciplined—how to grow up and take responsibility for their own lives," writes David Brooks in the New York Times. The message has found an audience, though Brooks says it "sounds to me like vague exhortatory banality." Peterson's "recipe for self-improvement is solitary, nonrelational, unemotional," and Brooks thinks "the lives of young men can be improved more through loving attachment than through Peterson's joyless and graceless calls to self-sacrifice." The interview: Virtually every story about Peterson refers to this interview of him by Cathy Newman of Channel 4 News in Britain earlier this year. In it, he defends his view that men need to "grow the hell up," and the gist of much commentary is that Peterson came up against a hostile interviewer and won convincingly. At the Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf has a detailed critique, faulting Newman for trying to "put words into the academic's mouth."

"Magical things are happening all around her—ornate sets, clever video displays, fiery dancing—but Ms. Spears is there mostly to activate memories, to be a souvenir for the eyes. Rarely did the voice booming out over the speakers appear to be coming directly from Ms. Spears’s mouth. Always a notch or three less committed than her backup dancers, she was at times downright listless." But everything about the production other than Britney herself "is splashy and top volume," including the "vibrant" costumes, "powerful" choreography, and "imposing" set design. The show was certainly cheesy, writes Sophie Schillaci at MTV, and "if you're looking for a powerhouse vocal performance in your Vegas entertainment," you'd be better served by Celine Dion. "But Britney fans will find no better show on the strip than Piece of Me," a "larger-than-life production" that will get the audience on its feet, and is more a nostalgic "greatest hits marathon" than a look forward. On Celebuzz, Jason Marshall offers up the pros and cons of the show. Among the highlights: Britney can still dance (in sneakers); her hair and costumes (there are "at least seven costume changes," including three wigs and a pair of huge angel wings) are fantastic; the 24-song set list is "amazing" and will have you singing along; the set is "awesome"; and the merch is "pretty incredible." Among the lowlights: Only the expensive seats include a close-up view of Britney (the huge screens don't actually show what's happening onstage); most of the songs have been shortened; Spears barely addresses the audience or gets personal; and oh yeah, she doesn't "appear to be singing throughout a lot of the show," though the pre-recorded remixes are still "all sorts of awesome." Similarly, Rolling Stone rounds up the "5 best and 5 saddest" moments from the show. Caryn Ganz concludes, "Viewed through a lens of diminished expectations ... Britney: Piece of Me is an entertaining tour through the 32-year-old star's nearly 15-year recording career" and features "flashes of greatness" ... as well as a few "true bummers." Time offers up some of the best videos from the event. "Who cares if Britney doesn’t actually sing during her show?" writes Courtney Subramanian. "What she gives in pumped-up dance moves and dazzling costume changes is a huge leap forward from her disastrous going-through-the-motions 2007 VMA performance."

Meanwhile, crews working to contain any environmental damage got good news from the Coast Guard this morning: The rig does not appear to be leaking oil from the ocean floor, the AP reports. Another factor in crews' favor: The rig was in a deep section of the gulf, allowing sea water to dilute the residual oil that did spill during the explosion. "It won't have the same devastating effect as one on the beach," a marine biologist tells the Houston Chronicle. “I'm less worried about toxicity than annoying birds and animals with this slimy stuff.”

The 86-year-old former leader, who is often rumored to be dead or seriously ill, chatted with reporters and other voters in his first extended public outing since 2010, Reuters reports. Castro was stooped and spoke in a weak voice about issues including Hugo Chavez and his brother Raul's economic reforms. "The people are truly revolutionary, they have really sacrificed," Castro said, praising public participation in the elections. "We don't have to prove it, history will. Fifty years of the blockade and they haven't given in." Only Communist Party-selected candidates were on the ballot in the Cuban elections, which will send 612 delegates to the National Assembly, the BBC reports.

The statistic getting the most attention out of the new study in Nature Plants is that eight of the continent's 13 oldest baobabs have died since 2005 and five of the six largest have suffered significant collapses. The scientists can't say for sure what's going on, but they suspect that climate change—as in, higher temperatures and drought—is the primary culprit in the deaths throughout Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa, Botswana, and Zambia, reports the BBC. Baobabs grow in unusual ways, often with hollows, making it difficult to gauge precise ages, but the research team says the trees in the survey range in age from 1,000 to 2,500 years, reports NPR. “It is very surprising to visit monumental baobabs, with ages greater than a thousand to two thousand years, which seem to be in a good state of health, and to find them after several years fallen to the ground and dead,” study co-author Adrian Patrut of Babes-Bolyai University in Romania tells National Geographic. And it's no fluke, he adds. "Statistically, it is practically impossible that such a high number of large old baobabs die in such a short time frame due to natural causes." The stories note baobabs' iconic place in African history. In South Africa, one legendary baobab more than 1,000 years old grew to 111 feet and had a hollow so large that it functioned as a pub for two decades. The tree started to split in 2016 and collapsed completely the following year. (The Nazis' attempt to cloak its ship affected Norway's trees.)

"These songs of mine," Dylan told the MusiCares charity event, which was honoring him as person of the year, "they’re like mystery plays, the kind Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they’re on the fringes now." Dylan was feted by A-listers ranging from Bruce Springsteen to Jack White; former President Jimmy Carter saluted Dylan's "words on peace and human rights are much more incisive, much more powerful and much more permanent than those of any president of the United States." He thanked artists like Peter, Paul, and Mary for covering his songs, saying they "were like commercials. But I didn’t really mind that, because 50 years later my songs were used for commercials. So that was good, too." He threw Jimi Hendrix into that mix, notes Rolling Stone, saying, "He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and brought them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere, turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here." Of his work, he says "my songs didn’t just come out of thin air—I didn’t just make them up," adding, "If you sang 'John Henry' as many times as me ... you would have written 'How many roads must a man walk down,' too." And to his many critics: "Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day 1," he said. "Critics say I can’t sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don’t critics say the same thing about Tom Waits?" The Times notes that the event usually ends with a performance by the honoree, but Dylan slipped off into the night leaving Neil Young to perform "Blowin' in the Wind."

His uncontained tat (see a pic here) of a phoenix ascending out of the ashes has spurred exes Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez ("it's awful!") to dish on the matter, lots of Twitter buzz (and a parody handle), and even a New Yorker analysis. And Affleck himself finally addressed the issue, after apparently reading the latter piece. "@NewYorker I'm doing just fine," he tweeted Thursday. "Thick skin bolstered by garish tattoos." If you think he's being too hard on himself with the word "garish," take heart: It's likely sarcasm, as the New Yorker used that exact descriptor in its article. Or post-divorce Ben Affleck just has a decent sense of self-effacing humor.

Last year's inaugural sale kind of fizzled, with consumers largely unimpressed by what was on offer, notes AP. Amazon is promising better things this year. Related coverage: US News has a primer on what's happening, including so-called "lightning deals," fleeting promotions that will surface during the day. Forbes says some of the best deals are on Amazon's own products, including $30 off the $100 Amazon Fire TV, and Amazon Fire tablets starting at $33.33. NBC News has tips for shoppers, including this one: You can click on a deal quickly, reserve the item in your cart for 15 minutes, then check it out via a third-party price-tracking source and bail if it's not really such a great deal. Other advice is here. PCWorld assesses the tech and entertainment offers and likes the Samsung 4K UHD TV for $550, which is "practically a steal." The deals look "solid" so far, observes CNBC. The site collecting its own list of deals here that will be updated. Included is $500 off an HP 15.6-inch Business Notebook ($399). Mashable also has a rundown of its favorite deals so far.

That's the thinking behind Coco Loko, a new "snortable" chocolate powder billed as a legal way to get high, the Washington Post reports. The newfangled nose candy leaves snorters with a "euphoric" feeling "but also motivated to get things done," per founder Nick Anderson. He likens the buzz, which lasts for 30 minutes to an hour, to that of an energy drink. The 29-year-old Anderson, who runs the company Legal Lean, says he got the idea for Coco Loko a few months ago after hearing about a "chocolate-snorting trend" in Europe. Jezebel reports the fad may go back to 2015, when a Belgian chocolate-maker hawked a device that shoots chocolate powder up your nose. "At first, I was like, 'Is this a hoax?,'" Anderson tells the Post. "And then I tried it and it was like, OK, this is the future right here." So Anderson pumped in $10,000 of his own cash into creating his own "raw cacao snuff." A 10-serving tin of Coco Loko costs $19.99 on the company website. The product is also spiked with ginkgo biloba, taurine, and guarana, all common ingredients in energy drinks. The powder is not FDA approved, and doctors seem perplexed by it. "No one's studied what happens if you inhale chocolate into your nose," one doc tells the Post. ABC10 notes that stuffing foreign substances up your schnoz could hurt mucous membranes, which keep bacteria and particles from entering the nose, among other issues. So does it work? Reviews on message boards are all over the place, with one saying, "All I felt was drowsy," per the Post. (Nearly half of us aren't sure where chocolate milk comes from.)

The famous Italian tower is doing just fine more than 800 years after it first started tilting during construction, according to a group that's been monitoring the 190-foot Tuscan monument since 2001. It's in better condition now than predicted by an international committee of researchers, reports ANSA. Indeed, the tower has lost 1.5 inches of its tilt over the past two decades—it was closed in 1990 because its tilt became too considerable, per Popular Science—with "oscillations now varying at the average of 1/2 millimeter a year," says Nunziante Squeglia, a professor of geotechnics at the University of Pisa. "What counts the most is the stability of the bell tower, which is better than expected," adds Squeglia, who credits work to stabilize the structure on soft soil. A study published in May actually pointed out the importance of that soil in keeping Pisa's landmark upright. Essentially, the soft soil modifies ground vibrations—not uncommon in Italy, which sits on multiple fault lines—to prevent much motion in the tower, which has emerged undamaged from at least four strong earthquakes since 1280. "Ironically, the very same soil that caused the leaning instability and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse, can be credited for helping it survive these seismic events," an engineer says in a release. (Still, you may be underwhelmed.)

When Herman Cain was asked about his earlier comments that he wouldn’t allow a Muslim in his administration, or that they should take an extra loyalty oath, Gingrich jumped in with an anecdote about the Times Square bomber, Think Progress notes. Asked why he’d violated his oath to the US, the bomber, in Newt’s telling, replied, “You’re my enemy. I lied.” “If you’re not prepared to be loyal to the United States, you will not serve in my administration, period,” Newt continued. “We did this in dealing with the Nazis and we did this in dealing with the communists.” Muslim groups were outraged, and political analysts were perplexed. “Either he is doing this for political purposes to distract people from a campaign in disarray, which is bad, or he actually believes it, which is scary,” ex-Bush strategist Matthew Dowd tells ABC.

TJ Oshie rode the subway to the DC arena for Game 4 with fellow player Matt Niskanen, just as they did for Game 3. But Oshie's card came up 35 cents short as he was exiting the station, reports Fox5 DC. As he stood in line to add money, a Metro employee let him through. "I don't know how much that ride was, but I owe you big time," Oshie said later, per USA Today. A few hours after his subway ride, Oshie scored the first goal of the game and later added two assists in Washington's 6-2 win. The Caps now lead the best-of-seven series 3-1, with Game 5 on Thursday night in Vegas. One fan posted a photo of Oshie and Niskanen on the subway.

And thanks to her adoptive mom's efforts, the Sith lord was there Friday in a Wilmington, Del., courtroom, as were a slew of Stormtroopers, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and even a family court judge dressed up like Princess Leia as the Star Wars theme song played, People reports. "I wanted this day to be everything she ever wanted," new mom Deanna Pedicone tells WPVI. "It's only once in a lifetime that she'll be adopted." The News Journal details the mother and daughter's path to becoming a family, starting when the unmarried Pedicone started out as a foster parent a few years ago. Just two weeks after getting licensed in November 2013, a nearly 2-year-old Zoe was placed with her. Their bond grew so great that Pedicone decided to pursue adoption, and her application was approved a few months ago. She says she was inspired to make her daughter's Star Wars-themed dream come true by a video of another little girl's adoption that featured a bevy of princesses. Pedicone recruited a local Star Wars costuming group and filled Judge Barbara Crowell in on her plans, and Crowell was happy to oblige, even dressing up as Leia Organa and touching Zoe's head with a lightsaber as she announced her official name change. Now Pedicone says she and Zoe can concentrate on their future together, something they were never fully able to do when Zoe was her foster child. "There are no more strings. … No more case workers. No more attorneys. It is just us," she says. (Carrie Fisher finished filming the next Star Wars movie before her death this week.)

But it wasn't just that Brian Holloway was upset by the $20,000 in damage; his main concern was that he wasn't invited. His 19-year-old son spotted tweets about the party and told Holloway, who watched it unfold—by way of tweets and Twitter photos—from his Florida home; one photo showed people standing on a table that the former Patriots offensive lineman bought with his Super Bowl XX bonus. And the kids weren't exactly secretive: The New York Daily News reports that some spray-painted their names on walls; others tweeted invites to the Aug. 31 party a full five days before it happened. Perhaps unsurprisingly, "It's not hard to identify who they were," says Holloway. "We've got 170 tweets. We have 200 to 220 names already confirmed today. And that data is all going to the sheriffs." That's not the only place the data is going: He has also been posting it to a website dubbed helpmesave300, in an effort to get the teens to come forward, take responsibility, and adjust their behavior. He also wants them to come back, only this time it's to clean up. "I believe that they can be turned around," he explains, per Fox Sports, which has photos from the party and its aftermath. "If we do nothing regarding these 300 students, we will have missed our chance to take a stand for their future."

During an interview on the Tavis Smiley show on PBS last week, Cumberbatch was asked about diversity in acting roles and said, "I think as far as colored actors go it gets really different in the UK, and a lot of my friends have had more opportunities here [in the US] than in the UK, and that's something that needs to change. Something's gone wrong. We're not representative enough in our culture of different races, and that really does need to step up apace." Of course, Cumberbatch was quickly called out for using the term "colored." Yesterday, he apologized, telling People he feels like a "complete fool." "I'm devastated to have caused offense by using this outmoded terminology," he said in a statement. "I offer my sincere apologies. I make no excuse for my being an idiot and know the damage is done. I can only hope this incident will highlight the need for correct usage of terminology that is accurate and inoffensive. The most shaming aspect of this for me is that I was talking about racial inequality in the performing arts in the UK and the need for rapid improvements in our industry when I used the term. ... While I am sorry to have offended people and to learn from my mistakes in such a public manner please be assured I have. I apologize again to anyone who I offended for this thoughtless use of inappropriate language about an issue which affects friends of mine and which I care about deeply."

You're obligated to reply to any petition that gets enough signatures on the "We the People" site—even the one to deport Piers Morgan over his gun-control stance. What do you do? Well, you could issue a statement that never uses the words "Piers," "Morgan," or "deport," which is what the White House has done, New York reports. Instead, Jay Carney tactfully addresses the principle at hand, in a post titled, "When Discussing the Second Amendment, Keep the First in Mind Too." President Obama, he assures us, believes in the right to bear arms, but he also believes in freedom of speech. "No one should be punished by the government simply because he or she expressed a view on the Second Amendment—or any other matter of public concern." He then posts a video of Obama's generic response to post-Sandy Hook gun petitions. (Click to watch a much more animated Piers Morgan video.)

In an earnings call yesterday, the company shared a lower-than-expected forecast for the quarter ending in December, but it also shared this tidbit: Members of its loyalty program will be able to use a planned mobile ordering and payment app to request delivery in select cities in late 2015, the Wall Street Journal reports. "Our version of e-commerce on steroids" will give "the ability to create a standing order of Starbucks delivered hot to your desk daily," Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said during the call. The app, which allows customers to order a drink for pickup and pay with their phones, will debut in Portland, Ore., next month, with the delivery feature coming later, NBC News reports.

Instead, he delivered “what was likely the most horrifically devastating keynote presentation in SXSW history,” Alissa Walker writes at Fast Company. Loads of audience members left halfway through, then furiously tweeted their displeasure. Many blamed buzzword-happy interviewer Umair Haque, who talked about his vacation, blog, and “generally himself.” But some of the blame has to fall on Williams. The CEO unveiled @Anywhere, a new feature that will allow sites to easily integrate Twitter content. “It’s a slick feature,” writes Nicholas Ciarelli of the Daily Beast, but “audience members were justified in being unimpressed. … One now gets the sense that Twitter is focusing too much on being awesome, instead of addressing the more difficult questions about the future of its business.

A gold hearse took Houston's body from the airport to a funeral home in her hometown of Newark, reports the BBC. Her family hopes to use the city's 18,000-capacity Prudential Center for a wake on Thursday, and a funeral on Friday, sources tell the New York Times. The viewing of the body is expected to last all day Thursday, but a New Jersey Devils game scheduled for Friday night may pose a logistical challenge to funeral arrangements, the source says. Houston's family is also considering holding a smaller ceremony at the New Hope Baptist Church, where the singer started her career in the choir. Mourners have left flowers and candles for Houston at the fence around the church, reports AP.

Their class-action lawsuit attacking the company for luring clueless children with "addictive," expensive game apps was recently given the go-ahead by a San Jose judge. Games are "highly addictive, designed deliberately to be so, and tend to compel children playing them to purchase large quantities of game currency, amounting to as much as $100 per purchase or more," according to court documents. The apps can often be downloaded for free, but kids can rack up big bills purchasing extra levels and items. "Smurfberries," for example, which serve as currency in the Smurfs game, sell in batches costing up to $59, notes MSNBC. Children are usually not required to provide credit card information, and the costs are automatically billed to parents' iTunes accounts. Apple was recently forced to change security settings on iPhones to block such charges. In one case, a 7-year-old British boy racked up a $2,000 bill on an iPad buying animals for the Tap Zoo game, reports the Daily Mail. Parents say that it's all part of a devious plan, while Apple has argued that it's easy for parents to block their children from making such charges.

That's according to a Oct. 17 report by the Department of the Interior's inspector general, which found the unnamed employee used a government-issued computer to visit some 9,000 adult video sites, including many associated with Russian websites containing malware. That malware, linked to ransomware attacks and designed to steal data from infected devices, infiltrated the USGS network at the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center in South Dakota, reports TechCrunch. Nextgov reports the employee no longer works at the agency. Their "extensive history of visiting adult pornography websites" clashed with rules prohibiting the use of government networks to view pornography, agreed upon "several years prior to detection," the report notes. The employee also broke rules against connecting unauthorized devices to the computer. Videos were saved to a USB drive, and a personal Android cellphone also infected with malware, per the BBC. TechCrunch reports there were no threats to national security as the EROS Center, a satellite imaging facility monitoring land surface, doesn't operate classified networks. Still, auditors recommend USGS enforce blacklists of banned websites and do more to stop employees from connecting personal devices to government computers.

The 8,700-mile flight, set to begin in October, will take the full 18 hours heading west and 15 hours heading back to the States, making it the longest nonstop flight to or from the US. United already holds the current record for a US carrier—a 8,446-mile flight to Singapore out of San Francisco, per a press release—while Aussie airline Qantas tops that with a 8,576-mile route from Sydney to Dallas, per USA Today. (Qatar Airlines currently flies the world's longest route: 9,032 miles from New Zealand to Qatar.) The new United flight, which needs final approval by regulators, would also set a record for the longest regularly scheduled route on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Because of the drastic time difference created when crossing over the international date line in between the two countries, commuters heading toward Singapore will arrive there on paper two days later, while those heading east toward the US will actually feel like time-travelers: They'll take off from Singapore at 11am and "go back in time" to touch down in LA at 10:15am the same day. (United is probably better off sticking to the flight business instead of tweeting about chicken nuggets.)

"F**k you, Opioids," reads the headline of the post on the Brunswick Memorial Funeral Home's page. "What am I supposed to say when we get a call from someone telling me that a loved one has passed from an overdose? I’m sorry? Please accept my condolences?" writes Peter Kulbacki. "Yeah, that’s what I say, but you know what? My visceral response when I hang up the phone is F**K you opioids." Kulbacki, who describes himself as a "consummate professional" not normally prone to swearing, says there's a problem—particularly in his county. He recounts stories of police officers who have to return to the station for more Narcan mid-shift because they've already used the initial two doses they take on patrol with them, and families devastated by addiction turned fatal. "We have to stand and fight….as a community," the post concludes. "We have to beat this horrible monster." The post has gone viral, and Kulbacki tells ABC 7 he's received mostly positive feedback. He tells NJ 101.5 he felt he had to write about it after the "notable increase" in overdose deaths he's seen. He's been in the funeral business 40 years, and he tells Philly.com he hopes the conversation around his piece will lead to some solutions.

The ballistic missile went up about 3am Wednesday local time and flew east before coming down in the Sea of Japan. "We will take care of it," President Trump told reporters afterward, per CNBC, but he did not elaborate. Military analysts from the US and South Korea were still assessing the type and scope of the missile. More details and developments: An ICBM? One big question is whether it was a standard missile or one of the intercontinental variety capable of reaching the US. The answer wasn't immediately clear, but the initial assessment points to an ICBM, according to Pentagon spokesman Col Robert Manning, per Yonhap News Agency. Long flight: Early reports suggest the missile flew for about 50 minutes, which the Guardian reports would be a North Korean record. The Pentagon's Manning estimates it went about 620 miles, and it may have come down within 200 nautical miles of Japan's coast, reports the AP. There were conflicting reports on whether it actually flew over Japan, as previous missiles have done.

Hodel—who has long claimed his physician father killed 22-year-old Elizabeth Short, also known as the "Black Dahlia," along with several others—says George Hodel may have been trying to imitate the surrealist work of famous artist Man Ray, who was a family friend. As the Guardian puts it, "Two of Man Ray's photographs, Les Amoureux and Minotaur, do bear a chilling resemblance to Short's mutilated body." He may have wanted to create a "masterpiece, a crime so shocking and horrible it would endure, be immortalized through the annals of crime lore," says Steve. Short's body, found in a vacant lot in Los Angeles in 1947, was sliced in two in what is known as a hemicorporectomy, taught while George Hodel was in medical school (the Guardian details other gruesome details of the crime). George died in 1999 and was never charged with the crime, but police records show he was a suspect, and Steve details other potential clues he has uncovered: A handwriting expert found that letters the killer sent to police bore a resemblance to his dad's scrawl. Receipts also showed George Hodel bought bags of concrete just before Short's murder; bags of the same size and brand were found near Short's body. While police seem largely uninterested in Steve's evidence, "my judge and jury are the public," says Steve. (Click for more unsolved Hollywood murders.)

Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez has told Florida officials that the state's attempt to purge people it believes are noncitizens from the rolls needs to be cleared by the department to ensure it does not "endanger the ability of eligible US citizens to register to vote and maintain their voter registration," Talking Points Memo reports. Civil rights groups say Florida is using an inaccurate database that is removing eligible voters from the rolls. Florida says it has found 87 noncitizens on the rolls so far, though one person told he was a noncitizen turned out to be a Brooklyn-born WWII veteran, notes the Miami Herald. Florida's government has filed a federal lawsuit of its own, alleging that the Department of Homeland Security is illegally refusing to let the state access a federal database that would help it purge noncitizens from the rolls. "We can’t let the federal government delay our efforts to uphold the integrity of Florida elections any longer," Florida's secretary of state told reporters.

Lynn Redden is superintendent of the Onalaska Independent School District in the Piney Woods, about 75 miles north of Houston. The Chronicle reports Redden was referring to the last play of Sunday's game in which Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson held the ball as time expired. Later Tuesday, the school district posted a notice on its website that the school board would have a special meeting on Saturday to discuss Redden's contract, reports the AP. The board also released a statement to the Chronicle that read: "Onalaska ISD regrets that an inappropriate comment has been attributed to the district's superintendent. The OISD does not condone negative comments or actions against any race. The district values every individual and therefore the district will take the appropriate measures to address the situation expeditiously and completely." In an interview with the Chronicle, Redden said he regrets posting what he thought was a private comment; he said he deleted it as soon as he realized it was public. Redden said he based the comment on what he called the "limited success" of black quarterbacks in the NFL.

The trio face up to 30 years each in prison, but won't know their fate until later today, reports Oak Ridge Today. Supporters in the courtroom sang "Love, love, love, love. People, we are made for love," as nun Megan Rice, Michael R. Walli, 64, and Greg Boertje-Obed, 57, were taken into custody, the Washington Post reports. The three activists cut through four chain fences and spray-painted biblical messages on the walls of the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where most of the country's weapons-grade uranium is stored. "Our intent was to bring healing and forgiveness and love," said Rice, but prosecutors say they caused $8,532 of damage to property and also threatened national defense. "Three senior citizens showing up with backpacks is a threat to the United States of America?” questioned their defense attorney. "That threatens us? I don’t think so ...

"That was wrong," says the IRS official in charge of tax-exempt groups. "That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. The IRS would like to apologize for that." She swears it wasn't politically motivated, but conservatives such as Mitch McConnell are demanding a fuller accounting, and various Tea Party groups want resignations to follow. Conservative groups have been complaining for more than a year of unfair treatment by the IRS, reports the Washington Post. The back story here is that scores of political groups filed for nonprofit status last year, a distinction that puts them under the authority of the IRS instead of the Federal Election Commission, reports Politico. (One of the advantages is that they can hide donors.) The IRS agents—described as "career employees" working out of Cincinnati who got assigned to look into the increase in applications—were investigating to see whether such groups were dabbling too much in politics to qualify as nonprofits. The agency issued another statement today saying it should have done a "better job of handling the influx of advocacy applications. Mistakes were made initially, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan rationale.”

"Amen, Brother" was an instrumental B-side to a Grammy-winning hit called "Color Him Father," and it contains six seconds of drumming that have been sampled on more than 1,500 tracks, the BBC reports, pointing to data from whosampled.com. Among those who have used the beat are big names like David Bowie, Oasis, NWA, Nine Inch Nails, and Salt-N-Pepa, not to mention those behind the Futurama theme song, Rolling Stone reports. But the Winstons never received any royalties for the usage. The sampling of what's known as the "Amen Break" began in the 1980s, and at the time, the legal rules surrounding it weren't clear. The drummer who played the beat, one GC Coleman, died homeless in 2006 in Atlanta, and frontman Richard Spencer doesn't think Coleman was aware of the song's influence. But there's something of a happy ending to all this: British musicians have started an online fund to repay Spencer for the band's work, and they've collected more than $32,000 on GoFundMe. "If you have ever written or sold any music with the amen break, or even just enjoyed one of the countless hundreds and hundreds of tunes that contain … please donate towards the good cause," the campaign requests.

The New York Times, meanwhile, scored an interview with the 24-year-old escort at the heart of the case, the one whose argument with an agent over payment—"I tell him, 'Baby, my cash money'"—sparked the whole mess. Among the details: She says a group of US men approached her and a friend at a disco, and she agreed to accompany one guy back to his hotel for $800. The agents were "very discreet" and never said they were with the president. The next morning, her client said he didn't remember the deal, gave her $30, and ordered her from the room. She made a scene in the hallway, and other Americans got her about $225, so she left. By then, however, hotel security and local cops were on the scene.

The scenario: Cruise as expected Tuesday in New Hampshire, then rack up wins in South Carolina on Jan. 21 and in Florida on Jan. 31. "If Romney wins the first four states, he’ll be the de facto nominee of the party,” says former John McCain campaign strategist Steve Schmidt. (The story quotes others, also unaffiliated with the Romney camp, saying much the same.) Toward that end, the campaign is rolling out big money and big endorsements in South Carolina, where polls have him in front—Time/CNN has him up 37% to 19% on Santorum, though Rasmussen sees a narrower lead. The campaign—which is publicly dismissing talk of a quick lockdown of the nomination—also has begun a heavy ad blitz in Florida.

A Change.org petition urging the Commission on Presidential Debates to have the former Daily Show host moderate one of the three major debates ahead of the general election is picking up steam and now has more than 130,000 signatures, CNN reports. Petition starter Mariel Waters says Stewart is a trusted and popular figure who has interviewed 15 heads of state and "scores of other political leaders from this country and around the world." "Many in the US believe Jon Stewart shares their worldview and values," the petition states, citing a Reuters poll that found more than 50% of Americans agree with him on "some or most" issues. Martin O'Malley, who would like to see the Democrats have more than six presidential debates, announced on Twitter last night that he has signed the petition. An O'Malley spokeswoman tells the Washington Post that the former Maryland governor is a Daily Show fan and that a "Jon Stewart-moderated debate would be more informative than the Trump-dominated GOP sideshow that's going unanswered, so he's game."

But such security success doesn't come without a price: Hackers know who Krebs is, writes Nicole Perlroth in the New York Times, and they haven't hesitated to go after him. Krebs got interested in cybersecurity after being a victim of a worm in 2001. A few years later, he launched a blog at the Post. Eventually, they asked him to expand its focus beyond cybercrime. He refused, was let go, and started a site of his own. Now he has an international reputation. In some cases, cybercriminals—usually based in Eastern Europe—offer him the inside scoop on their competitors. Other times, they target him for some fairly serious "pranks." One day, a SWAT team appeared outside his house; police had received a fake report of a murder. In another case, heroin was sent to Krebs' house; again, someone reported the false crime to police. Meanwhile, Krebs' identity is often stolen, and hackers have paid for his cable—using stolen credit cards. "The work that (Krebs has) done exposing Eastern European hackers has been seminal," says another cybersecurity expert. "But Brian needs a bodyguard." Click for the full profile.

Now imagine that it lingers for 18 years, and you'll have a sense of Illinois resident Nadia Campbell's misery. "I used to wake up at night literally every hour to blow my nose because there was so much congestion and difficulty breathing," the 38-year-old tells Loyola Medicine. "I never got a restful night's sleep." She visited five specialists and had three surgeries over the years, all to no avail—until doctors at Loyola University's health system figured out the problem, reports ABC News. It was Samter’s triad, a rare condition recognized fairly recently that involves a combination of asthma, nasal polyps, and sensitivity to aspirin. "My patients typically come in carrying a thick folder of medical records because they have tried for a long time to find a cure for their illness," says the doctor who successfully treated Campbell. "Most feel constant fatigue and facial pain and have had recurring bouts of sinusitis." Once the diagnosis was made, doctors surgically removed the polyps, opened up Campbell's nasal passages, desensitized her to aspirin, and weaned her off the steroid medications she'd been taking for years. Result? "I woke up and could smell breakfast and could taste coffee," says Campbell. "I didn't need to make sure I was carrying loads of tissues, because my nose was not running or irritated for the first time ever." (A paralyzed man's nose recently helped him walk again.)

The report seen by the Herald-Tribune states that 14-year-old Jabez Spann was leaving a home in Sarasota on Aug. 28 at the same time three men chased Travis Combs, 31, into a vacant lot and shot him dead. The police document states that Spann said: "Oh my God. Y'all shot him." Spann, who attended a candlelit vigil for Combs, was last seen at a family barbecue Sept. 4, per ABC 7. A $25,000 reward is being offered for information on his whereabouts, and relatives have been pleading for help finding the boy and getting "closure." The Combs murder is still unsolved. The police document states that Lucille Tillery, the teen's grandmother and guardian, told investigators that 55-year-old Reginald Parker said he witnessed the murder and saw Spann leave the home, per ABC 7. Parker changed his story after being jailed for an unrelated matter and was charged as an accessory to the Combs murder for allegedly impeding the investigation. In a strange twist, Sarasota Mayor Shelli Freeland Eddie—acting as a private attorney—intervened in late September after police became aware that a local pastor might have information about the Combs murder, reports the Herald Tribune. Records state that Freeland Eddie wrote to police and prosecutors, saying pastor Kelvin Lumpkin would invoke "pastoral privilege" and refuse to answer any questions from investigators.

An upper jawbone belonging to a human relative who lived in what is now Tanzania almost 2 million years ago has been discovered with scratches on its still-intact teeth, and scientists have a clear idea about how they were made: by a stone tool held in the Homo habilis individual's right hand. Why is that significant? Well, it represents the earliest known evidence of right-handedness among human relatives. The next oldest comes from the 500,000-year-old teeth of a Homo heidelbergensis individual, per National Geographic. Evidence also suggests Neanderthals were predominantly right-handed. In the case of Homo habilis, archaeologists think the teeth nicks came about thusly: The individual would have a piece of meat clenched in his teeth, and while he stretched it out with one hand, he used the other, dominant, hand, to cut it with a stone, explains Live Science. (It provides a graphic of what this looks like.) Occasionally, the stone would slip, and the direction of the resulting nicks suggests the right hand was the one used, a theory backed up in modern experiments. Few studies have analyzed Homo habilis teeth for such marks, but study author David Frayer of the University of Kansas hopes his research will encourage others to do just that. The discovery may also offer insights about when language first appeared since "language, handedness, brain laterality ... are all interrelated," he tells Mashable. (This is the oldest evidence of human cancer.)

The village in Maharashtra has been chosen for the launch of India's ambitious project to collect fingerprints and iris scans from all of its 1.2 billion people—and assign them unique 12-digit ID numbers. Experts of Indian origin from around the world have been recruited to help with the massive project, the Wall Street Journal reports. Registration is voluntary for now but the government, aiming to reduce fraud, plans to tie the biometric IDs to provision of social services. The project's backers say it will improve the lot of India's poor, who often have no documents to prove who they are. Some question whether India's less-than-reliable Internet infrastructure can handle that much data, but its creators promise that privacy will be strictly protected. Once the data reach central servers, "it never leaves, its like a black hole," the project's architect tells the Times of India.

In a tweet late Friday—just before tweeting that he would be taking a break from Twitter—Musk responded to a question about his ill-fated tweet claiming he would take the company private, which resulted in $40 million in SEC fines and him stepping down as company chairman, reports Reuters. "Worth It," he tweeted. Given that the ink is barely dry on the SEC fines, Gizmodo thinks that Musk's plan to take a break from "(firing) off word salad at all hours of the day and night" for a while "doesn’t seem like such a bad long-term plan."

The reason for the latter, as spelled out in Vox, is an apparent rising concern over labor issues and Amazon's monopolistic ways. But while Palus applauds those making a statement by ditching Prime, she's not about to cast judgment on those who won't. "It’s simply not a step that everyone can take, and that’s not just because people are unwilling to forgo convenience," she writes. "It’s easy to forget, because everyone has to do it and it’s often pleasurable, but shopping is labor." Prime, especially for those struggling to make ends meet, can be "a Band-Aid, helping them save money and time," writes Palus. She talks to several people who explain why they don't feel they can give it up, including a young couple who have giant boxes of diapers delivered to their second-floor condo at a discount of 20%. She suggests that people like this who still want to support the Amazon protests can cut back in smaller ways, like not taking part in additional services such as same-day delivery. And they can also be vocal about their concerns. "Small actions, if broadcast to a social network and in turn, to politicians, can help spur that change." Read the full piece.

Some 25 students started Jackson County Spelling Bee's championship round on Saturday, but after just 19 rounds, 11-year old Sophia Hoffman and Kush Sharma, 13, were the only two left standing for what an organizer says was a "legendary" showdown, the Kansas City Star reports. They spelled words including "scherzo,” "fantoccini," and "intaglio" correctly before the words ran out and organizers decided to halt the contest instead of plucking random words from the dictionary, reports the AP. The showdown will resume on March 8, and it will be a tougher challenge for both contestants: They will have to spell words taken anywhere from the Merriam-Webster dictionary's 1,664 page instead of from the Scripps-approved list of 300 words. The winner will move on to the National Spelling Bee in May.

John Constantino "was a loving father and husband," and his death "was not a political act or statement," the 64-year-old's family said in a statement, the AP reports. The family would like to acknowledge "the heroism of the paramedics and bystanders who attempted to save his life," the statement says. The family's lawyer says he is "not aware of any anti-government statements made by him or any ill will he may have had against the government." His neighbors say they are baffled by the death of the man they describe as friendly and happy. He had complained about the government to neighbors—though only in terms that many ordinary Americans would agree with. "He said they were a waste of time, effort, and money," one neighbor tells the New York Daily News. "He said to me, 'They’re no good. They don’t look out for us and they don’t care about anything but their own pockets.'"

The investigation, however, is suspended and not closed in case Jackie wants to cooperate further in the future. The lack of evidence "doesn't mean something terrible didn't happen," said the police chief.

Three witnesses related to the victim say Jonathan Sanders was riding a horse-drawn buggy in Stonewall when he made a comment to officer Kevin Herrington, who had pulled over a driver. He said something like, "Why don't you leave that man alone?" the lawyer tells the Guardian. The driver who was pulled over says he then heard Herrington say, "I'm going to get that n*****," before confronting an unarmed Sanders. Police say there was "a fight," while witnesses say Sanders was choked with a head-mounted light he'd been wearing and twice uttered, "I can't breathe." A witness offered to perform CPR, but Herrington reportedly refused. Medical examiners have ruled Sanders' death a homicide by asphyxiation. "We believe there is probable cause for a prosecution," says the lawyer. Meanwhile a second death in police custody in Texas has family and friends demanding justice. Sandra Bland, 28—a civil rights activist, per NBC News—was arrested for assault during a traffic stop last Friday and booked at Waller County Jail. Officials say they spoke with Bland at 8am Monday—the day she was to be released on $5,000 bond—but returned to find her dead in her cell. The Chicago Tribune reports her death was ruled a suicide by hanging, but relatives say that's "totally absurd" since she had "a thirst for life" and was about to start a new job. "I will admit it is strange someone who had everything going for her would have taken her own life," a district attorney tells KPRC. "That's why it's very important a thorough investigation is done and that we get a good picture of what Ms. Bland was going through the last four or five days of her life." People are debating the case with hashtags #JusticeForSandy and #WhatHappenedToSandyBland, while an online petition calls for the DOJ to intervene.

Nevertheless, he says that the US is reviewing whether to throw Pyongyang back on the list of state sponsors of terror. "I'll wait to review what the findings are," he says. That could be dicey: The AP notes that it requires the State Department to blame Korea for terror under "a definition that traditionally has referred to violent, physical attacks rather than hacking." North Korea had spent two decades on the list until the Bush administration removed it in 2008; only Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria remain. Other highlights from the interview this morning on State of the Union: On Sony's decision to pull the plug on The Interview: "I was pretty sympathetic to the fact that they have business considerations that they got to make. Had they talked to me directly about this decision, I might have called the movie theater chains and distributors and asked them what the story was." On setting a dangerous precedent: If "a dictator in another country can disrupt through cyber, a company's distribution chain or its products, and as a consequence we start censoring ourselves, that's a problem. ... This is a matter of setting a tone and being very clear that we're not going to be intimidated by some cyberhackers. And I expect all of us to remember that and operate on that basis going forward." Because it doesn't stop there: "And it's a problem not just for the entertainment industry, it's a problem for the news industry. CNN has done critical stories about North Korea.

A jury this summer found that Samsung had knowingly infringed on Apple's patents, but that's not sufficient grounds for a ban, Judge Lucy Koh says. Instead, Apple would have to prove "irreparable harm" by demonstrating that customers were choosing specific Samsung devices over the Cupertino company's own, Forbes reports. Koh also noted that just "a small fraction" of Apple's features suffered infringement, and "it does not follow that entire products must be forever banned from the market," Reuters reports. Apple is likely to appeal the move, Forbes notes. In better news for the US firm, Koh nixed Samsung's call for a new trial over jury bias—leaving the $1.05 billion ruling in place, Mashable notes. Meanwhile, Samsung is ditching its bids for injunctions against Apple in Europe, where the European Commission in January planned an antitrust probe over Samsung patents. "We strongly believe it is better when companies compete fairly in the marketplace, rather than in court," the company said in a statement to the Verge.

Microsoft has just released the public beta version of a new Project Oxford tool that uses artificial intelligence to recognize "eight core emotional states" on people's faces in photographs. If you express anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or surprise and you show it, the tool will catch on, reports Microsoft; the eighth state it registers is "neutral." Project Oxford has been working on machine-based learning for a while now, reports Ars Technica. There's even a Movember-related sub-service, MyMoustache.net, through which users can upload images of their mustaches and get rated. Several users are already tweeting out the results of their own photos or those of famous people, reports the New York Daily News. For instance, one image of Hitler is calculated as mostly neutral (0.82048) but with smaller amounts of sadness (0.10757) and anger (0.07123) and trace amounts of contempt, disgust, fear, and surprise. The smiling cat owner next to him in the tweet, meanwhile, is 100% happy. Not all examples appear to get it exactly right, however; a forlorn-looking Keanu Reeves (aka "Sad Keanu") on a bench is only 0.01831 sad and actually 0.00035 happy, reports the Verge. (Still, it's looking better than Microsoft's age-guessing algorithm from earlier this year.)

Of course, it wasn't until the Daily Mail got hold of it that the story took off, with this slightly revised headline: "Bad news for 220-mile high club: Researchers find sex in space could lead to life-threatening illnesses." This led to a spate of sex-in-space-can-kill-you stories. So what gives? It turns out that amorous space travelers probably don't have to worry—unless they're having sex for the specific purpose of producing offspring, explains Daily Kos. Essentially, the researchers studied plant sex in zero gravity and found big problems in the reproduction process related to how cells communicate with each other. They did not draw any conclusions about human sex, but the possibility of similar problems affecting people can't be ruled out yet, says LiveScience. "What does this mean?" asks Daily Kos. "It means we may not be able to colonize the Moon or Mars anytime soon, not until we lick many, many problems." But at least the couple who might be blasting off to Mars should be able to ... unwind.

The artist posted a satirical travel video inviting the world to visit Gaza to see all it has to offer, using images of its destruction to make the point, reports the Daily Dot. "The locals like it so much they never leave," reads one caption, quickly followed by, "(Because they’re not allowed to).” The video also shows new Banksy artworks in Gaza, including one of a giant cat seemingly playing with a ball of scrap metal. The caption on the artist's site explains that "I wanted to highlight the destruction in Gaza by posting photos on my website—but on the internet people only look at pictures of kittens." A publicist for Banksy gave the New York Times a quote attributed to the artist about the Gaza visit: “I don’t want to take sides. But when you see entire suburban neighborhoods reduced to rubble with no hope of a future—what you’re really looking at is a vast outdoor recruitment center for terrorists. And we should probably address this for all our sakes.” The artist's identity remains a mystery, with various theories suggesting Banksy is a man, a woman, or a collective of artists.

Blamed by some Instagram followers for ex-boyfriend Mac Miller's death on Friday, the 25-year-old disabled comments on her social media feed, reports People. Commenters hurled lowballs like "You lowkey evil," "Damn u killed the homie," and "I HOPE YOURE [sic] HAPPY WITH PETE [Davidson]," according to a tweet from Pop Crave. Grande has kept mum about the rapper's death, posting only a quick video of her UK hotel room with the words, "Bye London." The "No Tears Left to Cry" singer has been down this road before, when Miller was arrested in May for a DUI following his breakup with Grande. Naturally, some blamed her for his behavior. "I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be," she wrote on Twitter at the time. "I have cared for him and tried to support his sobriety and prayed for his balance for years (and always will of course) but shaming/blaming women for a man's inability to keep his s— together is a very major problem." Miller blamed himself for the DUI, per People, but that didn't stop some from criticizing Grande this time around. Now it seems the Twitterverse is on her side: "I hope Ariana has a strong support systems [sic] because the locals are intent on blaming her for something she has no business being blamed for ... AGAIN," reads a sample tweet. "Wishing you nothing but peace and strength." Miller died of a suspected drug overdose.

The Pentagon is toying with the idea of turning Tinian and Pagan—small US territories in the Northern Mariana Islands—into a place to stage war 16 weeks a year. What locals (who are US citizens) think: Pagan's mayor says the people are 100% against the move, which some equate to an "invasion," the Guardian reports. While Pagan has been uninhabited since a 1981 volcanic eruption, mayor Jerome Aldan says about 50 families aim to return to the 10-mile-long stretch of land. Tinian's 3,000 residents—some of whom own land already leased to the military—could be forced onto a 10-square-mile area. And the plan, which could be put into action by 2017, doesn't just affect people. Biologist Mike Hadfield describes Pagan as a "biological treasure trove" boasting rare fruit bats and tree snails. A rep for the Marine Corps in the Pacific told the Los Angeles Times last month, "We would protect it like it was our own." (Hadfield's response: "Anyone who believes the US Marines and Navy when they say they'll leave the place better than they found it must be slightly crazy.") The weeks of war games could see major amphibious assaults, ground maneuvers, and the placement of bombing targets on Mt. Pagan. Why here? The next decade will see thousands of Marines relocated to Guam from Okinawa; the Pentagon is scrambling for training sites in the region. Pagan is just 330 miles north of Guam and has been IDed as having beaches big enough for sizable amphibious assaults—though the Times points out the Marines haven't staged such an assault in a combat capacity since 1950. A Change.org petition against the plan has garnered more than 110,000 signatures.

The legislation would boost the debt ceiling by $1 trillion, the Washington Post reports—though Dems say in order to avoid default, they might OK a short-term solution instead, even if it lasts just weeks. Politico, however, reports a divide between top Senate Democrats and the White House, with the former frustrated that the administration is showing flexibility. Though the administration is now distancing itself from a short-term plan, senators fear the president may be inching closer to negotiating with Republicans over the default risk. That risk is growing, with experts telling the Hill that the "drop-dead date" to raise the ceiling is, perhaps appropriately, Halloween. "The one thing we know for sure is that by Nov. 1, they will be out of money," says a Goldman Sachs analyst. That's when $67 billion in Social Security, Medicare, military, and other payments are due. Meanwhile, lawmakers are working on sending back payments to furloughed workers—but even that is running into problems. After the House unanimously passed a measure to do so, Republican Sen. John Cornyn warned that it was "premature to be dealing with that until we deal with the underlying problem," Roll Call reports. Senate Dems plan an up-or-down vote that aides say is likely to get the measure through, the Post notes. Some 70% of Americans disapprove of the GOP's budget tactics, a Post-ABC News poll finds; 61% disapprove of congressional Democrats' handling of the situation, while Obama's disapproval rating is at 51%. His approval rating, however, climbed from 41% to 45% in the past week.

That combination has yielded neighbor vs. neighbor lawsuits in the Stoney Hollow neighborhood of Plano, Texas. It all started with the placement of a playhouse with an attached swingset in the side yard of Kelly and Andrew Counts' home, CBS DFW reports. In fact, one of the reasons the family chose the home in 2014 was that it had a concrete patio ideal for such a structure, Kelly Counts tells the Dallas Morning News. Next-door neighbors Irving and Anita Ward, who have declined to comment on the situation, disagreed. The Wards complained to the neighborhood homeowners association that the structure detracted from their "tranquil quality of life" and produced "noise issues as well as visibility issues for them and their pets," per HOA minutes obtained by CBS. The city also fielded a complaint regarding the location of the structure in relation to the property line; the family removed part of the playhouse roof to appease the city, and the HOA signed off on the structure. That's when, according to the Counts, the Wards began blasting the music when her four kids, ages 2 to 10, played outside. "I don't feel comfortable in my own backyard," she tells CBS. Counts says the Wards wouldn't have a conversation about the issue, so she and her husband filed a civil suit in October, FOX 4 reports. The music stopped—and then the Wards in December sued the Countses, "alleging loud and obnoxious noise," per the Morning News, and claiming they and their property have been damaged; they want the structure taken down. The parties will be in court this month and next. (This woman, bothered by noisy neighborhood kids, allegedly made a darker move.)

A lawmaker from Wisconsin says she wants wealthy Americans to get the same treatment before they can enjoy generous tax deductions, Yahoo News reports. Rep. Gwen Moore's "Top 1% Accountability Act of 2016" would require taxpayers with itemized deductions exceeding $150,000 to submit a clean drug test, according to a press release. If they refuse, they can take the lower standard deduction. "It is my sincere hope that my bill will help eradicate the stigma associated with poverty and engage the American public in a substantive dialogue regarding the struggles of working- and middle-class families," Moor says. According to the congresswomen, per the Guardian, the government spends $81 billion on poverty programs, while taxing capital gains at a lower rate than income costs the government $93 billion. "We might really save some money by drug-testing folks on Wall Street, who might have a little cocaine before they get their deal done," Moore tells the Guardian. NPR calls her bill an "implicit counterpunch" to welfare drug testing laws backed by Republicans. Some 15 states have passed laws to that require people who receive state welfare benefits to take drug tests. Among them are Florida, Michigan, and Moore's own Wisconsin, which also requires drug tests for people in the federal SNAP food stamp program. (The feds have said that's a no-no.) Supporters say drug testing saves money and acts as an incentive to keep people clean. Critics say drug tests are a cure for a problem that doesn't exist, citing stats from Florida that just 2% of welfare recipients failed drug tests and 2% declined to take the test.

Now Exeter University in South West England has apologized after sending a mass email to staff and students quoting former general Erwin Rommel, USA Today reports. "One cannot permit unique opportunities to slip by for the sake of trifles," reads the quote, apparently spoken by the general in his North African campaigns against British troops, per the BBC. Seems the June 4 email aimed to inspire students to seek out career options. A university spokesman blamed a staff member who didn't recognize Rommel's name. "A member of staff used the public, free access website 'Quotefancy' to find a quotation for use as part of an internal email," says the spokesman. "Unfortunately, the staff member did not recognize the name attributed to the generated quote." (And to be fair, there is debate among historians about how much Rommel endorsed the Nazi regime.) The Exeter student newspaper the Falmouth Anchor, which broke the story, says "it is evident that there was no malicious intent in choosing the quote," but Fox News says the National Union of Students isn't taking it lightly. Jewish students feel "increasingly unsafe" at universities and avoid some schools over "fears of anti-Semitism," the group says, adding that "Exeter must take appropriate action to rectify the damage" and make sure "something like this will never happen again."

The Alpha Chi Omega has lost its status and been booted off the Pennsylvania campus until May 2020 at the earliest after being found responsible for hazing and other offenses, reports the Morning Call. In a blog post, the university says the dubious acts involved in December's "Road Rally" scavenger hunt may not have been "required for affiliation into the organization, but are clearly considered a rite of passage and a consistent part of membership." Alpha Chi Omega will be ordered to vacate its sorority house and the university says that by the time the sorority can resume operations on campus, all the current members will have graduated, breaking a link with the tradition, Lehigh Valley Live reports. "This incident was a significant, reprehensible event that the entire chapter was aware of and leadership endorsed," says the university blog post, which accuses sorority leadership of creating "a situation that occurred on and off campus involving morally questionable quests." Alpha Chi Omega, which cooperated with the investigation by turning over scavenger hunt lists, will be allowed to appeal the decision.

Fire officials say an electrical failure ignited the dried-out tree, causing a late-night blaze that engulfed the Annapolis-area home within a couple of minutes, the Baltimore Sun reports. Homeowners Don and Sandra Pyle and their four grandchildren—sisters Alexis and Kaitlyn Boone, 7 and 8, and their cousins Charlotte and Wesley Boone, 8 and 6—were sleeping in rooms connected to the main room and the fire would probably have blocked their escape routes, investigators say. "The fuel load from the Christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and what caused the fire to spread as quickly as it did," a county fire marshal told reporters, adding that it would "without a doubt" have made a difference if the home had a sprinkler system. Investigators say that the Pyles had a tradition of extending Christmas for their grandchildren, and left the tree "lit most of the time," WBAL reports. The final body was removed from the mansion's ruins earlier this week and the families issued a statement thanking the community and first responders, reports the New York Daily News. "Though we are grieving deeply, this has brought us some small sense of closure," they said.

This time, it was pictures of Reeva Steenkamp's head after she was shot that prompted the vomiting, the BBC reports. Police commander Schoombie van Rensburg described his arrival at the athlete's house following Steenkamp's death, the Telegraph reports. With paramedics on the scene and Steenkamp declared dead, "the body was covered with towels and black bags," van Rensburg said. Pistorius, who was in the kitchen, "was very emotional at that stage, and then I asked him what happened. He didn't answer. He was in tears." Van Rensburg added that Carice Stander, the daughter of the property manager, said Pistorius had called her and her father for help taking Steenkamp to the hospital. Stander and Pistorius had used the bags and towels to stop the blood, she said. The commander described following "the trail of blood up the stairs," where the bathroom door was locked. Photos showed a cricket bat and still-cocked gun on the scene, CNN reports.

While not explicitly detailing those mistakes, Brinker acknowledges that many people felt that "the swift reaction" to Komen's defunding of Planned Parenthood was "an indicator of something larger and more dangerous ... the feeling that women's health care is being sacrificed on the altar of political ideologies." "If I have learned nothing else from our experience of the past week," Brinker continues, "it is that we in women’s health organizations must be absolutely true to our core missions, and avoid even the appearance of bias or judgment." In response to Quinn's pointed observation that as "the face of the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation ... it is up to you, not a PR firm to get out in front" and do damage control, Brinker vows a return to Komen's basics—"the funding of cutting-edge science"—and says the group "must now rebuild the trust that so many want to have in us."

Their wedding date (reportedly) remains May 24, but sources told ETOnline they're getting married not in Paris as was originally reported, but in Florence, Italy—and now the mayor's office has confirmed it. A rep says they're getting hitched at the 16th-century Belvedere Fort, which they rented for $410,000, the AP reports. But don't count Paris out: The couple will host a pre-wedding dinner there first, then fly their guests to the ceremony location on private planes, ET's sources say. Why Florence? Maybe because baby North West was probably conceived there "among the Renaissance masterpieces," as Kanye recently told a Florence paper, Us reports. Meanwhile, sources tell Hollywood Life that, despite rumors to the contrary, Beyonce and Jay Z will attend the wedding—"especially now," the source says, to divert attention away from sister Solange fighting Jay in a hotel elevator. However, Vogue editor Anna Wintour "politely declined" her invitation, sources tell the Daily Mail. West probably isn't too upset, since he has Jay Z as his best man.

Umm Sayyaf, a 25-year-old Iraqi woman captured in the raid that killed Abu Sayyaf, is accused of taking part in the kidnapping of Mueller, who was "owned" and sexually abused by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, NBC News reports. Federal prosecutors filed charges Monday against Sayyaf, who was transferred to Iraqi Kurdish custody a few months after her capture and is currently in prison in Iraq. Sayyaf has been charged with providing support to ISIS, which authorities say contributed to Mueller's death in ISIS custody. According to court papers, Sayyaf and her husband sold and traded women to ISIS fighters, and she was in charge of the captives when her husband was away. The court papers state that Sayyaf threatened to kill Mueller and two Yazidi women she was being held with, calling them "infidels" and showing them gruesome ISIS propaganda videos. Mueller died a year ago, and the Guardian reports that the court papers offer new details about her captivity. The 26-year-old was captured by ISIS fighters in August 2013, on her second day in Syria, and was kept in prison until September 2014, when she was turned over to the Sayyafs, according to federal investigators.

The company yesterday announced it has projected it will lose $160 million to $190 million on flop The Lone Ranger, which earned just $29 million in the US and Canada in its opening weekend (you may or may not recall it was absolutely slaughtered by Despicable Me 2), the BBC reports. Disney's CEO acknowledged that "high-cost, tent-pole films" were a risk, but that the company still believes "the tent-pole strategy is a good strategy," Reuters reports. But others involved in the film have been less conciliatory in their response to the news, blaming critics for the box office failure, the Guardian reports. "I think the reviews were written seven to eight months before we released the film," says star Johnny Depp. "[The critics] had expectations that it must be a blockbuster. I don't have any expectations of that. I never do." "I think they were reviewing the budget, not reviewing the movie," says producer Jerry Bruckheimer. (That budget was $225 million, by the way.) Rolling Stone film critic Peter Travers offered an alternative explanation. "Why is The Lone Ranger such a huge flop at the box office?" he says. "Because the movie sucks, that's why."

A group called the Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan recently registered with the US Federal Election Commission as a super PAC, and while Ryan's press secretary initially only said the speaker was "flattered but not interested," his team is now taking things further. On Thursday, Ryan's political operation is sending the group a cease-and-desist letter, Reuters reports. The Committee's intent was to convince Ryan to jump into the presidential race, not a surprising mission considering how often Ryan's name has been mentioned by establishment Republicans seeking an alternative to Donald Trump. The group has been trying to get a million signatures on its online petition to draft Ryan into the race. The cease-and-desist letter tells the organization to stop giving any indication it is raising funds to assist with a hypothetical Ryan campaign, and says, "We believe the actions of your organization are not in compliance with federal law and may constitute fraudulent solicitation of funds." It was sent to the group's treasurer, but a spokesperson for the group tells Reuters it has not yet been received. "The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan is simply a patriotic effort to save our party and save our country," he adds.

Police in Romania say they arrested 40-year-old Marcel Lazar Lehel this morning at his home in Arad, reports Romania-Insider. Guccifer is probably best known in the US for hacking into the emails of the Bush family and showing the world George W. Bush's paintings (including one of himself in the shower.) Media reports in Romania say "US services" helped with the arrest. The Bush family was far from the only target. Think Colin Powell, Tina Brown, Steve Martin, Mariel Hemingway, the Rockefeller family, and Carl Bernstein, to name but a few. He "hacked everyone from high-level military officials to C-list actresses with equal gusto," notes the Washington Post. Guccifer even snagged the script for the finale of the fourth season of Downton Abbey well before it aired in the UK, the Smoking Gun reported earlier this month. He also got into the account of the head of Romania's intelligence service.

Telling his story to Mel Magazine, Dave says: "It hit, and I turned the 10 grand into 20. That started my bankroll. I dropped out of school the next day and began betting on sports for a living." That high tolerance for risk is what led Vegas Dave to his current business of placing big bets on longshot sports results—and business is booming. In 2015, he won $2.5 million after betting $140,000 on the Kansas City Royals to win the World Series, a story that was enthusiastically reported in the local Las Vegas Sun. He placed the bet one week into the season, at 30-1 odds, and the payout is the "largest futures bet win in sports gambling history," Mel Magazine notes. Oancea had to spread the bet around to 15 different Las Vegas casinos, because after winning big with sports futures bets before, no casino would allow him to place such a large bet in one go. He's banned from Westgate, Vegas' biggest sports book, and the MGM Grand, and he's limited at several other casinos. "Vegas loves losers but hates winners," he says. Dave believes his win will likely never be replicated in sports betting, because no one else puts down so much money at such long odds. He does lose sometimes—for instance, his World Series pick this year was the Texas Rangers, who were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs—but he points out that even in that case, he's up overall on the Rangers this season, because he won a million bucks on a $300,000 bet that they would win their division.

The huge blast early in central Athens this morning shattered windows at the bank and at buildings up to 700 feet away but didn't cause any injuries, reports the AP. Two warning calls were made 45 minutes before the explosion, which comes a day before German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who imposed tough conditions on the Greek bailout, is due to visit the country. After six years of recession, public anger at austerity measures in Greece runs deep, with unemployment at 28% and incomes down around a third over the last four years, Reuters notes. Authorities, who believe a leftist or anarchist group is behind the bombing, say the bond issue issue is a sign that Greece is finally emerging from its debt crisis. "It is clear that the attackers are trying to set the agenda," a government spokesman says. "We will not allow the terrorists to succeed."

Still, no ground assault took place, though reservists stand at the ready and armored vehicles are massed at the border. The Israeli airstrikes hit the office of the Hamas prime minister, who wasn't there at the time, and a spokesman for Benjamin Netanyahu explained the rationale for moving beyond pure military targets to government buildings. “It is clear that Hamas itself makes no distinction between its terrorist military machine and the government structure and that they are intertwined," he said, reports the New York Times. In four days of fighting, Al Jazeera says 39 Palestinians and three Israelis have been killed. President Obama spoke with Netanyahu last night and "reiterated US support for Israel's right to self-defense and discussed possible ways to scale back the conflict," according to AP. Obama also called Egyptian leader Mohammed Morsi, and the White House said the president praised Morsi's efforts to ease tensions, without offering specifics.

Instead, her fashion business partner is introducing her to artists. But for now, she's enjoying the single life with "absolutely no plans on dating anytime soon," a source says. But, another source adds, "She’s been saying now that if she does date anyone, it could be someone who works in the arts world. Katie’s more interested in the quiet life now and an unassuming artist would fit the bill perfectly for when she’s ready." Then again, British magazine Grazia claims ex-fiance Chris Klein himself has actually been sneaking in to Katie's buildings for visits, Australia's News Network reports. "Chris was a real ladies' man when they were first together … he also had a major problem with alcohol," a source says. "He’s really cleaned himself up since then ... Katie likes the new Chris a whole lot more." Of course, all of this comes soon after fellow ex Jackson revealed Holmes called him up after her divorce…

In a tweet, Trump thanked Kim for the "nice letter" and for keeping his promise of returning what's believed to be the remains of US soldiers who fought in the Korean War, which arrived in Hawaii on Wednesday, per the AP. "I look forward to seeing you soon!" he added. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders didn't comment on when the two leaders might meet again, but she said Kim's letter spoke of "advancing the commitments made" at their June summit, spoofed in a K-pop artist's latest music video, per CNN.

Singer Jim Peterik tells Billboard that he was "surprised and dismayed at the misuse" of the Rocky III anthem, which was played as Mike Huckabee joined Davis for a rally after her release yesterday. "The song has motivated thousands through the years to reach beyond their limits," Peterik said in a statement. "Its use for the release of Kim Davis does not support my views or my politics. I have contacted my publishers to make sure this usage is stopped immediately." Guitarist Frankie Sullivan agreed, saying in a Facebook post that he hadn't given Davis permission to use the song—and he "would not grant her the rights to use Charmin!" Sullivan told Huckabee that he's not "The Donald" but he "can do better than that," reports the Washington Post, which takes a look at the creation and history of the song. Davis, meanwhile, plans to return to work this week, but a federal judge's order says she'll go straight back to jail if she tries to block the granting of marriage licenses for same-sex couples, reports CNN, which notes that Huckabee has volunteered to go to jail in her place. (When Newt Gingrich used "Eye of the Tiger" in 2012, Survivor members not only sued him, they violated his copyright.)

"I want to apologise deeply and unreservedly for my past behaviour and for the hurt and offence that I have caused," Brendan Cox said in a statement, per the Guardian. He said that "allegations from several years ago have resurfaced that makes concentrating on" his duties "much more difficult." Cox said late Saturday he would leave his positions at the Jo Cox Foundation and the More in Common charity. Both were started after his wife Jo Cox was shot and stabbed to death during the Brexit referendum in 2016, reports the AP. The Mail on Sunday published reports alleging sexual misconduct on his part. A woman in Cambridge, Mass., alleged in 2015 that Cox bought her drinks, grabbed her hips, and forcibly shoved his thumb in her mouth in a sexual way, per the Guardian. Cox called the newspaper's allegations a "massive exaggeration." Cox has advocated for his wife's beliefs. She was killed by a far-right activist.

The Book of Magical Charms, a handwritten manuscript penned by two unknown Brits in the 1600s, is shelved at Chicago's Newberry Library, along with two similar books, Quartz reports. The charms manual includes everyday tips and remedies, including how to alleviate menstrual cramps, soothe a toothache (use a dead man's tooth, obviously), and craft a super-strong key. It also enters "um … OK" territory, including details on how to chat with spirits and the ominous-sounding "activate the Seal of Solomon." Of the 522 pages contained in the three books, about 350 have been at least partially transcribed, a library rep told Chicagoist last week—and the library wants the public to get in on the act and help transcribe and translate the remainder. Those eager to further elucidate the texts can access The Book of Magical Charms online, as well as the other two tomes. "You don't need a PhD to transcribe," project coordinator Christopher Fletcher tells Smithsonian.com, with Atlas Obscura noting the process is "much like updating a Wikipedia page." Fletcher notes the book's survival is remarkable, as both the Protestant and Catholic churches at the time did everything they could to destroy magic-heavy manuscripts like this. Not everyone thinks the library's call for armchair transcribers is a smart move: "NO / BAD IDEA / NO / HAVE THESE PEOPLE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE HORROR MOVIE," one commenter tweets.

Things began an hour behind schedule, Zuckerberg showed up late to the Q&A (CNBC's explanation: He was in the bathroom), the presentation featured a video that many potential investors had previously viewed online, and the audience was only given enough time to ask eight questions, reports the Washington Post. (Reuters reports it was actually just five.) One of them was about Facebook's purchase of Instagram, which Zuckerberg defended and said he would do again, noting that Instagram's user data passed a "tipping point" that signaled it would grow much larger. One other detail of note: Security was apparently pretty extreme. Would-be investors had to show several forms of ID and be cross-checked against a list of attendees.

But does this flick, with a star-studded cast including Jennifer Lawrence, Donald Sutherland, Julianne Moore, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, stand above the rest? Here's what critics are saying: Tom Long at the Detroit News says the movie's "frustration and indecision, inaction and waiting," makes it "a more difficult and, in some ways, interesting movie than its predecessors." Lawrence is "terrific as always," but Mockingjay Part 1 "can't compete with the first two films, although it sets up what should be its stunning ending well enough." "If Mockingjay Part 1 is quieter and less flashy than its predecessors, that doesn't make it less satisfying," writes Steven Rea at the Philadelphia Inquirer. Lawrence shines as the "Joan of Arc of post-apocalyptic Panem" amid stars like Moore and Hoffman, who "manage to enliven their realpolitik chats with conviction" in their roles as leaders of the revolution, he writes. "The Hunger Games has turned out to be the best of these so-called long-term franchises," Wesley Morris writes at Grantland. "This third movie is cooler" than others, "but equally tense. You feel as if something’s at stake in this world." Still, it has "absolutely no nonmonetary reason to be Part 1 of anything. It isn't storytelling. It's a filibuster." And you may "despise how abruptly it ends." Moira Macdonald at the Seattle Times agrees. "It's a table-setter of a movie in which not much happens." Splitting Suzanne Collins' book into two movies "may have made sense from a business point of view, but dramatically it's a problem. You leave this well-acted, impeccably designed movie as you entered it: still waiting."

After Southern Californians saw a bright white streak and blooming cloud light up the night sky Friday, hundreds called 911, scared, reports ABC News. The culprit was much more benign: SpaceX, though Elon Musk's tweet of video of the cause, a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, Calif., was cheekily labeled, "Nuclear alien UFO from North Korea." Hours later, he tweeted, "If you liked tonight’s launch, you will really like Falcon Heavy next month: 3 rocket cores & 3X thrust. 2 cores return to base doing synchronized aerobatics. 3rd lands on droneship." The AP reports the rocket was carrying the latest batch of satellites—10 of them—for Iridium Communications. It's part of a contract that will see SpaceX update the Iridium system via 75 new satellites by mid-2018. This same Falcon 9 rocket carried some into orbit in June, though it launched from a platform in the Pacific.

Police responded to a domestic violence call Wednesday morning in Bankers Hill, where they say they were shot at by a man with a high-powered rifle. The suspect holed up in an apartment building—which lies in the flight path of incoming flights, though not departing ones, per the AP—and exchanged fire with police. The AP reports the suspect walked out and surrendered peacefully after a five-hour standoff. No one was hurt in the incident, and flights resumed Wednesday afternoon.

Or at least that's how things roll in Australia, where a crazy case managed to reach the nation's highest court, reports Bloomberg. It started in 2007, when a 30-something woman got hit in the face by a falling light fixture during a moment of passion with her lover in a motel room. Because her employer had booked the room, she filed for benefits and set off the legal fight. Though a federal court ruled in her favor, Australia's High Court decreed today that the woman is out of luck, reports the Australian. “The relevant question is: Did the employer induce or encourage the employee to engage in that activity?" said the court decision. “The majority held that the answer to that question was 'no.'" The woman needed treatment at the hospital for injuries to her face, notes ABC of Australia, and she also claimed post-traumatic stress disorder.

The office ruled that the 55-year-old took her own life by hanging inside her apartment on Park Avenue. The confirmation comes after husband Andy Spade revealed that his wife had been battling depression and anxiety for years, though Andy Spade said that he'd spoken to her the night before her death and that she had "sounded happy." Andy Spade emerged in public Thursday wearing a cartoon mouse mask in an apparent attempt to avoid being photographed, notes the New York Post. Her father: Spade's dad, Frank Brosnahan, tells the Kansas City Star that he spoke to his daughter Monday evening, the night before her suicide, and that "she was happy planning a trip to California to look at colleges" for her 13-year-old daughter. He knew of his daughter's problems, adding, "She'd been taking some pills, which I advised her not to take." His wish: Brosnahan also said his daughter would be pleased if her death prompted a serious discussion of depression. "One thing we feel is that any talk that they do that helps somebody else, Katy would have liked that," he said. "If that helped anybody avoid anything—fine, she'd be delighted."

The Hill reports fans of the president elect are ordering drinks at Starbucks and giving their names as "Trump" so baristas have to write "Trump" on their cups and yell it out. The movement took off Friday, with more than 27,000 tweets featuring the hashtag #TrumpCup, CNN reports. "Haven't been to @Starbucks in eons, but I have an urge to get a #TrumpCup," one man tweets. Starbucks addressed the protest in a statement: "Over the years, writing customer names on cups and calling out their names has been a fun ritual in our stores. Rarely has it been abused or taken advantage of. We hope and trust that our customers will continue to honor that tradition." The flames of #TrumpCup were fanned this week when a customer at a Florida Starbucks claimed his drink was taking too long due to "anti-white discrimination." Trump supporters are also cranky about Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz endorsing Hillary Clinton, as well as Starbucks' use of a "holiday" cup instead of a "Christmas" cup. But some people are questioning the logic of protesting a business by buying its products—an unorthodox choice to be sure. "Wow, the irony of millions of Trump supporters going to Starbucks and buying coffee to punish Starbucks. Unbelievable," one Twitter user writes.

Ryan was a 20-year-old student riding the first car of a train in London on July 7, 2005, when her roommate got off at King's Cross station. She hopped out the door, gave him a hug, and turned back to find the car full. She found a spot on the second car, not knowing that a man with a bomb was now in the space she had just occupied. Seconds later, between King's Cross and Russell Square, there was "a huge bang," Ryan tells the BBC. "The train screeched to a halt and a woman fell on me. It was like time stood still." As silence fell, Ryan began to hear "the hideous things next door," the quieting whimpers, "but I couldn't get in to help." Twenty-six people died in the first car, along with 26 others in four coordinated bomb attacks across London in what are now known as the 7/7 attacks—the worst terrorist act in Britain since 1988. On today's 10th anniversary, citizens stood in silence at 11:30am local time, remembering the three bombings on London's Tube and one on a bus in Tavistock Square. Commuters are sharing tributes on Twitter using the hashtag #WalkTogether, reports the Guardian. Prime Minister David Cameron, London mayor Boris Johnson, and Prince Andrew were among those to gather for a memorial service at St. Paul's Cathedral, along with survivors and relatives of victims. Elsewhere, people gathered at the key bombing sites. In addition to the 52 dead, 700 were injured and some 4,000 were affected by the blasts, per the Telegraph. Hundreds, if not thousands, suffered mental health problems as a result, including Ryan, who was diagnosed with PTSD two years ago. She witnessed terror, but "on that day on the train, I didn't see one selfish person," she says. "It was at once the awful side of humanity, but also the magical side."

Sam Hemming, a law school graduate of North Wales' Bangor University, was being driven home to Hereford by her boyfriend, Tom Curtis, in July when they got into an accident, per the Mirror: The car flipped, and while Curtis wasn't badly hurt, Hemming was left with broken neck bones, a fractured arm, and severe head injuries, leading doctors to place her in a medically induced coma, the Sun notes. After 19 days, the doctors said hope was gone, and Hemming's family gathered to say their goodbyes. Doctors said they'd switch her life support off and on three times before turning it off for good, just to make sure there was no brain activity—and as they prepared to switch it off for the final time, a medic brushed against her big toe with an icy-cold wipe and her toe wiggled. Doctors gave her a tracheotomy, and a few days later when they turned the life support off again, she could breathe on her own. The second part of Hemming's story: Doctors didn't think she'd ever walk or talk again, though now she's doing both as she recuperates at her parents' home. Even though Hemming suffers from PTSD and has memory loss, doctors are hopeful they can keep boosting her brain function, per the Hereford Times. "When I look at the pictures of me in the coma, it seems unreal," Hemming says. "And when I hear that my toe saved me, it's amazing." (A college student in a coma gave his mom a Christmas "miracle.")

The strategy mostly worked, but some high-tech archeology is finally revealing the camp's secrets, reports LiveScience. British archeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls led a team that conducted the first digs at the site in Poland—Treblinka was actually two separate camps—discovering three previously unidentified mass graves and the apparent location of one of the camp's two gas chambers. They found the latter by scanning the ground with lasers to reveal a brick wall and foundation, and Colls says the gas chambers were the camp's only brick buildings. Nearby, the team found tiles stamped with the Star of David, which meshes with eyewitness accounts that the gas chambers were set up to look like bathhouses. "Treblinka had never been looked at since the period after the war," says Colls. "And everybody had assumed that because the history books said it was destroyed, it was." Her team re-interred any remains they found after consulting with Poland's chief rabbi, "and it was heartwarming to see the reverence with which they treated" them, writes Curt Schleier at the Jewish Daily Forward. He got an early look at a show about the findings that airs at 8 Eastern tonight on the Smithsonian Channel. Treblinka: Hitler's Killing Machine is important and "worth watching," he writes, especially as the number of Holocaust survivors dwindles. David Hinckley at the Daily News agrees, though he was a little put off by the reality-show feel of its presentation. (Click to read about the recent arrest of a 93-year-old who worked at Auschwitz.)

The White House released years of performance reviews, including one in which Obama said Jackson "continues to inspire confidence with the care he provides to me, my family, and my team," the Washington Post reports. A White House statement released after Trump met privately with Jackson following his remarks Tuesday said the doctor wouldn't be "railroaded" by false accusations, reports the New York Times. But allegations of misconduct, including creating a hostile workplace and drinking on the job, continued to surface Tuesday, with sources telling CNN that an intoxicated Jackson banged on the hotel room door of a female employee during an overseas trip in 2015 until the Secret Service intervened. Jackson's confirmation hearing, originally set for Wednesday, was postponed after members of both parties expressed concern about Jackson's record. Sen. Jon Tester, the senior Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, says credible reports have been received about Jackson being drunk during overseas trips. "He is the primary attendant of the president, the most powerful man in the world," Tester tells the Times. "You don't know when he is going to need you."

Alex's bionic prosthetic limb was made by Limbitless Solutions, a nonprofit run by University of Central Florida students. The group's goal is to 3D-print affordable bionic limbs for kids (its appropriate URL: 3dhope.com), and this one is their first effort, the Washington Post reports. Using something called surface electromyography, electrical signals from the brain are communicated to the bionic arm, causing the hand to open and close. The awesome part: While a prosthetic typically clocks in around $40,000, the Iron Man arm cost less than $350 in materials; the fairly substantial research and development time were donated. The arm itself was actually donated to Alex, who was born without most of his right arm, with team members contributing their "coffee money" to cover the materials cost. "Albert has made it so affordable," says "Tony Stark" in the now-viral video, referring to Limbitless founder Albert Manero. "I'm probably going to start farming out a lot of my tech work to Albert, too. I feel like he could cut the price point down on one of my suits, which right now is, I guess about, I don't know, a billion and a half dollars."

Police in Palm Beach Gardens say footage captured by a security camera reveals the tennis star's Toyota SUV stops at a light at 1pm on June 9, and then proceeds on green before colliding with another car. Passenger Jerome Barson, 78, died June 22 from his injuries, and his wife, Linda, who was driving, suffered multiple injuries. The family sued Williams for negligence for causing the accident. Police initially faulted Williams, but changed that version in a statement on Friday, saying no blame had yet been determined, per the AP. The video shows that William has to stop in the intersection when a dark sedan makes a left turn in front of her. Williams then continues north just as Linda Barson's light turned green. Barson's Hyundai sedan proceeds westbound and hits Williams' passenger side. Williams, 37, was not injured. Police say Williams continued through the intersection "in accordance" with the law. But the Barsons' lawyer says in a statement the video shows Williams was in the intersection on a red light. "The witnesses clearly confirm the Barsons had a green light and lawfully entered the intersection." Williams' lawyer disputed that, saying she "had the right to proceed through the intersection and other vehicles including those with a red light changing to green, were obligated to yield the right-of-way." Williams, who is playing at Wimbledon, beat Japan's Naomi Osaka on Friday to advance to the fourth round.

One of the antiquated models on display at the University of Reading's Museum of English Rural Life ended up trapping a rodent and killing it, despite it having no bait and being somewhere around 155 years old, the BBC reports. Per a University of Reading blog post, museum staff got an email last week that read: "There appears to be a dead mouse in this mousetrap … which is not described as being there on the database." It turns out the rodent managed to get past university staff and into the trap, a feat that activated the device's seesaw mechanism and trapped the critter inside. (You can see more on the design here.) "As we don't expect these traps to be working as mousetraps, we don’t tend to check them regularly, hence the fact that the mouse sadly perished," the museum notes. The staff has decided to preserve the mouse—it was "giving off quite a stink … and so was fumigated by our Conservator"—and will be put out for display in the museum's new galleries now under construction. And to combat any cynicism bred by Jimmy Kimmel pranks and other PR stunts, the museum had this to say: "We can categorically deny that we planted the mouse in the trap in order to gain this publicity. Not only does it go against every rule in Conservation and museum ethics, we don't think any of our staff are Machiavellian enough to have pulled it off." Meanwhile, one of the museum's archivists gives a shoutout to the well-constructed implements of yesteryear, noting to the CBC: "Let's pay tribute to the Victorians, and how wonderfully they managed to make things." (Perhaps this man and wife who live like Victorians are onto something after all.)

Heidi Hemmat was an award-winning investigative journalist with a focus on business fraud for KDVR. In February 2015, her investigation led to fraud charges against a local business owner. According to Raw Story, Muhammed Murib of AAAA TV Electronics Repair and Vacuum started harassing and threatening Hemmat. Then it got worse. In a blog post revealing what happened, Hemmat says she got a call from Murib's therapist—under an exception to HIPAA laws that allows health providers to violate patient privacy when the patient "presents a serious and imminent threat of harm." The therapist said Murib was "homicidal" and planned to kill her. Hemmat says her boss at KDVR balked at the cost of providing security for her, saying, "If he was going to kill you, he would have done it by now." In a statement, KDVR denies the "unequivocally false" accusations, saying "we took Heidi's concerns very seriously and provided her with support, security, and an attorney, for which Heidi expressed her appreciation. To be clear, we never denied a request for additional security." Hemmat took out restraining orders against Murib, "but my sense of safety was gone—and the way I viewed my job forever changed," she writes. "I couldn't keep ambushing people who did bad things to other people." And so she quit. Despite the end of her journalism career and fear for her own life, Hemmat says she has found a reason to be thankful in her husband and young children.

But those with ADHD often also experience "hyperfocus," and there is now a growing call for more research into this piece of the disorder, which can be seen in both the inattentive and the hyperactive types. As psychologist Brandon Ashinoff has said, the disorder presents an "interesting paradox" in that people can have an overload of focus instead of a splintered attention span, reports New York magazine. "The field is wide open and people really need to start researching [hyperfocus]," one researcher says. "It’s not about having an attention deficit, it’s more a maldistribution of attention.... Hyperfocus can be very powerful." Some suggest that people with hyperfocus actually have an advantage over non-ADHD folks in that they are able to sustain extreme attention on a task for longer periods than normal. This can be detrimental, of course—focusing on a work project at the expense of one's laundry, or sleep, or attention to family—but notable adults with ADHD such as goalkeeper Tim Howard and musician Adam Levine say they excel at their jobs thanks to the energy bursts they get from ADHD. And while the academic data needs to catch up to the anecdotes, one new study published in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports Exercise suggests that short bouts of exercise can improve motivation and energy in adult males with symptoms of ADHD. The University of Georgia researchers point out that while prescription drugs can also help, exercise comes without the risk of abuse or negative side effects. (ADHD and workaholism appear to be linked.)

Assistant communication studies professor Andrea Quenette has been on paid leave since November, when a group of eight graduate students filed a discrimination complaint after she used the slur in response to a question in class. The university's Office of Institutional Opportunity and Access notified her on Friday that she did not violate the school's nondiscrimination or racial and ethnic harassment policies when she used the word, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. "This word is offensive, but it was used in the context of retelling a factual event that occurred at another campus," Quenette says, summarizing what the university wrote in a letter explaining its conclusion. The discussion occurred on Nov. 12, a day after a heated, campuswide town hall forum on race. Her comment was in response to a student's question about how to best talk about the event and racial issues with other students. After saying that as a white woman she found it difficult to relate to others' challenges, she noted that unlike on other campuses where there had been visible racist acts and assaults, she had not seen the N-word—she used the actual slur—spray-painted on walls at KU. Now the university has recommended that Quenette undergo cultural competency training, re-evaluate orientation curriculum to include more diversity support, and pair up with a faculty member. A black graduate student who complained about the incident said that while Quenette apparently didn't violate school policy, that doesn't mean her comments weren't perceived as racist by those who received them.

The biggest: FBI Chief James Comey told Congress that he sees no evidence to support Trump's claims that President Obama wiretapped him. Plus, Comey confirmed that the FBI is investigating possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign during the election. Also making news: Low numbers: The daily tracking poll at Gallup has Trump's job-approval rating at 37%, his lowest mark so far, and his disapproval rating rose to 58%. It's being chalked up to controversy over his wiretapping comments and opposition to the GOP health care plan, reports CNN. Net worth: Forbes says Trump's net worth has fallen $200 million since he took office to $3.5 billion. That drops him 220 spots to 544 in its ranking of the world's richest people. Trump's decline, however, isn't about politics but about the New York real estate market. Stephen Hawking: The famed physicist said in an interview that he's not sure he'd be welcome in America under Trump because of his opposing views on the environment. See story. Billboard: An anti-Trump billboard in Phoenix is making headlines thanks in part to its dollar-shaped swastikas, per Fox News. Loyalty: The Washington Post has an unflattering front-page story about the White House that says it has installed senior aides in Cabinet departments whose main job is to monitor the loyalty of Trump's secretaries. ProPublica also reported elements of the story here. Presidents Obama, George W. Bush, and Clinton did not use such a system. Happier news: Not all the news was negative, however. The president is going to be a grandfather again—son Eric and his wife, Lara, are expecting their first child. Trump already is a grandfather of eight, per US Weekly.

Rick and Morty, a popular animated series co-created by Dan Harmon for the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim roster, hasn't put up a new episode since October 2015, when it aired its second-season finale, the Atlantic notes. So fans were giddy with excitement Saturday when the network unexpectedly aired the first show of Season Three—and the episode's final moments had an additional surprise. Per Business Insider, Rick, who plays the mad-scientist title character, revealed his innermost motivations, and they involved a plum sauce the fast-food chain hasn't offered in nearly 20 years. "I want that 'Mulan' McNugget Sauce. ... That's my series arc, Morty," he tells his grandson. "If it takes nine seasons, I want that McNugget Szechuan sauce." What the deranged patriarch referred to is a condiment McDonald's offered as part of a co-branding effort with Disney in 1998 to push its movie Mulan. The special sauce is now making an appearance on eBay—though the listings mostly appear to be Rick and Morty-inspired jokes—and the show's writers even put out a plea on Twitter, asking McDonald's: "You wanna get in on this? Call me." The restaurant account's reply: "McNugga Lubba Dub Dub" (a twist on one of Rick's catchphrase); a top Mickey D's chef also said, "I'll see what I can do." Business Insider notes a live-action version of Mulan is due out in late 2018, so ... the McNugget's in your court now, McDonald's. (The chain is trying its hand at "cleaner" nuggets.)

That's how Zeke Smith sums up his adventure on Survivor: Game Changers, which turned out to be a bit more eventful than Smith's first appearance on the reality show last season. As Wednesday's episode revealed, fellow contestant Jeff Varner accused Smith of "a deception" before outing Smith as transgender, per the AP—a move that has drawn condemnation from an LGBT rights group, host Jeff Probst, and the public at large, per People. Though Varner apologized before he was voted off the show, Smith says he's struggled with forgiving him in the eight months since filming wrapped, in a piece for the Hollywood Reporter. "In calling me deceptive, Varner invoked one of the most odious stereotypes of transgender people," Smith writes. Varner, who is gay, implied "that I'm not really a man and that simply living as my authentic self is a nefarious trick." GLAAD has criticized Varner's move, while Probst tells Entertainment Weekly that the reaction of his teammates, who swiftly defended Smith, "mirrors what the vast majority of society will feel. You just don’t do that to someone." After Wednesday's episode aired, Varner offered his "deepest, most heartfelt apologies" in a statement on Twitter, per CNN. "I recklessly revealed something I mistakenly believed everyone already knew. I was wrong and make no excuses for it," he said.

Until now, maybe. Scientists might have detected one in orbit around a planet in the constellation Sagittarius, reports Nature. If so, it's the first so-called exomoon to be spotted around an exoplanet. The catch: They made the discovery during a unique "microlensing event," and it's all but impossible to repeat the observation. (Discovery has more details on the phenomenon, in which a celestial object drifts into perfect alignment between the Earth and another more distant star, and "the space-time bending gravitational field of the closest object" brightens the light of the more distant one.) After logging the microlensing event in June 2011 and analyzing it, astronomers believe the "closest object" could be a small star orbited by a Neptune-size planet, or a good-sized planet with its own moon. "It’s kind of a shame because we’ll probably never know what the answer is," says one astronomer not involved with the research. Still, "the exomoon evidence is tantalizing," writes Ian O'Neill at Discovery.

A sampling: "At her peak, Houston was the golden girl of the music industry," praised Billboard. "She wowed audiences with effortless, powerful, and peerless vocals that were rooted in the black church but made palatable to the masses with a pop sheen." "A light has been dimmed in our music community today," said the president of the Recording Academy, calling Houston "one of the world's greatest pop singers of all time." "First of all, I want to tell you that I love you all," said her ex-husband Bobby Brown, while performing a show in Mississippi hours after Houston's death, according to the AP. "Second, I would like to say, I love you, Whitney. The hardest thing for me to do is to come on this stage." "She was the most beautiful woman I think I ever saw," said Elton John at a Las Vegas concert. "Thank you for giving us your talent, and one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard." "She will never be forgotten as one of the greatest voices to ever grace the earth," tweeted Mariah Carey.

A new study suggests that the shape of their eggs played a role, reports the BBC. Scientists aren't sure exactly what that role was, but they do know that eggs of survivor birds were shaped differently than eggs of dinosaurs and birds that got wiped out. Among other things, the non-survivor eggs were more elongated and "significantly more symmetrical," says the news service. The difference in shape suggests that the birds themselves differed in physiology, reports phys.org, presumably in ways that gave them an advantage when the mass extinction took place 65 million years ago. One theory is that the differences in shape may have something to do with crucial differences in hatching and nesting behavior. "I suspect modern birds survived the major extinction event because they used contact incubation that's prevalent now," says one researcher from the UK's University of Lincoln. "They built nests and sat on their eggs whereas most of the birds prior to that were burying the eggs like their theropod ancestors, potentially making them more vulnerable."

"She wasn't scared of anything," her mother Loxie says at Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana, per NPR. "And for how small she is, she was..." At that point Loxie fights back tears for her daughter, who was 20 when she disappeared from the reservation last June, per ABC News. It's an old story in Indian Country, where up to 300 indigenous women are killed or disappear every year in the US and Canada, but the actual number is unknown because the FBI doesn't really keep track. That's where Annita Lucchesi comes in: A doctoral student at the University of Lethbridge in Canada, she is creating a database to track missing and murdered native women. Her method is to pepper local law enforcement agencies with public record requests, which has extended her list to 2,000 cases throughout Canada and the US. With the US Congress seemingly stalled in its case-tracking effort, and the Globe & Mail reporting that Canada's inquiry is awash in staff departures, Lucchesi hopes her effort will make people more aware. "Very high rates of criminalization, mental health issues and lack of resources, very high rates of trauma," she tells Montana Public Radio of the indigenous crisis. "All of those things create a perfect storm where rates of violence are very high, not just because people are more likely to be more violent but because Native women are valued less. And there are less ramifications for it."

On Wednesday, a University of Pennsylvania professor spotted an SUV near the Philadelphia Convention Center, souped up with two high-tech license-plate readers and a placard linking it to the Pennsylvania State Police—but with a Google Maps decal smacked onto its window, PhillyVoice.com reports. "WTF?" Matt Blaze tweeted with a picture of the strangely camouflaged vehicle, which the Philadelphia Police Department did confirm Thursday was part of its fleet. "However, the placing of any particular decal on the vehicle was not approved through any chain of command," a department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Motherboard. The rep adds the decals were ordered to be taken down ASAP and that an investigation was launched. What some are saying is worrisome is the fact that these Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs)—which law enforcement can use for everything from tracking down stolen cars to following up on AMBER Alerts—are able to take in thousands of plate images per minute, basically enabling law enforcement to spy on drivers without warrants. "It's certainly concerning if the city of Philadelphia is running mass surveillance and going out of its way to mislead people," Dave Maass, a researcher with the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, tells Motherboard. Gizmodo marvels at the apparently backfired scheme to cover up the SUV's real mission, noting that the Google Maps sticker "simply looked too handmade." Meanwhile, a Google rep tells Motherboard it is also looking into the matter. "If I were Google, I would be seriously rankled over the use of their logo to hide surveillance," Maass says.

Pyongyang has taken its complaint about The Interview all the way to the United Nations, reports Reuters. In the movie, Rogen and Franco play a TV producer and host who land an interview with Kim Jong Un and get hired by the CIA to kill him. In a letter to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, the North declares that the premise "should be regarded as the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as an act of war." (The North used similar language in an earlier diatribe.) Rogen is taking this about as seriously as you might expect: "People don't usually wanna kill me for one of my movies until after they've paid 12 bucks for it," he tweeted a while back. The movie is out in October, notes the Telegraph.

So it kind of made sense when an elementary school near Philadelphia sent out invitations for an Oscar-themed dance innocently adorned with photos of the celeb. Except: The school is Catholic and its principal remembered belatedly that DeGeneres is gay and thus a "poor role model" for students, reports Philly.com. Nancy Matteo of St. Andrew's school in Newtown issued an email of apology to parents asking for "every single invitation" to be returned so she can "personally destroy them." "A role model, as defined by Webster's Dictionary, is a person who is unusually effective or inspiring in some social role, job, position, etc.," she wrote. "This does not describe her at all. We work so hard to be good role models and then I go and do something stupid!" The LA Times, lamenting in its headline that "you can't be happy in Iran, you can't be gay Pennsylvania," suspects that Matteo is going to regret this move far more than the original invitation.

But a senior Amazon executive on the advisory panel now tells the Wall Street Journal that the new recommendations go even further, clearing the way for "gate to gate use" of devices, regardless of the apps they're running or the wireless transmission mode they're in. Paul Misener, Amazon's VP of global public policy, also says the panel recommended a simple system for airlines to prove that devices and WiFi won't interfere with their planes—one that looks at past tests instead of requiring a host of new ones. If the recommendations are approved, fliers would still have to use on-board WiFi to access the Internet—not due to safety concerns, but because the FCC bans airborne cell service. About 60% of commercial passenger planes are set up for WiFi, though the largest US inflight Internet provider says its service doesn't really work below 10,000 feet—so even though you may soon be allowed to read your Kindle during takeoff, you may not be able to download e-books at the time.

While the party has long celebrated Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson at such dinners, the pair's own slave-owning history is finally taking a toll. Jackson's role in driving Native Americans out of the southeastern US—the "Trail of Tears"—also is a factor. Democrats in Georgia, Connecticut, Missouri, Maine, New Hampshire, and other states have scrapped their Jefferson-Jackson affairs or are considering doing so. In Iowa, a Democratic leader said it's all about making sure the party lives up to the values of "inclusiveness, diversity, and equality." The New York Times also has taken notice: Controversy over the Confederate flag may be generating bigger headlines, its story observes, but the efforts by Democrats "to remove Jefferson and Jackson from their official identity underscore one of the most consequential trends of American politics: Democrats’ shift from a union-powered party organized primarily around economic solidarity to one shaped by racial and sexual identity."

"No clear answer," says the Washington Post. In other words, the stuff that lawyers dream of—a byzantine tangle of legal complications surrounding Hong Kong's ability to do so, and one that will be followed by an even greater legal mess when the Justice Department eventually asks that he be extradited. The latter could take "years" to resolve if Snowden chooses to fight it, reports the Guardian. Of course, there's also the possibility that Hong Kong police don't know where he is, but to fix that, they'd just need to pick up the New York Times: It says that for a week now, he's been "staying in an apartment in Hong Kong’s Western neighborhood that is controlled by the Hong Kong government’s security branch." Snowden himself apparently asked to go there for his own protection "against a possible rendition attempt by the United States." Meanwhile, an Icelandic businessman says he's keeping a plane at the ready in China to zip Snowden away to Iceland at a moment's notice, notes Reuters.

"I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents," Trump tweeted Friday morning. "I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn date, time, and place!" The tweet follows an interview with Fox News in which Trump made a similar point, reports CNN. "Why didn't somebody call the FBI 36 years ago?" Trump asked in the Fox interview. "I mean you could also say when did this all happen, what's going on? To take a man like this and besmirch—now with that being said, let her have her say and let's see how it all works out." In another tweet Friday, Trump described Kavanaugh as a "fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don’t want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay." As things stand now, Kavanaugh is expected to testify Monday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Ford is negotiating to appear later in the week, perhaps Thursday. (Did Kavanaugh favor "a look" for his clerks?)

The fuss started when a Russian official, in rebutting claims of those lousy hotel rooms, accused foreigners of sabotage with this quote to the Wall Street Journal: "We have surveillance video from the hotels that shows people turn on the shower, direct the nozzle at the wall, and then leave the room for the whole day." That set off a furious Internet reaction, most of it along the lines of the Huffington Post's "He's Watching You Shower!" headline, accompanied by a photo of Vladimir Putin. Amid the outcry, a spokesman for the original Russian official walked back the statement. "No such thing was ever said," he asserted, suggesting that it was either a mistranslation or a joke, reports AP. He insisted that no guests' hotel room have surveillance cameras. Of course, NBC reporter Richard Engel said this week that his equipment got hacked as soon as he arrived in Russia, notes HuffPo. “The State Department warns that travelers should have no expectation of privacy," he said. "Even in their hotel rooms."

On that day, the 20-year-old stood in front of a Clark County, Nev., judge and explained why her birth certificate should read male. And then it was so, and Maddy forever became Jake, and Jake called his dad to share the good news. Jon Ralston heard a "giddy" voice on the other end of the line, and the moment inspired Ralston—"one of the most respected political reporters in Nevada," per the Washington Post—to write a "love story," a blog post about "how my daughter became my son," he tweeted. It's been shared more than 16,000 times. The post is bookended with parallel statements, opening with the line, "When Maddy Ralston came into this world almost 21 years ago, it was love at first sight." He writes of "a stunning, blonde-blue-eyed kid" who he thought of as a tomboy through and through. "We went shopping for clothes, and she would never go into the girls’ section. Always the boys. It wasn't even a question. I didn’t really care. She was my little girl, and I adored her." He could tell that things were rough for Maddy as she was teased and bullied and called a lesbian in high school, that "something wasn't right." But "I don't think I even listened very well when Maddy told me a few years ago she was really a male inside." What he thought was a phase clearly wasn't, and Ralston has "come to not just accept it but to embrace" his child's truth—though there are moments when it's hard. And then, that touching bookend: "When I get home later this week, I will see someone officially named Jake Ralston for the first time. And one thing I know for certain: It will be love at first sight." Read his full post here.

Macken, 88, says he has written to immigration minister Peter Dutton and offered a "body swap" with somebody in a camp in Nauru or on Indonesia's Manus Island, the Guardian reports. "I understand this is an unusual request but I offer it in complete sincerity," Macken wrote. "My reason for making this proposal is simple. I can no longer remain silent as innocent men, women, and children are being held in appalling circumstances on Manus Island and Nauru." "It is even worse that they are being held in these dangerous and inhospitable conditions in order to ensure no other asylum seekers and refugees attempt to come to Australia for protection," he wrote. "The Australian government is essentially treating refugees in these camps as human shields and this is utterly immoral." Macken wrote that he would consider it a "privilege" to live out his final years in one of the camps in return for a refugee becoming an Australian citizen. He says he isn't making the offer for publicity and will happily make the swap without it being publicly announced, the BBC reports. (Australia has been accused of covering up "routine dysfunction and cruelty" at the Nauru camp, including hundreds of incidents involving children.)

Halper is the largest single donor to the Occupy Wall Street movement, having donated $20,000 to the anti-corporate Adbusters magazine, which launched the protests. The weirdest thing about Halper is not that he’s a retired Wall Street trader who used to vice chair the New York Mercantile Exchange, or that he’s a 1-percenter. No, the weirdest thing about Halper is that in addition his Adbusters donation, he also donated the maximum allowed $2500 to the presidential campaign of corporate favorite Mitt Romney. “We can only imagine what it's like to have enough money to write several-thousand-dollar checks to causes that effectively cancel each other out,” writes Max Read on Gawker. Halper explains his giving to the New York Times as “a little ADD—like me.” He is a longtime donor to Adbusters and friend of the editor in chief, and wrote the check despite “rolling his eyes” at the idea initially, he says. He soon found himself swept up in the excitement and now makes daily visits to Zuccotti Park, which he calls “the coolest place in New York.” “If there’s pain,” he concludes, “it should be shared.”

A look at coverage of the anniversary: Bias starred at the University of Maryland, and a feature in the Baltimore Sun includes a memory of his first game as a starter. He was a nervous kid for much of it, until teammate Pete Holbert committed a foul, and Bias then took control and led the Terps to an OT win. "It was like, 'This guy is going to be really good," recalls Holbert. That prediction proved true. The Washington Post quotes Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski as saying in 2003 that only two opposing players had stood out in his long career: Bias and a guy named Michael Jordan. "He could invent ways to score, and there was nothing you could do about it," the coach said of Bias. Another person put it this way: "He was It." After his death—"the cruelest thing I've ever heard," said Celtics great Larry Bird—Bias became a pawn in the war on drugs, writes Jon Schuppe at NBC News. His OD "sparked a panic, stoked by false rumors and a high-stakes political campaign, that culminated in a law that swept thousands of low-level drug offenders—most of them young and black—into prison." The effects of that law, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, still resonate today. Bias' mother, Lonise, lost a second son to a drive-by shooting a few years later, and has since worked as a community activist helping young people, reports WTOP. A post at Deadspin sums it up this way: "His death still makes everyone crazy."

Once again, Rand Paul is at the center of things, with Paul saying his stance against the surveillance is a fight for civil liberties and critics like John McCain accusing him of fundraising theatrics, reports the Washington Post. As things stand now, key parts of the Patriot Act are set to expire on June 1. The Senate has gone into recess, but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is bringing everybody back on May 31 for a rare Sunday session to try to figure out a last-minute fix. “This is a high-threat period,” said McConnell, who maintains that even a brief lapse in the act is a threat to national security. All this became necessary when the Senate last night blocked a House compromise measure called the USA Freedom Act that would curb the surveillance programs. (Under the bill, the NSA would no longer collect metadata but could still gain access to it from phone companies.) When that failed, McConnell tried to extend the expiring Patriot Act provisions by one week, then four days, then two days, and then one day. All the extensions were rejected, one by one, thanks to Paul and help from Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich. The upshot is that it's now "almost a sure bet that portions of the Patriot Act" will expire at least temporarily, reports the Hill, which notes that the House is in recess through the end of May.

Trump is a "total disaster" who needs to go, Jimmy Kimmel told viewers. Trump supporters should "treat the situation like you would if you'd put Star Wars wallpaper up in the kitchen: 'All right, I got caught up. I was excited, I made a mistake, and now it needs to go,'" he said, per the New York Times. Kimmel suggested Trump be promoted to a king with no power. "We need to set him up in a castle ... lead him to the top and then lock the door to that castle—forever." Other reactions: Stephen Colbert. The Late Show host played a clip of Trump saying "I think there's blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and neither do you," and quipped: "The only thing I'm doubting right now is if you’re still going to be president by Friday," Mediaite reports. Colbert also poked fun at Trump for saying the white nationalists in Charlottesville had a permit for their protest. "You've got to give it to the Nazis," he said. "They always do their paperwork." James Corden. The CBS host mocked Trump for saying he waited until he had all the facts before commenting on Charlottesville. "It's true, he only makes a statement when he has the facts," he said. "You know, like when he told us how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history. Or that time he told us Meryl Streep was a bad actress." Seth Meyers. Meyers introduced a new segment called "Breaking Crazy" to deal with what he described as a "clinically insane" performance. "Trump is like a bad waitress in a crappy diner who’s trying to get fired so she can go to a concert," he said. "Congress, isn't this enough? Cut bait on the president." Conan O'Brien. "In the press conference, President Trump said that Steve Bannon was a good friend and not a racist," O'Brien said, per the Washington Post. "Then he said, 'Oops, I meant to say, 'a good racist, and not a friend.'" The Daily Show. The most-quoted remark from the show was a tweet hours before airtime: "Today is the day Donald Trump became president of the Confederacy."

A report ranks 29 multinational tech companies on their responsiveness to inquiries about conditions at supplier factories; Apple comes in last, the Financial Times reports. The report cites Apple’s failure to respond to poisonings that hospitalized 49 workers at one site. “Apple behaved differently from the other big brands and seemed totally complacent and unresponsive,” the report’s main author told the FT. The criticism follows a spate of suicides at another Apple supplier, Foxconn, and Ariel Schwartz of Fast Company says the company better be careful. “If Apple continues to ignore supply chain issues, the problems will only grow—and eventually, they will come back to haunt the company.”

Paul Ryan's proposal wouldn't have changed anything for people already 55 and older, and it would only have altered—not ended—Medicare for others, says the non-partisan fact-checking website. It points to "nine separate fact-checks" invalidating the Democrats' claim. Simply replacing "end Medicare" with "privatize Medicare" would have been a big improvement, the site suggests. But PolitiFact acknowledges that a number of key voices—among them Talking Points Memo, the Daily Kos, and Paul Krugman—disagree. (The Huffington Post's headline was "Politi-Fail.") Indeed, the Washington Monthly calls PolitiFact's analysis "indefensible." "The House Republican budget plan intended to privatize the existing system and replace it with something very different—a voucher scheme," writes Steve Benen. "It would still be called 'Medicare,' but it wouldn’t be Medicare." (Click to read how Ryan has since altered his plan.)

After the video went viral on Monday, resource officer Ben Fields was shifted to administrative duties pending an investigation, the State reports, and the school district says Fields has been told "not to return to any school in the district." A Richland County Sheriff's Department spokesman says the girl, who was still seated when Fields flipped her desk over, was arrested for disturbing the peace. A fellow Spring Valley High School student tells NBC News that the officer was called in after the girl refused a request to leave the classroom. The girl shows no sign of resistance during the video, and in a longer version, Fields can be heard threatening to arrest a student who objected, reports Reuters. A sheriff's office spokesman tells the State that the sheriff has seen the video and "was very disturbed by what he saw." NBC reports that a 2013 lawsuit accused Fields, who is white, of "unfairly and recklessly" targeting "African-American students with allegations of gang membership and criminal gang activity." Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin issued a statement calling the officer's behavior unacceptable and asking for an independent investigation, the State reports.

It must be true because Mayor Bloomberg and police chief Ray Kelly keeping trumpeting the stat, and the media keep circulating it. (Like in this profile.) ProPublica took a look at the NYPD's own list of the 14 to test the accuracy of the claim. "Is it true? In a word, no," writes Justin Elliott. The boast "overstates both the number of serious, developed terrorist plots against New York and exaggerates the NYPD's role in stopping attacks." Of the 14, ProPublica says two, maybe three, qualify as true terror threats. And that includes "a failed attempt to bomb Times Square by a Pakistani-American in 2010 that the NYPD did not stop." What's more, the NYPD doesn't seem to have played a big role in most of the busts. "In several cases, it played no role at all." See the full article and a breakdown of the 14 cases here. (Asked about the story today, Bloomberg responded: “I could make as cogent an argument there’s double or triple the number that were stopped. We just don’t know about it." More on that here.)

Researchers concluded that after Los Angeles authorities shut down hundreds of dispensaries last year, crime actually increased around the closed facilities. The victory proved short-lived: Rand has pulled the controversial study for review after the LA city attorney and other officials demanded its retraction, reports the Los Angeles Times. “As we’ve begun to take a look at the report, we decided it’s best to remove it from circulation until that review is complete," said a spokesman. The city attorney had criticized the study—which compared crime stats in particular areas 10 days before the dispensaries shut down and 10 days after—as "highly suspect and unreliable."

Mario Zervigon, his family, and fellow tenants escaped their New Orleans apartment building on Thursday, leaving Zervigon stunned by an attack that investigators say is clearly arson. "I don't know if I was targeted," he tells the Times-Picayune. "I don't know what's what. It's just a shock." Zervigon works as a fundraiser for state utility regulatory board candidate Forest Bradley-Wright, who believes that people with solar panels should be allowed to sell off their extra electricity to utility companies. Bradley-Wright is in a runoff with incumbent Eric Skrmetta, who wants to limit the amount that solar users can sell. "I don't know if [the attack] is connected to anything I do," says Zervigon. What he's done lately: help Bradley-Wright raise about $210,000, including $100,000 over the past 10 days—which nearly equals the $215,000 that Skrmetta has raised. The ATF, which is investigating because the blaze destroyed a commercial building, says it will take "a few weeks" to turn up lab results on the fire. "Obviously, someone did this," says Zervigon's wife. "Why would you think anything like this would ever happen in New Orleans?"

Officers say they've uncovered a single bar worth up to $500,000 in South Florida, though they won't specify how or exactly where they came across it. They are saying, however, that the 26-pound bar was on the truck that was robbed by armed men in North Carolina while en route from Miami to Massachusetts on March 1. "This confirms that there is a South Florida nexus to this crime," an FBI investigator says, per ABC News. "We believe that additional gold bars from the robbery may still be in South Florida and we continue to need the public's help in solving this crime." The FBI has added a $25,000 reward for information on the case to the $50,000 reward already offered by TransValue, the company that was transporting the gold. Its guards said they were approached by at least two Spanish-speaking men after they had pulled over due to mechanical issues—a claim that is still under investigation, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports. The men identified themselves as "Policia" before tying up the guards and leading them into the woods, officers say. Police previously believed the suspects could be tied to Florida because a traffic cone placed behind the van in which the gold was loaded during the robbery featured the marking of a company that only does work in the state.

"Obvious to both Knight and Curry was that their marriage would require more effort then a garden-variety relationship.

"Plunges" and "plummets" are the common verbs Friday morning, with the price of the cryptocurrency falling more than $3,000 to below $13,000 on some exchanges before rebounding a bit, reports CNBC. That's down from a high of $19,000-plus in a week. In fact, the sharp drops triggered temporary halts in trading on two major futures exchanges, CBOE and CME, that recently began working with Bitcoin. “Has the bubble finally popped? It’s hard to see the bell tolling just yet," an analyst at ETC Capital tells the Guardian. "Large price swings have become so normal that it’s hard to decide." He sees a few factors at play in the year-end drop, including the hack of a major exchange in South Korea and some high-profile public infighting in the Bitcoin community. On the latter point, Bloomberg has details on some "Bitcoin whales" jumping ship.

"I fear that there's going to be an assassination … I really worry that somebody is going to be killed," the Republican senator from Kentucky told WHAS on Tuesday, referring to Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation and ongoing protests in Washington. "Those who are ratcheting up the conversation, they have to realize they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence," he added, referencing Sen. Cory Booker's call in June for activists concerned with ending homelessness to "get up in the face of some congresspeople," per the Hill. "What he doesn't realize is that for every 1,000 persons who want to get up in your face, one of them is going to be unstable enough to commit violence," Paul said, per Time. "When I was at the ballfield and Steve Scalise was nearly killed, the guy shooting up the ballfield … was yelling, 'This is for health care.'" His comments echoed a recent CNN op-ed by his wife, Kelley Paul, who also called out Booker. "Preventing someone from moving forward, thrusting your middle finger in their face, screaming vitriol—is this the way to express concern or enact change?" she wrote. Describing "violence and threats of violence at a horrifying level," she added, "I now keep a loaded gun by my bed."

Some 10,000 people out of a population of 330,000 have as of Monday joined a campaign to urge the government to accept more Syrian refugees—and even offered space in their homes, the Telegraph and AFP report. "I think people have had enough of seeing news stories from the Mediterranean and refugee camps of dying people and they want something done now," says author Bryndis Bjorgvinsdottir, who launched the campaign Sunday after the Icelandic government said it was only able to help 50 refugees. What one resident had to say: "I'm a single mother with a 6-year-old son ... We can take a child in need. ... We have clothes, a bed, toys and everything a child needs. I would of course pay for the airplane ticket." More on the crisis: All trains from the main station in Budapest, Hungary were halted today, the day after thousands of people, including many Syrians fleeing the civil war, were allowed to board trains north to Austria and Germany without the proper documents, the AP reports. When trains from Budapest arrived in Vienna last night, overwhelmed authorities allowed the passengers to disembark and disperse. Thousands of Austrians outside the station carried signs welcoming them and some had brought food for the hungry travelers. "They have been traveling so long and must be very hungry and they have been treated so shabbily,” a social worker tells the New York Times. "We felt we had to do something," she says. "It's a small thing but maybe it will help." Hundreds more people arrived in Germany last night on trains from Budapest last night. The country is the preferred destination of many and chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the European Union's open-borders agreement could be in danger if other countries fail to take their fair share of refugees, Reuters reports. EU rules state that refugees should register in the first country they arrive in, but this protocol has been widely ignored and Germany says it has now been suspended for those fleeing the Syrian conflict, reports the BBC. (Police say they have found out how 71 people found dead in an abandoned truck in Austria died.)

Kirsten Gillibrand expressing anger at the harassment of women in the military. This time, she was grilling Marines chief Gen. Robert Neller in the wake of the revelation that photos and videos of female Marines, sometimes nude, had been widely shared in online groups. One exchange, via ABC News, sums it up: Gillibrand: "It is a serious problem when we have members of our military denigrating female Marines who will give their life to this country in the way they have, with no response from leadership. So if you're dedicated to fixing the culture of the Marines and all the services, what do you plan to do to hold commanders responsible who fail to get this done?" Neller: "I'm responsible. I'm the commandant. I own this, and we are going to have to, you know, you've heard it before, but we're going to have to change how we see ourselves and how we do—how we treat each other. That's a lame answer, but ma'am, that's the best I can tell you right now. We've got to change, and that's on me." The New York Times, meanwhile, has the story of one of the women victimized. Savannah Cunningham, a 19-year-old in Phoenix, made a nude video for a Marine she was dating in a long-distance relationship, and it surfaced in the online forums. Cunningham wasn't in the military at the time, but, despite the harassment she endured over the video, ships out for basic training next month. “Someone needs to stand up and say this does not represent the values of the Marine Corps,” she tells the newspaper. “If not me, then who?” A story in the Navy Times shows the challenge: It confirms that the scandal is not confined to the Marines, with women from at least a dozen Navy commands also specifically targeted in the online forums, likely by other sailors.

An online uproar ensued this week after a federal advisory panel recommended killing 45,000 such horses and burros, but Reuters reports that no such plans are in the works. It quotes a spokesman for the US Bureau of Land Management as saying in an email that the agency will "continue its current policy of caring for unadopted or unsold wild horses and burros" and will "not sell or send any animals to slaughter." Left unclear, however, is whether that decision could change when the agency formally responds to the advisory panel's recommendation months from now. The animals are currently being kept in off-range corrals after being removed from lands mostly in the West to prevent overgrazing. The first option is to try to have people adopt the animals, but the BLM says it can find nowhere near the number of necessary takers, and so spends about $50 million a year caring for the animals. The BLM estimates that in addition to the animals rounded up, another 67,000 are roaming wild, up from 58,000 just last year, reports the Christian Science Monitor. A lack of natural predators helps explain the jump.

Matt Ivy shared the footage from Saturday in a desperate attempt to get 10-week-old Chipper back; in it, two men can be seen pulling up to the gated yard in Mesquite, Texas, before one jumps out, grabs Chipper from over a fence, and carries him off as he yelps and two adult dogs in the yard bark at the men. Ivy, a Dallas firefighter who's also a dog breeder, also created a GoFundMe campaign to raise reward money for the Dogue de Bordeaux or French mastiff puppy, which is valued at $3,000. On Wednesday, Ivy and Chipper were reunited "thanks to the help of media and local citizens," per FOX 4. "Somebody sold Chipper to a good man that called me and returned him," Ivy explained on his Facebook page. "Sorry it's so short, police have asked me to keep details minimal." Police are still looking for the suspects, the Dallas News reports. Ivy says he started breeding French mastiffs after seeing the movie Turner and Hooch. "They told me that's just a mutt. You'll never find one," he tells FOX 4. "Flipped through a dog book 15 years ago and found them. Did my research and got them. Been in love with them ever since."

Bill Haslam has a bill coming his way that has the Bible nominated as the official state book, a move critics say would be both "unconstitutional and sacrilegious," per Nashville Public Radio. The state Senate approved the holy tome 19-8 Monday night, which could make Tennessee the first state to adopt the Bible as its official book, the Tennessean reports. Advocates of HB 0615 insist it doesn't violate either federal or state constitutional mandates on the separation of church and state, mainly because they're basing their nomination not on the Bible's religious import, but on its historical, cultural, and even financial significance (NPR notes the state's multimillion-dollar Bible-printing industry). "This book has done more to bring us to where we are today than any other book in the history of mankind," argued Republican Sen. Kerry Roberts, who said he was initially conflicted about whether to vote for the bill (he did). What held him, and some others, back: the idea of the Bible being trivialized next to other state symbols—including a Barrett M82 sniper rifle and a state song about two guys looking for moonshine, per the AP. "I hear Satan snickering," Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris noted last year, adding it would "dumb the good book down," per the Times Free Press. The director of ACLU-Tennessee tells the Tennessean that "privileging one religion over another not only tramples on the Constitution, it marginalizes the tens of thousands of Tennesseans who choose to practice other religions or not to practice religion at all." Haslam has signaled his own reservations. "The Bible is the most important book in my life, and I think in the world," he told reporters last week, the AP notes. "But that's very different than being the state's official book." He has 10 days to sign the bill or veto it once he receives it; if he does neither, it automatically becomes law. (The Ten Commandments were removed from the Oklahoma capitol.)

In interviews with reporters, Cuban officials say they have investigated thoroughly and cannot find the source of the mystery ailments. But they strongly reject the accusation, made by President Trump and other US officials, that Cuba is somehow responsible. "Our main concern at this moment are the accusations being made by the US government and we are focused on that because this is a slander," says Coronel Ramiro Ramirez. As for some kind of acoustic weapon: "It's impossible," Lieutenant Colonel Jose Alazo tells Reuters. "We are talking about science fiction." Cuban officials say they examined hotel rooms, conducted air and soil tests in the neighborhoods of diplomats' homes, talked to hundreds of neighbors, looked into whether insects might be to blame—and came away with nothing, reports NBC News. "Not even one person was sick," says a doctor. As for whether a third party such as Russia might be responsible, the officials say Cuba would never allow that on their territory, though Ramirez added, "We don't have definitive answers yet." One hindrance to the Cuban inquiry: The US has not provided access to victims' medical files or to homes where the illnesses occurred, and the officials called for greater cooperation on that front. The US has pulled most of its diplomats out of the country in the wake of the illnesses, though scientists outside of Cuba are similarly skeptical of a sonic attack.

The rapper was scheduled to appear at Columbia's Colonial Life Arena with a slew of other acts, including Cardi B and 2 Chainz, as part of the second annual Fall Ball, but he balked at following "standard safety procedures" at a checkpoint, the arena noted in a statement. Instead, he turned around and left, leaving the show to go on without him. "While we regret the artist's decision not to perform, Colonial Life Arena is not willing to bypass its security standards and jeopardize the safety of its patrons, performers, or staff members," the arena statement read. Refunds will start to be doled out Monday "at the point of purchase," the statement notes, per the State.

She was hospitalized in serious condition. (A NJ lawmaker is trying to make texting and walking illegal.)

"Magical things are happening all around her—ornate sets, clever video displays, fiery dancing—but Ms. Spears is there mostly to activate memories, to be a souvenir for the eyes. Rarely did the voice booming out over the speakers appear to be coming directly from Ms. Spears’s mouth. Always a notch or three less committed than her backup dancers, she was at times downright listless." But everything about the production other than Britney herself "is splashy and top volume," including the "vibrant" costumes, "powerful" choreography, and "imposing" set design. The show was certainly cheesy, writes Sophie Schillaci at MTV, and "if you're looking for a powerhouse vocal performance in your Vegas entertainment," you'd be better served by Celine Dion. "But Britney fans will find no better show on the strip than Piece of Me," a "larger-than-life production" that will get the audience on its feet, and is more a nostalgic "greatest hits marathon" than a look forward. On Celebuzz, Jason Marshall offers up the pros and cons of the show. Among the highlights: Britney can still dance (in sneakers); her hair and costumes (there are "at least seven costume changes," including three wigs and a pair of huge angel wings) are fantastic; the 24-song set list is "amazing" and will have you singing along; the set is "awesome"; and the merch is "pretty incredible." Among the lowlights: Only the expensive seats include a close-up view of Britney (the huge screens don't actually show what's happening onstage); most of the songs have been shortened; Spears barely addresses the audience or gets personal; and oh yeah, she doesn't "appear to be singing throughout a lot of the show," though the pre-recorded remixes are still "all sorts of awesome." Similarly, Rolling Stone rounds up the "5 best and 5 saddest" moments from the show. Caryn Ganz concludes, "Viewed through a lens of diminished expectations ... Britney: Piece of Me is an entertaining tour through the 32-year-old star's nearly 15-year recording career" and features "flashes of greatness" ... as well as a few "true bummers." Time offers up some of the best videos from the event. "Who cares if Britney doesn’t actually sing during her show?" writes Courtney Subramanian. "What she gives in pumped-up dance moves and dazzling costume changes is a huge leap forward from her disastrous going-through-the-motions 2007 VMA performance."

How its new Safety Check feature works: If you're in an affected area—this is determined using the city listed in your profile, a location last recorded by the Nearby Friends feature if applicable, and where you're using the Internet—the tool sends you a notification asking if you're safe, according to Facebook's blog. When the "I'm Safe" button is clicked, an update is automatically posted to your News Feed, along with any comments you provide, Engadget reports. You can also mark friends as safe, browse through all check-ins, or inform Facebook that you're not actually in the affected area. Mark Zuckerberg unveiled the feature in Japan, which was just hit by two typhoons in a week. "A truly useful tool, or just a cagey way to try to take some of the creepiness out of the apps' location tracking features?" asks Richard Lawler for Engadget. "We're figuring the latter impression doesn't hurt from Facebook's perspective." Safety Check was born out of a Japanese effort. Facebook engineers there created the Disaster Message Board after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc on the country. A test of that tool spawned an "overwhelming" response that inspired this latest feature, which will be available worldwide on Android, iOS, and desktops. But Safety Check may step on the toes of another Internet giant, PC World points out. Google has launched "Person Finder" sites to track survivors of numerous disasters, including flash floods in India and the 2010 earthquake in Chile.

When Herman Cain was asked about his earlier comments that he wouldn’t allow a Muslim in his administration, or that they should take an extra loyalty oath, Gingrich jumped in with an anecdote about the Times Square bomber, Think Progress notes. Asked why he’d violated his oath to the US, the bomber, in Newt’s telling, replied, “You’re my enemy. I lied.” “If you’re not prepared to be loyal to the United States, you will not serve in my administration, period,” Newt continued. “We did this in dealing with the Nazis and we did this in dealing with the communists.” Muslim groups were outraged, and political analysts were perplexed. “Either he is doing this for political purposes to distract people from a campaign in disarray, which is bad, or he actually believes it, which is scary,” ex-Bush strategist Matthew Dowd tells ABC.

During an interview on the Tavis Smiley show on PBS last week, Cumberbatch was asked about diversity in acting roles and said, "I think as far as colored actors go it gets really different in the UK, and a lot of my friends have had more opportunities here [in the US] than in the UK, and that's something that needs to change. Something's gone wrong. We're not representative enough in our culture of different races, and that really does need to step up apace." Of course, Cumberbatch was quickly called out for using the term "colored." Yesterday, he apologized, telling People he feels like a "complete fool." "I'm devastated to have caused offense by using this outmoded terminology," he said in a statement. "I offer my sincere apologies. I make no excuse for my being an idiot and know the damage is done. I can only hope this incident will highlight the need for correct usage of terminology that is accurate and inoffensive. The most shaming aspect of this for me is that I was talking about racial inequality in the performing arts in the UK and the need for rapid improvements in our industry when I used the term. ... While I am sorry to have offended people and to learn from my mistakes in such a public manner please be assured I have. I apologize again to anyone who I offended for this thoughtless use of inappropriate language about an issue which affects friends of mine and which I care about deeply." (Click to see Cumberbatch prove he can pronounce the word "penguins.")

Instead, he delivered “what was likely the most horrifically devastating keynote presentation in SXSW history,” Alissa Walker writes at Fast Company. Loads of audience members left halfway through, then furiously tweeted their displeasure. Many blamed buzzword-happy interviewer Umair Haque, who talked about his vacation, blog, and “generally himself.” But some of the blame has to fall on Williams. The CEO unveiled @Anywhere, a new feature that will allow sites to easily integrate Twitter content. “It’s a slick feature,” writes Nicholas Ciarelli of the Daily Beast, but “audience members were justified in being unimpressed. … One now gets the sense that Twitter is focusing too much on being awesome, instead of addressing the more difficult questions about the future of its business.

Their class-action lawsuit attacking the company for luring clueless children with "addictive," expensive game apps was recently given the go-ahead by a San Jose judge. Games are "highly addictive, designed deliberately to be so, and tend to compel children playing them to purchase large quantities of game currency, amounting to as much as $100 per purchase or more," according to court documents. The apps can often be downloaded for free, but kids can rack up big bills purchasing extra levels and items. "Smurfberries," for example, which serve as currency in the Smurfs game, sell in batches costing up to $59, notes MSNBC. Children are usually not required to provide credit card information, and the costs are automatically billed to parents' iTunes accounts. Apple was recently forced to change security settings on iPhones to block such charges. In one case, a 7-year-old British boy racked up a $2,000 bill on an iPad buying animals for the Tap Zoo game, reports the Daily Mail. Parents say that it's all part of a devious plan, while Apple has argued that it's easy for parents to block their children from making such charges.

"F**k you, Opioids," reads the headline of the post on the Brunswick Memorial Funeral Home's page. "What am I supposed to say when we get a call from someone telling me that a loved one has passed from an overdose? I’m sorry? Please accept my condolences?" writes Peter Kulbacki. "Yeah, that’s what I say, but you know what? My visceral response when I hang up the phone is F**K you opioids." Kulbacki, who describes himself as a "consummate professional" not normally prone to swearing, says there's a problem—particularly in his county. He recounts stories of police officers who have to return to the station for more Narcan mid-shift because they've already used the initial two doses they take on patrol with them, and families devastated by addiction turned fatal. "We have to stand and fight….as a community," the post concludes. "We have to beat this horrible monster." The post has gone viral, and Kulbacki tells ABC 7 he's received mostly positive feedback. He tells NJ 101.5 he felt he had to write about it after the "notable increase" in overdose deaths he's seen. He's been in the funeral business 40 years, and he tells Philly.com he hopes the conversation around his piece will lead to some solutions.

The ballistic missile went up about 3am Wednesday local time and flew east before coming down in the Sea of Japan. "We will take care of it," President Trump told reporters afterward, per CNBC, but he did not elaborate. Military analysts from the US and South Korea were still assessing the type and scope of the missile. More details and developments: An ICBM? One big question is whether it was a standard missile or one of the intercontinental variety capable of reaching the US. The answer wasn't immediately clear, but the initial assessment points to an ICBM, according to Pentagon spokesman Col Robert Manning, per Yonhap News Agency. Long flight: Early reports suggest the missile flew for about 50 minutes, which the Guardian reports would be a North Korean record. The Pentagon's Manning estimates it went about 620 miles, and it may have come down within 200 nautical miles of Japan's coast, reports the AP. There were conflicting reports on whether it actually flew over Japan, as previous missiles have done.

"That was wrong," says the IRS official in charge of tax-exempt groups. "That was absolutely incorrect, it was insensitive and it was inappropriate. The IRS would like to apologize for that." She swears it wasn't politically motivated, but conservatives such as Mitch McConnell are demanding a fuller accounting, and various Tea Party groups want resignations to follow. Conservative groups have been complaining for more than a year of unfair treatment by the IRS, reports the Washington Post. The back story here is that scores of political groups filed for nonprofit status last year, a distinction that puts them under the authority of the IRS instead of the Federal Election Commission, reports Politico. (One of the advantages is that they can hide donors.) The IRS agents—described as "career employees" working out of Cincinnati who got assigned to look into the increase in applications—were investigating to see whether such groups were dabbling too much in politics to qualify as nonprofits. The agency issued another statement today saying it should have done a "better job of handling the influx of advocacy applications. Mistakes were made initially, but they were in no way due to any political or partisan rationale.”

"Amen, Brother" was an instrumental B-side to a Grammy-winning hit called "Color Him Father," and it contains six seconds of drumming that have been sampled on more than 1,500 tracks, the BBC reports, pointing to data from whosampled.com. Among those who have used the beat are big names like David Bowie, Oasis, NWA, Nine Inch Nails, and Salt-N-Pepa, not to mention those behind the Futurama theme song, Rolling Stone reports. But the Winstons never received any royalties for the usage. The sampling of what's known as the "Amen Break" began in the 1980s, and at the time, the legal rules surrounding it weren't clear. The drummer who played the beat, one GC Coleman, died homeless in 2006 in Atlanta, and frontman Richard Spencer doesn't think Coleman was aware of the song's influence. But there's something of a happy ending to all this: British musicians have started an online fund to repay Spencer for the band's work, and they've collected more than $32,000 on GoFundMe. "If you have ever written or sold any music with the amen break, or even just enjoyed one of the countless hundreds and hundreds of tunes that contain … please donate towards the good cause," the campaign requests. (Jay Z also wants you to pay for music—via his new streaming service.)

A look at what the outcome means for both campaigns: One common theme: The virtual tie is an OK result for Clinton but an "ominous one" for Sanders, as this New York Times analysis argues. The thinking: Iowa Democrats are a white and liberal bunch, and Sanders should have done better. An analysis at the Week makes a similar case, with a headline referring to Sanders' "stinging defeat." If he can't win here, he's likely in big trouble in a national race, it notes. Vox has a much more optimistic take about Sanders' "remarkably strong" performance and chalks it up to young voters. Along those lines, John Cassidy at the New Yorker calls Sanders the night's "big winner." He "confirmed his capture of the Party's under-forty wing, which means trouble for Hillary Clinton"—especially if the rising Marco Rubio ends up as the GOP nominee. Politico has a glum analysis for Camp Clinton: When this campaign started, Iowa was supposed to be a resounding victory, not a "tentative first step." Clinton's "inability to ride a first-class ground organization to triumph underscores the candidate's weakness and the lack of a message that resonates with primary voters." A similar take at the Washington Post: Sanders did well with liberals, young voters, and independents, writes Karen Tumulty. "The photo finish showed that Republicans are not the only voters looking for qualities beyond experience and electability."

The reason for the latter, as spelled out in Vox, is an apparent rising concern over labor issues and Amazon's monopolistic ways. But while Palus applauds those making a statement by ditching Prime, she's not about to cast judgment on those who won't. "It’s simply not a step that everyone can take, and that’s not just because people are unwilling to forgo convenience," she writes. "It’s easy to forget, because everyone has to do it and it’s often pleasurable, but shopping is labor." Prime, especially for those struggling to make ends meet, can be "a Band-Aid, helping them save money and time," writes Palus. She talks to several people who explain why they don't feel they can give it up, including a young couple who have giant boxes of diapers delivered to their second-floor condo at a discount of 20%. She suggests that people like this who still want to support the Amazon protests can cut back in smaller ways, like not taking part in additional services such as same-day delivery. And they can also be vocal about their concerns. "Small actions, if broadcast to a social network and in turn, to politicians, can help spur that change." Read the full piece.

A fellow student is in custody, and police think a specific dispute between the two of them led to the shooting. Also of note: Police say an armed school resource officer—of the type the NRA is pushing—disarmed the suspect minutes after the shooting, though he happened to be off-duty at the time, reports AP. The school had metal detectors, and authorities are trying to figure out how the small-caliber handgun apparently got through them. The shooting reportedly took place outside in a school courtyard. "Gun violence in and around our schools is simply unconscionable and must end," said Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed. "Too many young people are being harmed, and too many families are suffering from unimaginable and unnecessary grief."

Ever since the plane disappeared in March 2014, 19-year-old Maira Elizabeth Nari has been posting messages for her father on Twitter and Instagram in the hope he's still out there somewhere, reports the New York Times. "When will you be back home. I'll be waiting, all of us are," reads one tweet. And on Instagram, she wrote, "Have a blessed Christmas with the rest of the crew and passengers." As a result, she's now got more than 90,000 Twitter followers and more than 20,000 on Instagram. She tells the Times posting notes for her father helps her deal with the frustration and confusion of possibly losing him, confusion that's now amplified given the mixed messages from Malaysian and international search officials about whether debris washing up in the Indian Ocean belongs to the plane.

Microsoft has just released the public beta version of a new Project Oxford tool that uses artificial intelligence to recognize "eight core emotional states" on people's faces in photographs. If you express anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or surprise and you show it, the tool will catch on, reports Microsoft; the eighth state it registers is "neutral." Project Oxford has been working on machine-based learning for a while now, reports Ars Technica. There's even a Movember-related sub-service, MyMoustache.net, through which users can upload images of their mustaches and get rated. Several users are already tweeting out the results of their own photos or those of famous people, reports the New York Daily News. For instance, one image of Hitler is calculated as mostly neutral (0.82048) but with smaller amounts of sadness (0.10757) and anger (0.07123) and trace amounts of contempt, disgust, fear, and surprise. The smiling cat owner next to him in the tweet, meanwhile, is 100% happy. Not all examples appear to get it exactly right, however; a forlorn-looking Keanu Reeves (aka "Sad Keanu") on a bench is only 0.01831 sad and actually 0.00035 happy, reports the Verge. (Still, it's looking better than Microsoft's age-guessing algorithm from earlier this year.)

Specifically, she wondered why Black Lives Matter is the only "problem you're allowed to talk about." “Is Beyoncé or Kendrick Lamar going to say Muslim Lives Matter? Or Syrian Lives Matter? Or this kid in Pakistan matters?" MIA continued. "That’s a more interesting question. And you cannot ask it on a song that’s on Apple, you cannot ask it on an American TV program, you cannot create that tag on Twitter, Michelle Obama is not going to hump you back.” In response to MIA's comments, one Black Lives Matter organizer said the singer "really has no clue," the Guardian reports. According to Entertainment Weekly, another Black Lives Matter activist took issue with the idea that America "allows" you to say black lives matter, as protesters doing just that were teargassed. MIA later clarified on Twitter that she wasn't criticizing anyone in particular; "My question was," she wrote, "on American platforms what do they allow you to stand up for in 2016. This has been the number 1 question for me." The issue came up when MIA was asked about Beyoncé's performance at this year's Super Bowl. MIA is no stranger to Super Bowl controversies; she was fined by the NFL for flipping the bird while performing with Madonna in 2012.

The legislation would boost the debt ceiling by $1 trillion, the Washington Post reports—though Dems say in order to avoid default, they might OK a short-term solution instead, even if it lasts just weeks. Politico, however, reports a divide between top Senate Democrats and the White House, with the former frustrated that the administration is showing flexibility. Though the administration is now distancing itself from a short-term plan, senators fear the president may be inching closer to negotiating with Republicans over the default risk. That risk is growing, with experts telling the Hill that the "drop-dead date" to raise the ceiling is, perhaps appropriately, Halloween. "The one thing we know for sure is that by Nov. 1, they will be out of money," says a Goldman Sachs analyst. That's when $67 billion in Social Security, Medicare, military, and other payments are due. Meanwhile, lawmakers are working on sending back payments to furloughed workers—but even that is running into problems. After the House unanimously passed a measure to do so, Republican Sen. John Cornyn warned that it was "premature to be dealing with that until we deal with the underlying problem," Roll Call reports. Senate Dems plan an up-or-down vote that aides say is likely to get the measure through, the Post notes. Some 70% of Americans disapprove of the GOP's budget tactics, a Post-ABC News poll finds; 61% disapprove of congressional Democrats' handling of the situation, while Obama's disapproval rating is at 51%. His approval rating, however, climbed from 41% to 45% in the past week.

Doing so would give them manufactured fingerprints that could unlock his phone and perhaps glean clues about who killed him. The New York Daily News reports Michigan cops tracked Jain down after seeing a video he posted on YouTube that got into using re-created fingerprints to unlock phones. Without getting into specific details about the still-underway investigation, Jain and his PhD student assistant fill Fusion in about the unusual investigative method. The victim had been arrested at one point, so police were able to give Jain a scan of his fingerprints; because it wasn't clear which finger the victim used to unlock his Samsung Galaxy S6, Jain will work up all 10. One particularly pesky complication: Readers rely on the conductive nature of human skin, so Jain has to add a "micron level coating" with tiny metallic pieces to the plastic fingers to make them conductive. Mashable reports he's been testing a variety of conductive materials. Whether this type of technology could be used on living suspects is another matter: Fusion notes it gets "murky," especially with Fifth Amendment protections for "contents of the mind" (a memorized password), but not for "tangible" corporeal evidence such as fingerprints. As far as the legal implications of breaking into the dead man's phone, any info found that could link the victim to any crimes wouldn't matter anyway as he's now deceased. It would a different story if cops wanted to break into the (ostensibly living) murderer's phone, notes 3DPrint.com. Jain expects to have the fingers ready for police in a few weeks. (Speaking of skin, how would you feel about clothing made from it?)

The Omaha World-Herald reports the unnamed 53-year-old man's adult children left their marijuana brownies in the back of his car. He found them Tuesday night and—unaware they were special—ate four. He started getting "bad anxiety" while watching TV, and his wife called 911. Paramedics determined the man was OK apart from his behavior: He was, as the World-Herald puts it, "crawling around on the floor, randomly using profanities, and calling the family cat 'a bitch.'" He said he felt like he was "tripping." Paramedics put the man to bed, and no charges were filed. Marijuana Politics points out minor marijuana possession hasn't been an arrestable offense in Nebraska since the 1970s.

This time, it was pictures of Reeva Steenkamp's head after she was shot that prompted the vomiting, the BBC reports. Police commander Schoombie van Rensburg described his arrival at the athlete's house following Steenkamp's death, the Telegraph reports. With paramedics on the scene and Steenkamp declared dead, "the body was covered with towels and black bags," van Rensburg said. Pistorius, who was in the kitchen, "was very emotional at that stage, and then I asked him what happened. He didn't answer. He was in tears." Van Rensburg added that Carice Stander, the daughter of the property manager, said Pistorius had called her and her father for help taking Steenkamp to the hospital. Stander and Pistorius had used the bags and towels to stop the blood, she said. The commander described following "the trail of blood up the stairs," where the bathroom door was locked. Photos showed a cricket bat and still-cocked gun on the scene, CNN reports.

The Australian government has blocked the $350 million sale of parcels of land totaling almost 40,000 square miles, citing national security issues relating to one of the enormous cattle ranches involved, reports the Guardian. The Anna Creek cattle station, which covers more than 3,000 square miles, borders South Australia's Woomera military weapons testing range. The government noted that the area up for sale covers 1.3% of Australia's landmass, and 2.6% of its agricultural land. A spokesman for S. Kidman and Co., which had been weighing bids from two Chinese companies, says he's surprised by the government's objection. "To be honest, I didn't think this would be the outcome," he tells the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. "I knew there would be concerns; however, cyber-espionage around the world seems to operate quite successfully in its own right without the need to acquire an Outback cattle property like Anna Creek."

Instead, her fashion business partner is introducing her to artists. But for now, she's enjoying the single life with "absolutely no plans on dating anytime soon," a source says. But, another source adds, "She’s been saying now that if she does date anyone, it could be someone who works in the arts world. Katie’s more interested in the quiet life now and an unassuming artist would fit the bill perfectly for when she’s ready." Then again, British magazine Grazia claims ex-fiance Chris Klein himself has actually been sneaking in to Katie's buildings for visits, Australia's News Network reports. "Chris was a real ladies' man when they were first together … he also had a major problem with alcohol," a source says. "He’s really cleaned himself up since then ... Katie likes the new Chris a whole lot more." Of course, all of this comes soon after fellow ex Jackson revealed Holmes called him up after her divorce…

You can't,” he writes on the Huffington Post. In light of that stark fact, he also has some advice for Sheen: “Take a nap. Get a shower. Call Chuck. Go on Letterman and make an apology. And then beg for your job back.” Baldwin can speak to all this because he had his own run-in with a studio executive, back when David Kirkpatrick bounced him from the sequels to The Hunt for Red October, an experience he recounts in detail in the HuffPo piece. From that, Baldwin learned that the entertainment industry is “the rock under which you find the biggest, lyingest, thievingest scumbags on Earth.” And “when you are as big a douchebag as some of these guys are, they have no choice but to snuff you,” Baldwin concludes. “Sober up, Charlie. And get back on TV, if it's not too late. This is America. You want to really piss off Chuck and Warner Brothers and CBS? Beg for America's forgiveness. They will give it to you. And then go back. You are a great television star. And you've got the gig.” One last piece of advice: “PS ... buy Cryer a really nice car.” (Click to see why Sheen’s lawsuit is not without merit.)

In a tweet, Trump thanked Kim for the "nice letter" and for keeping his promise of returning what's believed to be the remains of US soldiers who fought in the Korean War, which arrived in Hawaii on Wednesday, per the AP. "I look forward to seeing you soon!" he added. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders didn't comment on when the two leaders might meet again, but she said Kim's letter spoke of "advancing the commitments made" at their June summit, spoofed in a K-pop artist's latest music video, per CNN.

Singer Jim Peterik tells Billboard that he was "surprised and dismayed at the misuse" of the Rocky III anthem, which was played as Mike Huckabee joined Davis for a rally after her release yesterday. "The song has motivated thousands through the years to reach beyond their limits," Peterik said in a statement. "Its use for the release of Kim Davis does not support my views or my politics. I have contacted my publishers to make sure this usage is stopped immediately." Guitarist Frankie Sullivan agreed, saying in a Facebook post that he hadn't given Davis permission to use the song—and he "would not grant her the rights to use Charmin!" Sullivan told Huckabee that he's not "The Donald" but he "can do better than that," reports the Washington Post, which takes a look at the creation and history of the song. Davis, meanwhile, plans to return to work this week, but a federal judge's order says she'll go straight back to jail if she tries to block the granting of marriage licenses for same-sex couples, reports CNN, which notes that Huckabee has volunteered to go to jail in her place. (When Newt Gingrich used "Eye of the Tiger" in 2012, Survivor members not only sued him, they violated his copyright.)

And Williams, who’s prepping for Wimbledon, is getting annoyed. The US Anti-Doping Agency versus Serena situation came to a head on June 14 when a tester for the USADA went to Williams’ home in Florida at 8:30am for an unannounced test and Williams was unavailable, reports Deadspin. The tester reportedly refused to leave, but a test was never conducted. The seven-time Wimbledon champion believes she is being unfairly targeted and complained to USADA CEO Travis Tygart. Williams, who has been tested five times in 2018, according to the USADA database, is by far the most tested player in US women’s tennis. Other top US women's players have been tested once or twice in that time, if at all. She’s also been tested more than any of the top five US male players. The USADA conducts tests based on a dozen factors, among them, the players’ performance and ranking, training schedule and competition dates, information received about a player’s possible doping practices, and injury data. A spokesperson for Williams, who is seeded No. 25 for her return to Wimbledon after having a baby, per the AP, tells Deadspin that in Williams’ 23-year career she has never tested positive for drugs and she has always willingly complied with testing. “There is absolutely no reason for this kind of invasive and targeted treatment,” the rep said. When asked if there is any reason to suspect Williams of doping, USADA rep Brad Horn said, “Absolutely not.”

Until now, maybe. Scientists might have detected one in orbit around a planet in the constellation Sagittarius, reports Nature. If so, it's the first so-called exomoon to be spotted around an exoplanet. The catch: They made the discovery during a unique "microlensing event," and it's all but impossible to repeat the observation. (Discovery has more details on the phenomenon, in which a celestial object drifts into perfect alignment between the Earth and another more distant star, and "the space-time bending gravitational field of the closest object" brightens the light of the more distant one.) After logging the microlensing event in June 2011 and analyzing it, astronomers believe the "closest object" could be a small star orbited by a Neptune-size planet, or a good-sized planet with its own moon. "It’s kind of a shame because we’ll probably never know what the answer is," says one astronomer not involved with the research. Still, "the exomoon evidence is tantalizing," writes Ian O'Neill at Discovery.
