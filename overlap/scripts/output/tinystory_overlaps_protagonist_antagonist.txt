He liked running around the beach, chasing after sticks and playing in the sand. One day, he came across the most attractive sandcastle he had ever seen. Bouncer wanted to play with it, so he started to tremble around it.

But what Bouncer didn't know was that, deep inside, there was a grumpy old man who hated having his sandcastle played with. So, when Bouncer started to tremble around it, the man growled and chased him away.

Bouncer was so sad that he couldn't play with the sandcastle. He lay in the sand and thought about how he should have known better. He started to realize that even though something appears attractive on the outside, you should never disturb it if it belongs to someone else.

The moral of this story is that if something is not yours, be respectful and don't try to take it. Respect other people's property and belongings, even if they seem attractive.

They had fun throwing leaves at each other and making noises.

"Look, Ben, I find something!" Tom said, holding up a shiny thing.

"What is it?" Ben asked, coming closer.

"It is a watch. It is pretty and has numbers on it. Maybe it is magic!" Tom said, putting it on his wrist.

"Let me see!" Ben said, trying to grab it.

"No, it is mine! I find it!" Tom said, pulling away.

They started to fight over the watch and did not see the man who was lying under the leaves. He was wearing a suit and had blood on his face. He was dead. He was the owner of the watch and someone had killed him.

Suddenly, they heard a loud noise and saw a car stop near the pile of leaves. Two men got out of the car and looked angry. They had guns in their hands and saw the boys with the watch.

"Hey, you little rats! Give us back the watch! It is ours!" one of the men shouted.

The boys were scared and tried to run away, but the men were faster and caught them. They took the watch and dragged the boys to the car.

"Let us go! Help! Help!" the boys cried, but no one heard them.

The men threw the boys in the trunk of the car and drove away. They were going to hurt them and make them tell where they found the watch. The boys wished they had never found the watch or the dead man in the suit. They wished they had stayed home and played with their toys. They wished they had listened to their mom who told them not to go to the park alone. But it was too late. They were in big trouble and did not know what to do. They were very sad and afraid.

It barked very loud.

"Let's go and pet the dog!" Ben said. He liked dogs.

"No, Ben, don't!" Lily said. She was scared of dogs. "The dog might bite you!"

But Ben did not listen. He ran to the dog. The dog did not like Ben. It growled and snapped at him. Ben tried to run away, but the dog was faster. It bit Ben on the leg. Ben screamed and fell down.

Lily ran to help Ben. She saw blood on his leg. She cried and hugged him. The dog ran away. Lily and Ben were alone in the park.

"Ben, are you okay?" Lily asked. She trembled with fear.

"It hurts, Lily, it hurts!" Ben said. He sobbed and shook.

Lily did not know what to do. She wished someone would come and help them. She wished they had not gone to the park. She wished they had stayed home and done some exercise instead. She wished they had never seen the orange dog.
