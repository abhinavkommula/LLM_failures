This policy, as reported by the BBC, revolves around abstract actions like 'prioritizing well-being over GDP' and 'shifting towards a more sustainable economic model'. While the intention behind the policy is to address long-term challenges like climate change and social inequality, there is a growing debate about the tangible effects of such a strategy. Financial Times analysts argue that the lack of concrete metrics and clear implementation plans makes it difficult to assess the potential impact of this policy shift. Critics are concerned about the practicality of measuring 'well-being' and integrating it into economic policies, pointing out the challenges in moving away from established indicators like GDP.
