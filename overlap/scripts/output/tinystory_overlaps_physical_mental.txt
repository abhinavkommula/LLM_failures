They gave him a carrot nose and two buttons for eyes. They were very happy.

But then the wind started to blow. It was very cold and strong. It made the snow fly in the air. It made the snowman's hat and scarf fall off. It made Tom and Lily shiver.

They ran to their house. They wanted to be warm and cozy. But when they got to the door, they saw something terrible. The wind had blown a big branch from a tree. It had hit their roof. It had made a big hole in it. Snow was falling inside their house.

Tom and Lily were scared and sad. They did not know what to do. They hugged each other and cried. They wished the wind would stop. They wished their roof was fixed. They wished their snowman was still there.

Every day the train drove through the countryside, bringing joy to everyone it passed. 

One day, a little girl named Sarah was out exploring near the tracks. As she was looking around, she spotted the train coming in the distance. She had never been so close to a train before! 

She started to run towards it, but halfway there she slipped and stumbled on the grass. She started to cry, until the driver of the train spotted her. He was very generous and stopped the train so he could help her.

The driver invited Sarah to climb onto the footplate and when she sat on the engine he said "Right Sarah, hold onto my hand and lets go for a slide!" Sarah smiled and agreed. Together, they slid around the footplate, feeling the warm air on their faces.  

As Sarah waved goodbye, the driver said: "Remember, be careful and never run too close to the tracks". Sarah thanked him and ran back home, happier than ever. 

This story teaches us that it is important to be generous, follow the rules and be safe. It also teaches us the power of kindness.

Then one day, he flew by a lake and noticed two children who were skipping across the rocks and water. He was so excited to see them having so much fun and he wanted to join them. He flew down and perched on a nearby branch.

The children were delighted to see the little raven and invited him to join their game. He hopped from one rock to another and almost as if he was skipping, made it all the way across. He was completely exhausted at the end of the game, but amazingly, he had done it all without flapping his wings.

The children were so impressed by the ravenâ€™s jumping skills that they gave him a big hug and invited him to play again the next day. The persistent little raven had a lot of fun playing the game with the children and their friendship lasted for many years.

The lily was ancient and had been there for a very long time. 

One day, a little girl came to the garden. She saw the lily and wanted to pick it. But the lily didn't want to be picked. It yielded to the wind, but not to the little girl. 

The little girl understood that the lily was special and didn't want to be picked. She left the garden, but promised to come back and visit the lily again. And so, the ancient lily continued to grow in the old garden, happy to yield to the wind but not to those who wanted to take it away.

They also liked to look at the big metal thing that was in the corner of the park. It was shiny and had wheels and buttons and lights. Sam and Lily did not know what it was, but they wanted to find out.

One day, they decided to go closer to the metal thing. They looked around and saw no one was watching. They ran to the metal thing and climbed on it. They felt excited and curious. They pushed the buttons and turned the wheels. They heard some noises and saw some lights. They thought they were having fun.

But then, something happened. The metal thing started to move. It moved very fast and very loud. It went out of the park and onto the road. Sam and Lily were scared and surprised. They did not know how to stop the metal thing. They saw cars and people and buildings. They heard horns and sirens and shouts. They wanted to go back to the park.

"Help! Help!" they cried. "We don't like this metal thing! We want to get off!"

Soon, a big red truck came and stopped the metal thing. Some men in blue clothes came and helped Sam and Lily get off. They were very angry and stern. They asked Sam and Lily why they were on the metal thing. They told them it was a tractor and it was not a toy. They told them they could have hurt themselves or others. They told them they were very naughty and they had to go home.

Sam and Lily felt very embarrassed and sorry. They said they were sorry and they did not know it was a tractor. They said they just wanted to play and see what it was. They said they would never do it again.

The men in blue clothes called Sam and Lily's parents and told them what happened. Sam and Lily's parents came and took them home. They were very worried and upset. They hugged Sam and Lily and told them they were glad they were safe. They also told them they were very disappointed and they had to be punished. They said they could not go to the park for a long time and they had to say sorry to the men in blue clothes and the tractor owner.

Sam and Lily felt very ashamed and sad. They learned their lesson. They realized they should not touch things they did not know and they should listen to their parents. They hoped they could go to the park again someday and play with the swings, the slide and the seesaw. But they never wanted to see the metal thing again.

Lily felt sad. She did not mean to be naughty. She wanted to make her mom smile. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I love you. I wanted to give you a surprise."

Her mom hugged her and said, "I love you too, Lily. But you have to be careful with crayons. They can make a mess. Come on, let's wash the wall together."

Lily and her mom got some water and a cloth. They rubbed the wall until the black crayon was gone. It took a long time and a lot of water. Lily learned her lesson. She said, "Next time, I will draw on paper, not on the wall."

Her mom smiled and said, "That's a good idea, Lily. And next time, I will give you a surprise too. How about some cookies?"

Tom did not want water or milk or mint tea. He wanted juice. He was angry and sad. He said, "That's not fair. Sara gets mint tea and I get nothing. I don't like mint tea. I don't like Sara. She is always sick and gets everything."

Mom said, "Tom, that's not nice. You should not be jealous of Sara. She is sick and needs mint tea to heal. You are healthy and strong and can play and eat. You should be happy and kind. You should help Sara and share with her. Maybe you can read her a story or draw her a picture. That will make her happy and help her heal faster."

One day, Julia was out playing hide and seek with her friends.

Suddenly, they saw a man with an axe in his hand. He was coming towards them. Julia's friends quickly ran away and hid, but Julia was too scared to move.

The man came up to Julia and said, "What is your name?" Julia was too scared to answer. He said, "If you don't tell me your name, I will attach my axe to you!"

Julia said, "My name is Julia." But it was too late. The man attached the axe to her, and she cried and screamed until she was out of breath. Then, the man disappeared and Julia was left alone with the axe still attached to her.

The bad ending was that Julia was stuck with the axe attached to her for the rest of her life.

He was very talented, but he was always very humble about it. 

One day, Bert went to a park to paint. He started to paint a lovely picture of a tree, but he was having a bit of trouble with it. So he put his paintbrush down, and asked for help. 

That's when he saw the most extraordinary sight. There was a 3 year old girl, holding a paintbrush, working away on a painting. She was so confident and so talented, even at such a young age. Bert was amazed! He approached her and asked if she'd help him with his painting.

The little girl smiled and nodded her head. She showed Bert exactly how to paint the tree. She was so patient and so kind. Before long, the painting was finished and it looked wonderful. Bert thanked her very much, and they said goodbye. 

Bert learned a valuable lesson that day. Even if a person is very young, they can still work like a true painter.

The noise was getting closer. Danny was scared.

"I'm coming to get you!" He heard someone yell. Danny tried to run but he wasn't fast enough. Just then, an old man appeared from behind a tall tree. Danny was about to run away when the man said, "Don't worry, you can be my friend". Danny was surprised and a little scared. 

The man sat down and said gently. "If you want, I can take you to a very special place. Would you like that?" Danny was so excited. He said yes and the man smiled. 

The man then took Danny to a clearing in the forest. "Look," he said, gesturing to the far horizon, "you can see something special in the distance." Danny squinted, and there it was - a double rainbow in the sky. Danny smiled and took a deep breath. He was happy.

They told her that university was a place where you could study many things and become successful.

One day, Anna went to visit her mom at her office. Her mom worked at the university, where she taught other people about animals. Anna loved animals, and she was excited to see her mom's office. She saw many books, pictures, and toys of different animals.

"Mom, can I play with the animals?" Anna asked.

"Sure, honey, but be careful and quiet. Some of the animals are sleeping or shy," her mom said.

Anna nodded and picked up a toy lion. She pretended that the lion was roaring and chasing a zebra. She made loud noises with her mouth and moved the lion around.

"RAWR! I'm a lion! I'm hungry!" Anna shouted.

"Shh, Anna, you're too loud. You'll scare the animals and the people," her mom said.

But Anna didn't hear her mom. She was having too much fun with the lion. She shouted louder and louder, until she heard a loud bark.

Anna turned around and saw a real dog. The dog was big and brown, and it looked angry. It was barking at Anna and the lion.

"WOOF! WOOF! GO AWAY!" the dog shouted.

Anna was scared. She dropped the lion and ran to her mom. She hugged her mom and cried.

"Mom, the dog shouted at me! He doesn't like me or the lion!" Anna said.

Her mom hugged her back and calmed her down.

"It's okay, Anna. The dog is not mean. He is just protecting his territory. He thinks the lion is a threat. He doesn't know that the lion is a toy," her mom said.

"Really?" Anna asked.

"Yes, really. The dog is a guard dog. He works at the university, too. He helps keep the place safe. He is a good dog, but he doesn't like loud noises. You have to be quiet and respectful when you're here," her mom said.

"I'm sorry, mom. I didn't know. I was just playing. I won't shout anymore," Anna said.

"That's good, Anna. I'm glad you understand. Now, why don't we go and say sorry to the dog and give him a treat? Maybe he'll be your friend," her mom said.

"Okay, mom. Let's go. I hope he likes me," Anna said.

They walked to the dog and smiled. The dog stopped barking and wagged his tail. He sniffed the treat and licked Anna's hand.

"Hi, dog. I'm sorry I shouted. I was playing with the lion. He's not real. He's a toy. Do you want to play with me?" Anna asked.

The dog barked softly and nodded. He took the lion and tossed it in the air. He caught it and ran around.

"YAY! He likes me! He likes the lion! He wants to play!" Anna shouted.

But this time, she didn't shout too loud. She shouted with joy and happiness. And the dog shouted with her. They became friends and played together.

Anna's mom smiled and watched them. She was proud of her daughter. She knew that Anna was a smart and kind girl. She knew that Anna would go to university someday and become successful. And she knew that Anna would always love animals.

"Tom, are you okay?" Lily said. She hugged him.

So, she quickly walked away. But, Jane was curious and kept looking back at the high circle of frowning people.

Suddenly, Jane heard a loud voice coming from the circle. It was a friendly voice and it said "Don't be scared, Jane. We're just playing a game!" Jane felt a little bit better, so she walked back and joined the circle.

The people smiled at Jane and they started to explain their game. They said that the game was called "Circle of Highs and Lows", which meant that they took turns to share something that was high and something that was low.

Everyone smiled and laughed and at the end of the game, they all gave Jane a big hug. Jane was so happy that she joined the circle of friends, and she decided to come back to join them every day!

But the yarn had a big knot in it. Lily tried to pull the knot, but it was too tight. Ben tried to twist the knot, but it was too hard.

"Let's cut the knot," Lily said. She got a pair of scissors from the table. She was careful with the scissors. She knew they were sharp and could hurt.

"No, don't cut the knot," Ben said. He liked the knot. He thought it was fun and special. He wanted to keep the knot.

"But the knot is in the way," Lily said. "We can't make anything with the yarn if the knot is there."

"But the knot is part of the yarn," Ben said. "We can make something with the knot too."

Lily and Ben looked at each other. They did not agree. They did not know what to do.

Then they heard a voice. It was Mom. She came into the room. She saw the ball of yarn and the knot and the scissors.

"What are you doing, kids?" Mom asked.

"We are playing with the yarn," Lily said.

"But we have a problem," Ben said.

"What is the problem?" Mom asked.

Lily and Ben showed Mom the knot. They told her their different ideas.

Mom smiled. She was a dependable mom. She always helped them when they had problems.

"I have an idea," Mom said. "Why don't we make two balls of yarn? One with the knot and one without. Then you can both play with the yarn the way you like."

Lily and Ben liked Mom's idea. They thought it was fair and smart. They thanked Mom and gave her a hug.

Mom cut the yarn carefully. She made two balls of yarn. One with the knot and one without. She gave one ball to Lily and one ball to Ben.

Lily and Ben were happy. They played with their balls of yarn. They made shapes and patterns with the yarn. They shared and took turns. They had fun.

One day, Daisy went outside to play. She saw a pond filled with water that was quite still. Daisy had a great idea. She went to get a stick and started stirring the waters, to make them change.

The water began to move faster and faster. Daisy was very careful not to splash any water on herself. After stirring for a long time, the water became a beautiful wave and all the fishes swimming inside had so much fun!

Daisy decided it was time to go home. She saw that some little birds were splashing around too, so Daisy stopped to say hello. "Hello there, little birds!" said Daisy. "Thank you for making the water so much fun!"

The birds were so surprised to hear a human being so polite! They cawed and flew away in excitement.

Daisy went home feeling very happy. She turned the still water into a wave and made some little birds very happy. It was a great day!

Jimmy knew he had to move but he couldn't. He was too scared. Suddenly, a powerful arrow flew through the air, straight towards Jimmy. With one last scared scream, the arrow hit Jimmy and he fell to the ground. 

John ran away and never returned to the woods. He was so sad that Jimmy died. 

The end.

One day, Anna was skipping through the fields full of flowers. As she skipped, she spotted something very rare. She spotted a single purple grape nestling in between two green ones.

Anna stopped and exclaimed, "Look at the grape! It's so rare!"

But when she tried to pick it, it was too high up. She asked her mom, "How can I get the grape?"

Her mom smiled and replied, "Just wait, my darling. I'll help you get it". So, with a little bit of standing on tiptoes and reaching, Anna's mom was able to pick the grape and hand it to her daughter.

Anna beamed with happiness, thanked her mom and skipped off home with a rare grape for her lunch.

One day, Jane and Sam were walking through the park. As they were exploring, they stumbled upon a pocket on the ground. Jane said to Sam, "I found a pocket! What would you do if it was yours?" 

Sam replied, "Well, I would put my treasures in it and make sure they never get lost!" 

Jane got an idea. She quickly reached down and grabbed the pocket. Then, she held it close to her heart and said, "Let's make it a game. Let's see who can fill their pocket with the most treasures!"

The two of them ran around and found some really special things. Jane eventually filled her pocket up with so many things that she could barely carry it. Sam, however, still had space in his pocket.

When they got home, Jane pulled out her pocket and gasped in shock. She had lost all of her treasures somewhere! She had been so playful and careless that she had lost her pocket full of treasures. 

Sam laughed and said, "I told you, never lose your treasures!"

Every day, they would go out together. One day, they decided to take a walk in the park.

As they walked, Jim and Sam saw a big, green field full of wildflowers. They started to move around, jumping and running. It was so fun! They felt like they could do anything they wanted.

Then, they heard something. It sounded like a whistle. They looked around and saw a bird, flying above them, with a bright yellow beak. It was singing a charming song and it made the friends smile.

But, the forest was full of tall trees and the fox could not get over them. The fox started to struggle and try to figure out what to do.

Then, the fox had a thoughtful idea. He started to inch his way up the side of the trees. The fox used his sharp claws to grip the bark and slowly start to climb. With each inch he was able to go a bit higher and higher.

Finally, after a lot of hard work and struggling, the fox made it to the other side of the forest. He was so relieved and happy. The fox learned from this journey that persistence pays off! He thanked his thoughtful idea for helping him make it to the other side of the forest.

One day the rabbit was feeling very cold, so he decided to split some wood from a nearby tree to make a fire. 

He began to chop away at the wood but was soon stopped by a fierce fox! The fox had noticed the rabbit splitting his wood, and he didn't like it one bit.

The fox said, "What do you think you are doing?" 

"I'm cold," replied the rabbit. "I thought I'd make a fire to keep warm."

"No," said the fox, "you're not allowed to split the wood. It's my wood!"

The rabbit was scared but he stayed brave, so he said, "It's okay, I was only splitting some wood. It's harmless."

The fox thought about this for a moment and then he said, "Okay, fine. But don't do it again!"

The rabbit agreed and then he quickly finished splitting the wood and started a fire. He felt much warmer and was very pleased that he had solved the problem with the fox in a harmless way.

They flew high and they flew low, but they couldn't find anything. Suddenly, they spotted something interesting in the nearby park - jelly! The birds knew that jelly was yummy and they all wanted some. They swooped down to the ground and surrounded the jelly.

The birds all had an idea. One of them suggested that they wrap the jelly tightly with their wings so that they could take it back to their nest. All three of them agreed and they started to wrap the jelly together. They worked together, wrapping the jelly until it was completely covered.

Once the jelly was safely wrapped, the birds flew away with their yummy treat. Only one problem - it started to slip! But, these three wise birds were prepared and held it securely until they arrived back at the nest.

Once there, the birds unwrapped the jelly and shared it with their friends. Everyone was very happy and enjoyed the treat. The three birds were very proud of their hard work and wise planning, and all enjoyed the delicious jelly.

Tim sat under a tree and started to pour the candy into his palm. He counted the candies one by one. His friend, Lily, saw him and asked, "Tim, can I have some candy too?" Tim looked at her and said, "No, this is all for me."

One day, he found a big bush full of blueberries near his tree.

The wise owl knew that he needed to prevent the other animals from eating all the blueberries. He thought of a plan to keep the blueberries safe. The owl told the other animals that a big, scary monster would come if they ate the blueberries.

The other animals were scared and did not want to meet the monster. So, they stayed away from the blueberry bush. The wise owl was happy because he could eat all the blueberries by himself. And that is how the wise owl prevented the other animals from eating his favorite snack.

"I'm very well, thank you, Mrs. Blue. You have a lovely hat," Tom said, making his doll with a blue hat speak.

They smiled and nodded their dolls at each other. They were having fun.

But then, they heard a loud noise. It was their dog, Spot, who had jumped over the fence and ran into the garden. He saw the dolls and thought they were toys for him. He barked and wagged his tail and ran towards them.

"Spot, no!" Tom and Anna shouted. They tried to grab their dolls, but it was too late. Spot snatched Mrs. Pink and Mrs. Blue in his mouth and ran away with them.

"Give them back, Spot! They are not your toys!" Tom and Anna cried. They chased after Spot, but he was too fast. He ran around the garden, shaking and chewing the dolls.

Tom and Anna felt very sad. They loved their dolls. They had played with them for a long time. They did not want Spot to ruin them.

They stopped and looked at each other. They did not know what to do. They did not want to be angry with Spot, because he was their friend. But they also did not want to lose their dolls, because they were their treasures.

They felt a big silence in their hearts.

"What should we do?" Anna asked Tom.

Tom shrugged. He did not have an answer. He did not know how to make things better. He wished Spot would understand and give them back their dolls.

He wished they could have their tea party again. He wished they could be happy again.

She gives some of her pictures to her mom and dad, and they put them on the wall. Lily is glad when they say they like her pictures.

One day, Lily sees a violin in a store window. She thinks it is a big and shiny stick with strings. She wants to touch it and make sounds with it. She asks her mom if she can have it. Her mom says no, it is too expensive and too hard to play. Lily is sad and cries.

Her mom hugs her and says, "I know you like the violin, but you are too little to play it. Maybe when you are bigger, you can learn how to play it. But for now, why don't you print a picture of the violin with your crayons? You are very good at printing, and you can make it any color you want."

Lily thinks that is a good idea. She goes home and prints a picture of the violin with her crayons. She makes it pink and purple and green. She shows it to her mom and dad, and they say it is a beautiful picture. Lily is glad again. She puts her picture on the wall next to her other pictures. She says, "Maybe one day I will play the violin, but for now I like to print it."

"Oh, Tom, I am sorry. I did not know. I thought it was a good sauce. I will get you some water. Do not cry," she says.

She runs to the kitchen and gets a glass of water. She brings it to Tom and helps him drink it. She hugs him and says she is sorry again.

Paulina yelped and screamed in surprise. Her friends laughed because they knew bees were harmless.

Paulina was embarrassed but then one of her friends said something wise: "It is okay to be scared of things you don't know about. But next time, don't scream and take take a closer look. If you take a closer look, you might learn something new!"

He wanted to play with his toys, but his mom said it was time to eat breakfast. Joe was stubborn and he said no. He wanted to keep playing. 

Joe's mom said, "Joe, you must eat breakfast. It will give you energy for the day."

Joe shook his head. He felt frustrated and he didn't want to eat. 

His mom said, "It's okay to be stubborn sometimes, Joe, but it's important to listen too. When you listen, you can learn new things and stay strong and healthy." 

Joe thought about this for a moment, and he knew his mom was right. He wanted to stay strong and full of energy, so he went to the kitchen and ate his breakfast. 

The moral of the story is that being stubborn can be okay, as long as we also listen and learn.

They run to the house and ask their mom for some food for the snowman. Mom is very helpful. She gives them some bread and cheese and a cup of hot chocolate.

But something is wrong. The snowman does not eat or drink. He does not smile or talk. He starts to melt.

The hot chocolate is too hot for the snowman. It makes him melt. His hat and scarf fall off. His carrot nose and rock eyes drop to the ground. He becomes a small pile of snow.

Sam and Mia are very sad. They hug each other and cry.

"Sorry, snowman!" Sam says. "We did not mean to hurt you!"

They go back to the house and tell their mom what happened. Mom is very kind. She hugs them and wipes their tears.

Sam and Mia nod. They feel a little better. They hope to make another snowman soon. They will be more careful next time. They will still be helpful, but they will also be smart.

Lily and Tom looked at each other and remembered that they had a jar of honey in their hut. They had found it in a tree and brought it home. They had planned to eat it later, but now they had a better idea. They nodded and said, "Yes, we have honey. You can have it if you leave us alone."

They gave the bear the jar of honey and watched him lick it with his tongue. He seemed to like it very much and thanked them. He said, "You are very kind and brave. I'm sorry I scared you. I'll go now and leave you in peace. Goodbye, little ones."

He turned around and walked away, leaving the jar empty. Lily and Tom felt relieved and happy. They closed the door and waited for their mom. They hoped she would not be angry that they gave away their honey. They decided to tell her the truth and hope she would understand. They learned that sometimes, sharing can save the day.

One of her favorite things to do in the garden was care for her plants. She would water them every day and give them lots of love and attention. 

One day, Rose noticed something strange. Her plant was sick! She tried to figure out what was wrong but couldn't find the problem. She tried to heal it with water and love but nothing seemed to work. 

Rose was sad and didn't know what to do. She decided to take a clear and sunny walk around the garden to clear her mind. Suddenly, she heard a chirp from the sky. It was a bird singing a song about healing. Rose knew then what she had to do.

She returned to her plant and softly sang the bird's song. With each verse she sang, the plant slowly started to heal. Rose kept singing until the plant was back to its old, clear and healthy self and was full of life. Rose was happy that her little plant was healed.

She did not like to share or to wait or to listen.

One day, she saw a brilliant house in a book. It was big and pink and had many windows and flowers. Lily wanted to live in that house. She said to her mom, "I demand that house! Give me that house now!"

Her mom said, "No, Lily, you cannot have that house. That house is not real. It is only in the book. And you cannot demand things like that. You have to be polite and respectful and grateful for what you have."

Lily did not like what her mom said. She got angry and threw the book on the floor. She cried and screamed and kicked. She said, "I don't care! I want that house! I want that house!"

Her mom was very sad and disappointed. She picked up the book and hugged Lily. She said, "Lily, I love you, but you have to stop acting like this. You have to learn to be happy with your own house. Your own house is also brilliant. It is cozy and warm and has many toys and books and pictures. And it has us, your family, who love you very much. Don't you love your own house and your family?"

Lily stopped crying and looked at her mom. She thought about her own house and her family. She realized that her mom was right. She said, "I'm sorry, mom. I love you and I love our house and our family. I don't need that other house. Can we read the book together?"

Her mom smiled and said, "Of course, Lily. I'm glad you understand. Let's read the book together and enjoy the brilliant house in the book. But remember, it is only a book, and the most brilliant house is the one where you are loved."

"Hey Drake, want to play?" asked Zeke.

"Sure!" said Drake.

The two friends started playing and soon found a mud puddle. They both grabbed some mud and started to make silly shapes out of it. They squished and squeezed the mud, giggling as they played. 

Suddenly, Zeke grabbed too much mud and made a big pile. He took a step back and slipped, falling into the mud. 

"Ahh!" cried Zeke as he lay in the mud. 

He couldn't get up. Drake tried to help, but the mud was too slippery. Eventually, Zeke had to stay in the mud puddle, feeling silly and sad.

One day, Sam was feeling very miserable. He didn't know why he felt so sad, but he just couldn't make any more music.

So Sam went on a journey to find a magical place. He wanted to find a place where he could make his music and be happy again.

Sam walked for miles and miles until he came to a clearing. He looked around and saw birds chirping and colourful flowers blooming. Everywhere looked magical.

Then, Sam heard a sound like trumpets in the air. He looked up and there was a group of Jazz birds flying in a circle. He was so happy!

But, as soon as he got close, the Jazz birds disappeared. Sam was very sad. He wanted to make music with them.

Suddenly, something caught his eye. It was a shiny golden record in the middle of the clearing. Sam picked it up and, in a blink of an eye, all the Jazz birds came back!

Sam was so excited that he forgot how miserable he had been and started to dance. The Jazz birds joined in and they all had the best party ever.

He saw an ant crawling on the ground. He picked up the ant gently and put it in the hole. The ant fit perfectly.

"Look, Lila, I made something original!" Tom said, proudly. "I made a tower with an ant on top. The ant is the king of the tower."

They loved to play in the castle, discovering all the fun places. One day, Sammy had a great plan! He wanted to explore what was behind the big door at the end of the hallway.

Sally was a bit scared of the door. But Sammy said, "Let's just open it and see what's inside, I'm sure it will be fun". With a bit of courage, Sally followed Sammy to the door.

They both pushed the door open, but instead of finding something fun, a big monster came out from behind it!

Sally screamed. The monster said "Why did you open the door? You should learn to think before you do something".

The two bears quickly ran away, feeling very scared and sad. From that day on, Sammy always reminded Sally that it's important to think about the consequences of your actions, before you plan to do something.

One day, they found a flower they had never seen before. It was purple and white, and had four petals that looked like stars. It was hidden under a big leaf. Lila and Ben were very curious and excited.

"Look, Ben, look!" Lila said. "A rare flower! It is so pretty!"

"Wow, Lila, wow!" Ben said. "Can we pick it and take it home?"

"No, Ben, no!" Lila said. "We have to leave it here. It is rare, and maybe it will bloom more. We can come back and see it again."

"OK, Lila, OK," Ben said. "But can we touch it? Just a little bit?"

Lila and Ben reached out their hands to touch the rare flower. But as soon as they touched it, something strange happened. The flower made a loud noise, like a bee, and the petals moved like wings. It flew up in the air and landed on a branch. It was not a flower, it was a butterfly!

One day, he was acting like his favorite superhero when he accidentally knocked over the drain in his backyard. The water from the drain started flowing everywhere! He tried to stop it with his hands and feet, but he couldn't do it.

Billy and Betty were very nosy. They wanted to know how the pen had gotten there. So, they very carefully parted the grass until they found the answer. There was a big crack in the ground, and the pen had fallen right into it!

Billy and Betty had saved the day. Now it was time to go off and have more fun in the sunshine. They said goodbye to their new pen friend, and ran happily off hand-in-hand. The end.

Mia nods. She finds a stick on the floor. It is from their puzzle. She gives it to Ben. Ben takes the stick and walks slowly to the wall. He reaches out and pokes the spider with the stick.

However, when the girl got close, she saw something strange. There was a giant nest in the middle of the island and it was full of big eggs.

Confused, the girl started to look around and she soon discovered there was an enormous bird standing next to the nest.

The bird welcomed the girl and offered her an egg. The bird said, "This egg is special. If you take this egg and take it to a safe place, you can have the island all to yourself."

The girl thought it was a good deal - the island looked easy to explore and she accepted the bird's offer. She carefully picked up the egg, got back in her boat, and sailed away.

Soon she found another island, far away from where she had found the bird. She gently placed the egg on a beach, and as soon as she did, the island belonged to her.

But there was a little boy named Tim who wanted to see the cliff. Tim loved to stretch his arms wide open and pretend he could fly. He thought that if he could stretch near the cliff, he could feel like he was flying.

One sunny day, Tim went to the cliff when no one was looking. He stood at the edge and started to stretch his arms wide open. He felt so happy, like a bird in the sky. But the wind blew strong and Tim almost fell. He was scared.

Just then, Tim's dad came running and grabbed him. He pulled Tim away from the edge, making him safe. Tim's dad had seen him leave and knew he was going to the cliff. Tim hugged his dad and promised never to go near the cliff again. From that day on, Tim only stretched his arms in the safe park with his friends.

They pretended that the boats were sailing to different ports around the world. They also pretended that they were wealthy and had many things on their boats.

One day, Tom wanted to play with Anna's boat. He said, "Anna, can I have your boat? It is bigger and nicer than mine. I want to go to the port of China and trade for silk and spices."

Anna refused to give Tom her boat. She said, "No, Tom, this is my boat. You have your own boat. You can go to the port of Africa and trade for gold and ivory."

Tom was angry and tried to grab Anna's boat. Anna pulled it away and splashed water on Tom. Tom splashed water back on Anna. They started to fight and shout.

Their mother heard the noise and came to the bathroom. She saw the water on the floor and the children fighting. She was not happy. She said, "Tom and Anna, stop fighting right now. You are making a mess and being rude. You need to share your toys and play nicely. If you don't, I will take away your boats and you will have no ports to visit."

Tom and Anna stopped fighting and looked at their mother. They did not want to lose their boats. They said, "Sorry, mother. We will share and play nicely. We will also clean up the water."

Their mother smiled and said, "That's good. I'm glad you learned your lesson. Now, why don't you take turns with your boats and visit different ports together? You can learn about different places and cultures and have fun."

Tom and Anna agreed and hugged their mother. They decided to play together and visit different ports with their boats. They also decided to be more grateful for what they had and not be greedy for what they did not have. They realized that being wealthy was not as important as being kind and respectful.

Brownie loved her hay, but one day it started to rot. She sniffed the pile and pushed it away in disgust. Brownie knew this didn't seem right. She had to find out what was happening!

Brownie hurried around the barn, searching for the culprit. She barked and growled as she looked, but still couldn't find anyone. That night, as Brownie was lying in her bed, she heard odd crunching noises coming from the hay pile. She jumped up and sure enough, there was a sneaky rat poking around her hay.

Brownie barked and lunged at the rat, scaring it away. Brownie felt relieved - her loyal vigilance had saved the day. From then on she kept a close eye on the hay pile, making sure that no rat could ever bother it again.

Mom looked at the yacht and smiled. She was not surprised. She knew why it shrank. She had bought it from a special store that sold toys that changed size when they got wet. She thought it would be fun for Tom and Lily to play with.

"Your yacht shrank because it is a special yacht. It can grow big or small when it touches water. It is not a bad toy, it is a fun toy. Do you want to see?" Mom said.

"Wow, Mom, that is so cool! Can we play with it again?" Tom and Lily said.

"Of course you can. But be careful not to lose it when it is small. And don't put it in your mouth. It is not a candy." Mom said.

One day, Lily and her dad went on a boat ride. They saw a big anchor and Lily asked her dad what it was. Her dad said it was used to keep the boat from moving.

As they were sailing, Lily saw a beautiful seashell in the water. She asked her dad if she could jump in and get it. Her dad said no because it was too dangerous. But Lily didn't listen and jumped in anyway. She quickly realized she couldn't swim and started to panic.

Her dad tried to save her, but it was too late. Lily's mom came to the dock and saw what happened. She regretted not being there to stop Lily from jumping in. Everyone was very sad and it was a bad ending to their boat ride.

John asked his mother for permission to go and explore the fields. She warned him not to go too far, but he decided to ignore her warning and headed out to the fields anyways. As he walked he noticed something odd ahead of him. It looked like a person. "Hey there, who are you?" he asked.

The person didn't answer, but simply turned towards him and smiled an evil smile, then walked away. John felt uneasy and thought it might be better to go back home, but it was too late. Suddenly the person he saw earlier appeared again, this time accompanied by four more. They surrounded John, eyes staring darkly. One of them spoke. "We've been watching you" they said.

Polly nodded. She said, "Yes, I want to play with you. I like to fly and talk and learn new words. Can you teach me some words?"

Sam and Mia clapped their hands. They said, "Yes, we can teach you some words. Come down, Polly. Let's play together."

One day, they went on a trip to a cabin in the woods. Lily was so excited to explore the cabin and play outside.

But when they arrived, Lily felt frightened. The cabin looked old and spooky. She didn't want to go inside. Her mom told her to be brave and open the door. Lily took a deep breath and turned the doorknob. When she saw the cozy inside of the cabin, she felt much better.

One day, they saw a big tree with many fruits on it. The fruits were red and round and shiny. They looked very yummy.

"Let's pick some fruits and eat them," Ben said.

"But the tree is not ours. It belongs to Mr. Fox. He is very mean and scary. He does not like children," Lily said.

"We can be very quiet and fast. He will not see us or hear us," Ben said. He was very brave and clever.

They went to the tree and climbed on it. They picked some fruits and put them in their pockets. They were very happy and hungry. They wanted to taste the fruits.

But Mr. Fox was not asleep. He heard a noise in his tree. He opened his eyes and saw two children stealing his fruits. He was very angry and hungry. He wanted to catch them and eat them.

He jumped out of his house and ran to the tree. He shouted and growled and showed his teeth.

Lily and Ben were very scared. They saw Mr. Fox coming. They dropped their fruits and slid down the tree. They ran to the fence and tried to climb over it.

"Help me, Lily!" Ben whispered. He was stuck on the fence. His shirt was caught on a nail.

"Wait, Ben! I will help you!" Lily whispered. She was very kind and intelligent. She pulled his shirt and freed him from the nail.

They jumped over the fence and ran to their home. They were safe and glad. They hugged each other and laughed.

They learned a lesson. They should not take things that are not theirs. They should respect Mr. Fox and his tree. They should be happy with what they have. They still had each other. They were still best friends.

Jill wanted to join Jack. She put one foot out and started to spin with him. It felt so silly! Soon the two friends were spinning together and laughing so hard that their tummies hurt.

They spun and spun until they were too tired to spin anymore. When they stopped they were so dizzy they could barely stand. 

But even still, it was one of their best days ever because they had so much fun spinning together at the sea.
