Misinterpretation of Symbolism and Metaphor: Many poems use symbolic language or metaphors to represent characters, emotions, or situations. LMs might struggle to decode these symbols accurately, leading to misidentification of protagonists and antagonists. For instance, in poems where abstract concepts like "Love" or "Death" are personified, LMs might incorrectly assign them protagonist or antagonist roles without understanding the underlying metaphorical context.

Difficulty in Understanding Personification and Anthropomorphism: Poems often attribute human qualities to non-human entities or abstract concepts. LMs might fail to understand these literary devices, leading to confusion about the roles and characteristics of the entities involved. For example, attributing literal actions to concepts like "time" or "nature" can lead to misinterpretations of their roles in the narrative.

Challenges with Ambiguous Narratives: Poetry frequently employs ambiguity, leaving certain elements open to multiple interpretations. LMs might struggle with this ambiguity, seeking to impose clear-cut roles on characters or concepts where the poet intentionally left them vague.

Complex Emotional Nuances: Poems often express intricate emotional landscapes, where a character could simultaneously embody conflicting roles (like a protagonist experiencing internal turmoil). LMs might find it challenging to navigate these nuances, leading to oversimplified character analysis.

Failure to Recognize Historical and Cultural Contexts: Some poems draw heavily on historical events, cultural backgrounds, or specific literary traditions. LMs might not have the depth of contextual understanding required to interpret these elements accurately, affecting their ability to discern character roles and relationships.

Misunderstanding of Poetic Tone and Voice: The tone of a poem (ironic, satirical, earnest, etc.) significantly influences the interpretation of its characters. LMs might not effectively detect and interpret these tones, leading to misreadings of the protagonist's and antagonist's intentions or natures.

Inadequate Grasp of Poetic Structure and Form: The structure of a poem (like sonnets, free verse, etc.) can provide clues about the narrative and character roles. LMs might not fully appreciate these structural elements, missing out on key interpretive cues.

Literal Interpretation of Figurative Language: Poems often use figurative language (like similes, metaphors, hyperbole). LMs might interpret these figuratively expressed ideas literally, misconstruing the roles and actions of characters or narrators.
