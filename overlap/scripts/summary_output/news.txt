Story: – Gwyneth Paltrow came clean in a magazine interview about the real reason for having just two kids, saying her third pregnancy ended in a miscarriage that nearly killed her, Sky News reports. "I had a really bad experience when I was pregnant with my third," she said. "It didn't work out and I nearly died. So I am like, 'Are we good here or should we go back and try again?'" But her children often ask for another sibling, and she feels "very broody" when she sees pal Beyonce Knowles with her "totally delish" one-year-old, Blue Ivy. The 40-year-old Oscar winner also oozed kudos for rocker-husband Chris Martin, saying he's a great dad to 8-year-old Apple and 6-year-old Moses. He "is so good to the children and to know that you had kids with such a good man is a real weight off you," she said. "We are committed co-parents, we make all the decisions together and lean on each other for support." Asked last year about having a third child, Paltrow said she was "past that" and "may have missed the window," reports the Daily Mail. "If it happens, it happens." (Read about her new cookbook, which one newspaper calls a "recipe for ridicule.")
Summary: Gwyneth Paltrow revealed in an interview that she had a miscarriage during her third pregnancy, which nearly killed her, and she is currently feeling "broody" and considering having another child despite previously saying she was "past that" and "may have missed the window."
Story: – The family of Walter Scott plans to file a federal civil rights lawsuit against the police department in North Charleston, South Carolina, reports the Post and Courier. The details of the wrongful death suit haven't been ironed out, however, including whether it will include a racial component. The New York Times, meanwhile, offers a look at how the Scott family first learned that someone had captured the shooting of Scott by officer Michael Slager on video. After a family vigil Sunday at the scene of his death, a man unknown to the family approached brother Anthony Scott and said, "I have something to share with you." They went into Scott's car, and the stranger—since identified as Feiden Santana—played the video on his phone. Santana was fearful about making it public, and the two struck what the Times calls a "gentleman's agreement"—if the police came clean about what happened the next day, they would keep the video private. "I had to hold my breath and let him go," recalls Scott. The police didn't do so, of course, and Santana kept his word and released the video. Also today, a black man who says that Slager used a Taser on him in 2013 for no reason also plans to file suit, reports the Guardian.
Summary: The Scott family plans to file a federal civil rights lawsuit against the North Charleston police department for the wrongful death of Walter Scott, with the possibility of including a racial component, after a stranger approached the family with video footage of the shooting.
Story: – Rand Paul wants the US to steer clear of Syria, but he says he's not planning any filibusters to make that happen, reports the Huffington Post. Paul today blamed reports to the contrary on a "misrepresentation from the media." Here's the quote from yesterday, via the Washington Post: “I can't imagine that we won't require 60 votes on this. Whether there’s an actual standing filibuster—I’ve got to check my shoes and check my ability to hold my water. And we will see. I haven’t made a decision on that.” After that, the New York Times quoted an aide saying that Paul would indeed filibuster. That has changed now, apparently. Slate has more on Paul's views: Essentially, he thinks that any US intervention would only make things worse—for the US, for Syrians, for Israel, for the entire region. "I think it's almost inevitable there'll be a second war if Assad falls," he says, adding that it might well result in "radical Islamists" taking over. Paul also tried to use President Obama's own words against him, notes Mediaite: In a proposed resolution, he quoted the then-senator warning the Bush camp not to strike Iran in 2007: “The President does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the nation.” Paul's resolution failed today.
Summary: Rand Paul has reversed his plan to filibuster a resolution on Syria, now believing that any US intervention would only make the situation worse for the US, Syrians, Israel, and the region, and fearing the possibility of radical Islamists taking over if Assad falls.
Story: – Jim Sanborn punched four messages into his curved copper sculpture, which has sat outside CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., since 1990. The first three messages of "Kryptos" were decoded by NSA cryptographers in 1993, then by fans in 1999. The 97-character fourth message, however, has stumped code breakers for 24 years, reports the New York Times. Sanborn, 69, threw fans a bone in 2010 when he revealed the 64th to 69th characters spell out "Berlin," but no one cracked the puzzle. Now, he's offering another clue: The next part of the sequence—characters 70 through 74, which read "MZFPK"—spells out "clock." When asked if his sculpture's message relates to the famed "Berlin clock," itself a puzzle that tells time using colored blocks of light, he tells the Times, "You'd better delve into that particular clock." But Wired points out his comments may only serve to throw fans off track. Instead, "clock" may refer to a method created to crack the Nazi's Enigma ciphers. Alan Turing built upon the method to eventually crack Enigma; Wired suggests it's perhaps "no coincidence" that The Imitation Game, a movie about Turing and Enigma, hits theaters in one week. Sanborn says the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall encouraged him to offer the hint. (Italian police recently cracked a Mafia code.)
Summary: The artist Jim Sanborn has provided a new clue to the 24-year-old puzzle inscribed on his "Kryptos" sculpture outside CIA headquarters, revealing that the sequence "MZFPK" spells out "clock," possibly referring to a method used to crack Nazi Enigma ciphers.
Story: – Marijuana is a Schedule I drug and it's going to stay that way, sources tell NPR and the Washington Post in advance of the Drug Enforcement Administration's announcement Thursday on the subject. Some five years ago, two Democratic governors petitioned the agency to rebrand the drug as one with accepted medical uses. The upshot, per DEA head Chuck Rosenberg, as quoted by NPR: "This decision is based on whether marijuana, as determined by the FDA, is a safe and effective medicine, and it's not." That's a reference to the FDA's current stance: It "has not approved marijuana as a safe and effective drug for any indication." This though half the country's states permit medical marijuana use in some capacity. What the DEA is expected to loosen up are its research rules. The University of Mississippi is the feds' sole pot grower, a distinction it has held since 1968. Going forward, there may be what NPR calls "new avenues" for producing pot for scientific research. Again, Rosenberg: "We want to expand the availability, the variety, the type of marijuana available to legitimate researchers. If our understanding of the science changes, that could very well drive a new decision." Reuters notes that outside of the petitioning process, the only other avenue to reclassification is through Congress. There are currently five drug schedules, with heroin and LSD joining marijuana in Schedule I. Had pot been moved to Schedule II alongside Vicodin, Adderall, and Ritalin, it would have been "subject to the standard prescription process," notes MarketWatch.
Summary: The DEA has announced that it will not reclassify marijuana as a safe and effective medicine, despite petitions from two Democratic governors and growing medical marijuana use in half of the US states, as the FDA has not approved it for any indication and the agency seeks to expand research opportunities for the drug.
Story: – Online privacy concerns are migrating to the real world. A researcher at Carnegie Mellon was able to identify 31% of students passing by with the help of facial recognition software, reports Mashable. First he collected 25,000 photos from Facebook profiles. Then he asked passersby to pose for a quick webcam photo. He had names for 1 in 3 in a matter of seconds. In just a few years, “facial visual searches may become as common as today's text-based searches,” says researcher Alessandro Acquisti. His team also made an iPhone app that takes pictures of people and reveals their names and personal data. Another test compared Facebook data with dating site information and was able to identify about 10% of those on the dating site, even though they were using pseudonyms, CNET reports. It all means “ominous risks for privacy,” says Acquisti. After all, it's easy to change your name online, but not your face.
Summary: A researcher at Carnegie Mellon was able to identify 31% of students using facial recognition software, with the help of 25,000 Facebook photos, and predicts that "facial visual searches may become as common as today's text-based searches" posing ominous risks for privacy as it is easy to change online identities but not one's face.
Story: – Police in San Diego say a couple whose 3-day-old baby was mauled to death by the family dog made two unsuccessful 911 calls before getting frustrated and driving the boy to the hospital themselves, the AP reports. Police Lt. Scott Wahl told KNSD-TV Saturday that the parents waited 28 seconds before hanging up their first call, then tried again and waited 34 seconds before giving up. Police say the couple was in bed with the baby Thursday night when the dog was startled and attacked the baby; the child was declared dead at the hospital. Cops say the family has their condolences and that they, too, are frustrated by slow 911 response times. They say their operators are understaffed and that 73 calls came in during the half-hour span when the parents called. The dog, a 2-year-old Great Dane-terrier mix named Polo who had no past reports of aggressiveness, was taken by the San Diego Department of Animal Services for a 10-day quarantine to ensure it's not rabid, KFMB reports. Polo will be put down after that time if the baby's parents don't come to take him back, per a DAS rep. (A 9-year-old was killed by his sister's pit bulls.)
Summary: A couple in San Diego made two unsuccessful 911 calls before driving their 3-day-old baby to the hospital themselves after the baby was mauled to death by their family dog, with police expressing frustration over slow 911 response times and the dog being taken for a 10-day quarantine.
Story: – The Colorado floods have now killed eight people, and at least 648 more are still unaccounted for, NBC News reports. The latest death was an 83-year-old man who was swept three miles downstream when the ground collapsed underneath him in the town of Idaho Springs yesterday afternoon, the Denver Post reports. One pocket of good news: Yesterday's improved weather allowed for more rescues, with helicopters evacuating at least 250 people from areas in Larimer County that had been cut off by the flood, the Post reports. And the National Weather Service is forecasting no more rain this week, the Wall Street Journal reports. "The worst is over," says an National Weather Service employee. With at least 1,500 homes destroyed and nearly 18,000 more damaged—numbers which are expected to rise—this bit of news is particularly distressing: USA Today reports that only 22,000 homes and businesses have flood insurance, according to FEMA, meaning thousands of homeowners lack coverage. One expert estimates that just 10% to 25% of people in areas at high risk of flood are covered. Colorado's richest oil field is currently underwater, and thousands of wells and operating sites have been hit by the floods, leading to concerns about environmental contamination. "The scale is unprecedented," the executive director of the state's Department of Natural Resources tells the Denver Post. Adds a former BP chemist, "To have something this inland, this level of flooding in an area with high oil and gas development, it's new territory."
Summary: At least 8 people have died and 648 are still unaccounted for due to the Colorado floods, with 1,500 homes destroyed and 18,000 more damaged, while only 22,000 homes and businesses have flood insurance, leading to concerns about environmental contamination in the state's richest oil field.
Story: – Ousted Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovich is now officially a fugitive from justice, just two days after the country's parliament voted to remove him from office. The country's interim interior minister has issued an arrest warrant accusing the ex-leader of "mass murder of peaceful citizens" over the deaths of scores of protesters in Kiev last week, the BBC reports. Yanukovich, who fled the capital over the weekend while still declaring himself the country's legitimate leader, seems highly unlikely to turn himself in. Officials say he was last seen in the autonomous and strongly pro-Russia Crimea region, but left by car for an unknown destination. The Obama administration has warned Russia against sending troops to Ukraine, which is split between a pro-Russia east and pro-European Union west, Voice of America reports. Russian intervention would be a "grave mistake," National Security Adviser Susan Rice warned yesterday. "It is not in the interest of Ukraine or of Russia, or Europe, or the United States to see the country split. It is in nobody’s interest to see violence return and the situation escalate." But Dmitry Medvedev said he had "great doubts" about the legitimacy of the new government. "Some of our foreign, Western partners think otherwise," he told Russian media, according to the AFP. "This is some kind of aberration of perception when people call legitimate what is essentially the result of an armed mutiny." The Kremlin has recalled its ambassador to Kiev, and there have been pro-Yanukovich demonstrations in Russia. But fears of a split are easing, the New York Times finds. Yanukovich's own party has now turned against him, issuing a statement accusing him of betraying a country that now finds itself "deceived and robbed." Parliament speaker and acting president Oleksandr Turchinov—an ally of now-freed Yanukovich archrival Yulia Tymoshenko is expected to form a unity government before tomorrow to run the country until elections in May. But whoever takes charge will face very tough challenges, including an economy in crisis, Reuters notes. To ease the transition, the EU and US have both offered financial aid.
Summary: Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych has been declared a fugitive from justice and an arrest warrant has been issued for him on charges of "mass murder of peaceful citizens" following the deaths of scores of protesters in Kiev, while the international community, including the US and EU, have warned Russia against intervening in Ukraine's crisis and offered financial aid to help the country transition to a new government.
Story: – Janet Jackson called police on Saturday night for a welfare check on her son while the 17-month-old was with his father, the local sheriff's office has confirmed. Jackson's brother Randy tells ET that Jackson was concerned after a nanny who was helping Jackson's estranged husband, Wissam Al Mana, with the couple's son, Eissa Al Mana, got in touch with Jackson to say she was so scared by aggressive behavior from Wissam Al Mana that she had locked herself in a bathroom. Law enforcement sources tell TMZ Jackson was afraid Al Mana might have been using drugs. Police responded to the Nobu Hotel in Malibu, Calif., where Al Mana had the child. "They decided the child was OK and they left," a spokesperson for the sheriff's station tells People. Authorities further tell the Blast that there was no sign of drugs, and that the office was "confused as to why Jackson made the allegation." No report was taken and authorities told Al Mana and Jackson (who was not at the scene) to handle things civilly. Jackson and Al Mana, who wed in 2012, split up in April 2017 just three months after Eissa was born. Since then, there have been rumors and reports of controlling behavior and verbal abuse, as well as one odd love letter. Us notes that Jackson has been fighting Al Mana for sole custody of Eissa.
Summary: Janet Jackson called the police on her estranged husband, Wissam Al Mana, after a nanny who was helping him with their 17-month-old son reported being scared of his aggressive behavior and locked herself in a bathroom, with Jackson fearing he might be using drugs, but authorities found no signs of drugs and no report was taken.
Story: – The AV Club counted down the top 50 movies of the 1990s this week, with Goodfellas coming out on top. It doesn't just hold up after more than a decade, it keeps getting better. "Every return trip also reveals how much is at work in Martin Scorsese's decades-spanning mob drama, which doubles as a history of the mafia’s rise and fall as well as an exploration of what it takes to make it in America." The top five: Goodfellas (1990): "Breathtaking." Pulp Fiction (1994): Quentin Tarantino's film "changed everything" and spawned countless imitators. Toy Story 2 (1999): "A rare case of a sequel improving on the original." Dazed And Confused (1993): Richard Linklater's film offers way more than just '70s nostalgia. Chungking Express (1994): Nothing rivals it in terms of "sheer sensuality." Read the full top 10 here, and get the rest of the top 50 in two takes here and here.
Summary: Goodfellas, directed by Martin Scorsese, topped The AV Club's countdown of the top 50 movies of the 1990s, with the film continuing to improve with each viewing and offering a comprehensive exploration of the mafia's rise and fall in America.
Story: – An ambitious new study by some of the world's top virus experts estimates that at least 320,000 still-unidentified viruses are lurking out there among mammals—some presumably with the potential to jump from animals to humans, reports Smithsonian. That's the scary-sounding part. The better part is that the number is much lower than expected, and researchers in the journal mBio write that scientists could probably identify 85% of them with an investment of $1.4 billion. The remaining 15% would cost an additional $5 billion or so, and the researchers argue that the money would be a wise investment, reports PhysOrg. "By contrast, the economic impact of the SARS pandemic is calculated to be $16 billion," writes one of the researchers. "If we know what's out there, we'll be a lot better prepared when a virus jumps over into a human population." So how did they get the 320,000 figure? The researchers zeroed in on one species—a bat in Bangladesh known as the flying fox, reports the BBC. They took 1,900 samples from trapped bats (all of whom were later released) and discovered that they harbored about 60 viruses, only five of which were previously known to science. From there, they extrapolated to all mammals. Further studies are underway to fine-tune the estimate.
Summary: According to a new study by top virus experts, an estimated 320,000 still-unidentified viruses are thought to be lurking among mammals, with the potential to jump to humans, but researchers argue that identifying these viruses could be a wise investment to prepare for future pandemics, with an estimated cost of $1.4 billion for 85% of them and $5 billion for the remaining 15%.
Story: – President Trump is serious about a plan to put solar panels on his proposed border wall. There's "a very good chance" panels will be included in the final design and "we have major companies looking at that," Trump told reporters as he flew to France on Wednesday. Business Insider calls it his most detailed public remarks on the wall in months. But there's an added caveat: The wall must be see-through or "have openings because you have to see what's on the other side." Without openings, people on the US side won't see when "they throw the large sacks of drugs over … They hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? It's over," Trump said. Business Insider reports Trump's example isn't an outlandish one, as "cannons" that could potentially launch drugs have been found at the border. Trump has suggested solar panels would offset the cost of the wall, though the Washington Post notes most electricity generated "would be useless" without costly transmission lines to direct it to more populated parts of the US. Trump also said that while the border measures 2,000 miles, only 700 to 900 miles of wall are needed. Mountains and rivers provide natural barriers, and 600 miles of fencing are already in place and currently undergoing repairs, the Hill reports. Trump suggested Wednesday that the repairs meant he was making good on his promise for a border wall. "We're taking wall that was good but it's in very bad shape, and we're making it new. We're fixing it … so in a true sense, we've already started the wall." The New York Times has Trump's comments in full; he plans to invite Vladimir Putin to the White House "at the right time."
Summary: President Trump is considering incorporating solar panels into his proposed border wall to offset the cost, but the electricity generated would be useless without transmission lines to direct it to more populated areas of the US.
Story: – An assailant shot and killed a Sacramento County sheriff's deputy and wounded two other deputies and a bystander today during a series of shootings that spanned more than 30 miles through two California counties. After a search in the Sierra Nevada foothills this afternoon, a suspect has been taken into custody; he has been identified as Marcelo Marquez, 34, the Sacramento Bee reports. Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones says deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was killed after he approached a suspicious vehicle in a motel parking lot this morning and was shot in the forehead at close range. A Placer County Sheriff's spokeswoman says two deputies from her department also were shot in Auburn, about 30 miles north of Sacramento, as the manhunt continued. The conditions of the other two deputies and the bystander were not immediately known. A woman who was with the man was earlier taken into custody; authorities say she had a handgun in her purse. During the search for the suspect, residents in the rural area were urged to stay indoors and schools were on lockdown; one high school was evacuated.
Summary: An assailant shot and killed a Sacramento County sheriff's deputy and wounded two other deputies and a bystander in a series of shootings that spanned over 30 miles in two California counties, with the suspect, Marcelo Marquez, 34, taken into custody after a search in the Sierra Nevada foothills.
Story: – Don't expect terror attacks to end with the Islamic State's defeat in Iraq and Syria. Though that defeat is on the horizon, "through the fingers of that crush are going to come hundreds of really dangerous people and they are going to flow primarily to Western Europe" and possibly into the US, FBI chief James Comey says, per the New York Times. It will be "a terrorist diaspora out of Syria like we've never seen before," he adds, per Bloomberg. "A lot of terrorists fled out of Afghanistan in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This is 10 times that or more." John Kerry announced last week that ISIS has been driven from almost 50% of its territory in Iraq and 20% of its territory in Syria. But "not all of the Islamic State killers are going to die on the battlefield," says Comey, speaking from the International Conference on Cyber Security in New York. Future attacks inspired or carried out by ISIS—especially lone-wolf attacks that are "increasingly hard" to stop—are "the greatest threat to the physical safety of Americans today" and will be "an order of magnitude greater than anything we've seen before." Europe has gotten a look at that reality with the attacks in Brussels and Paris, he adds. But as for the US, "that challenge is going to come."
Summary: The defeat of ISIS in Iraq and Syria is unlikely to end terrorist attacks in the West, as hundreds of dangerous terrorists are expected to flow into Western Europe and possibly the US, according to FBI Chief James Comey.
Story: – Some of the biggest names in US soccer are rallying around a little girl who was disqualified from her local soccer club's tournament this weekend. Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm have both publicly supported 8-year-old Mili Hernandez after her story went viral, the AP reports. Hernandez plays for the Azzuri-Cachorros Chicas in Omaha, Neb., and her team was disqualified Sunday after playing in the earlier part of the Springfield Soccer Association girls' tournament—because, her family claims to WOWT, organizers thought Hernandez, whose hair is short, was a boy. The family says they went so far as to show Hernandez's insurance card, with her gender listed, to organizers, but they wouldn't budge. "Mili, don't EVER let anyone tell you that you aren't perfect just as you are.i won championships with short hair," Wambach wrote on Twitter Monday. Hamm weighed in with her own tweet the same day: "Hey Mili, we would love to host you at one of our camps @TeamFirstSA . Be you!" Organizers later told WOWT that Hernandez's hair wasn't the issue; rather, they say, she was accidentally listed as a boy on the team roster. That didn't change Wambach's support for the girl: She posted on Instagram late Monday night that Hernandez is "my new hero. Her team was disqualified from a tourney cause they thought she was a boy because of a clerical error that wasn't handled properly. Let's meet soon sister."
Summary: Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm have publicly supported 8-year-old Mili Hernandez after she was disqualified from a soccer tournament due to a clerical error where organizers mistakenly listed her as a boy on the team roster, despite her short hair and insurance card with her gender listed as female.
Story: – Police departments don't usually weigh in on tech accessories, unless they happen to be dead ringers for handguns. The NYPD and other departments have been issuing public warnings in recent weeks about iPhone cases designed to look like weapons, reports CNNMoney and the New York Times. “This cell phone case is a terrible idea,” says the New Jersey State Police in a Facebook post. “Officers do not have the luxury of time when making split-second decisions while interacting with the public.” Today, Sen. Chuck Schumer joined in with a warning to Amazon, eBay, and other online merchants to stop selling the cases, notes the Times. Schumer says federal law requires fake guns to have an orange mark on their barrel to identify them as such, and the cases don't comply. As a result, he plans to work with US customs officials to try to block them from being imported into the country.
Summary: Police departments are warning the public about iPhone cases designed to resemble handguns, with the NYPD and other departments issuing warnings and Sen. Chuck Schumer calling for online merchants to stop selling the cases due to non-compliance with federal law requiring orange markings to identify fake guns.
Story: – Morrissey managed to convince the Staples Center to go meat-free, an achievement even Paul McCartney couldn't accomplish. At Morrissey's sold-out March 1 concert, the LA venue will only offer vegetarian food, for the first time ever. That means all the McDonald's outlets there will be closed, Billboard reports. McCartney had made the same request, but got turned down. "I don't look upon it as a victory for me, but a victory for the animals," Morrissey says in a statement. A portion of the proceeds will benefit PETA ... if the concert happens at all. Rolling Stone points out that Morrissey has canceled a few shows recently due to health concerns including a bleeding ulcer, but he's set to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live a week from today and resume touring the following day.
Summary: Morrissey convinced the Staples Center to go meat-free for his sold-out March concert, marking the first time the LA venue has offered vegetarian food, with all McDonald's outlets nearby closed, and a portion of the proceeds benefiting PETA.
Story: – On Wednesday, 15-year-old Jordan Lewis watched a video about bullying at his Illinois high school. That evening, police made a "wellness visit" to his home after the grandmother of a friend reported that he had texted her granddaughter about harming himself. On Thursday, Jordan fatally shot himself in the chest. His father says Jordan left behind a suicide note listing the reason why he took his life: "because he was being bullied," Brad Lewis tells the Southern. Though the sophomore played football at Carterville High School as a freshman, he quit after just a single day of practice this year, says Lewis, having told his dad he had been pushed into lockers by his classmates and was "being picked on." Lewis says he told his son stories about the bullying he weathered (for his red hair and glasses), and pushed him to tell school officials. The school said it got no such reports. Lewis thinks the video could have actually given his son a nudge, telling the Los Angeles Times that "at the end ... the kid that was being bullied went home and killed himself." Just hours after his son's death, the 47-year-old posted a video to Facebook speaking out about bullying, saying it "has to stop"; it's been shared more than 2,000 times. The Williamson County Sheriff’s Office says it is investigating. (It's not the only wrenching story to make headlines of late: A dad on a cross-country trek to honor his 15-year-old son who also committed suicide was killed in Colorado this month.)
Summary: A 15-year-old boy in Illinois named Jordan Lewis died by suicide after being bullied at his high school, with his father believing that a video he watched about bullying may have triggered the act.
Story: – The government is releasing a once-classified chapter of a congressional report about the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, that questions whether Saudi nationals who were in contact with the hijackers after they arrived in the US knew what they were planning. Later investigations found no evidence that the Saudi government or senior Saudi officials knowingly supported those who orchestrated the attacks. But lawmakers and relatives of victims, who don't believe all Saudi links to the attackers were thoroughly investigated, pushed for more than 13 years to get the pages released. Former President George W. Bush classified the chapter to protect intelligence sources and methods and perhaps to avoid upsetting Saudi Arabia, a close US ally. President Barack Obama ordered a declassification review of the chapter, which Congress released on Friday, the AP reports. CNN clarifies that "the 28 pages," as the chapter has long been known, is actually 29 pages long. Read it here.
Summary: The US government has released a previously classified chapter of a congressional report on the 9/11 attacks that questions whether Saudi nationals in contact with the hijackers after their arrival in the US knew of their plans, despite later investigations finding no evidence of Saudi government support for the attacks.
Story: – Ariana Grande has had enough. Blamed by some Instagram followers for ex-boyfriend Mac Miller's death on Friday, the 25-year-old disabled comments on her social media feed, reports People. Commenters hurled lowballs like "You lowkey evil," "Damn u killed the homie," and "I HOPE YOURE [sic] HAPPY WITH PETE [Davidson]," according to a tweet from Pop Crave. Grande has kept mum about the rapper's death, posting only a quick video of her UK hotel room with the words, "Bye London." The "No Tears Left to Cry" singer has been down this road before, when Miller was arrested in May for a DUI following his breakup with Grande. Naturally, some blamed her for his behavior. "I am not a babysitter or a mother and no woman should feel that they need to be," she wrote on Twitter at the time. "I have cared for him and tried to support his sobriety and prayed for his balance for years (and always will of course) but shaming/blaming women for a man's inability to keep his s— together is a very major problem." Miller blamed himself for the DUI, per People, but that didn't stop some from criticizing Grande this time around. Now it seems the Twitterverse is on her side: "I hope Ariana has a strong support systems [sic] because the locals are intent on blaming her for something she has no business being blamed for ... AGAIN," reads a sample tweet. "Wishing you nothing but peace and strength." Miller died of a suspected drug overdose.
Summary: Ariana Grande has faced criticism on social media after ex-boyfriend Mac Miller's death, with some blaming her for his overdose despite her previous statements about not being a "babysitter or mother" and offering support for his sobriety.
Story: – Prince's body has been cremated, and "a private, beautiful ceremony" has been held in Minneapolis for his nearest and dearest, his publicist confirmed Saturday in a statement, and "final storage" of his remains will be kept private. A "musical celebration" will be held eventually, notes the Los Angeles Times. "We ask for your blessings and prayers of comfort for his family and close friends at this time," the statement said. An autopsy was conducted Friday, but results aren't expected for weeks yet. Meanwhile, Saturday Night Live paid tribute to the icon in its Saturday show, called "Good Night, Sweet Prince," reports the AP. Jimmy Fallon returned to host.
Summary: Prince's body has been cremated in a private ceremony, with a musical celebration planned for the future, and his closest friends and family are asking for blessings and prayers for comfort.
Story: – Saudi Arabia says it rejects any "threats" of economic sanctions or political pressure regarding the disappearance of a Saudi writer—and European nations are calling for an investigation, the AP reports. In a statement carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency on Sunday, the Saudi government said it will respond to any steps taken against it over the vanishing of Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi stocks plunged nearly 7% Sunday after President Trump went on 60 Minutes and said that "we're going to get to the bottom of it, and there will be severe punishment" if US officials find that Riyadh ordered Khashoggi's murder. Khashoggi went missing when he visited the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials fear Khashoggi was killed and dismembered, allegations rejected by Saudi officials. Meanwhile, Germany, France, and Britain are calling for a "credible investigation" to establish what happened to Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi and seek a "complete and detailed" Saudi response. The German, French, and British foreign ministers said in a joint statement Sunday that defending freedom of expression and ensuring protection for journalists are key priorities and that they are "treating this incident with the utmost seriousness." They said there must be a credible investigation to establish the truth and "if relevant" identify those responsible for Khashoggi's disappearance. "We encourage joint Saudi-Turkish efforts in that regard, and expect the Saudi government to provide a complete and detailed response," they added.
Summary: Saudi Arabia has rejected any economic sanctions or political pressure regarding the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, while European nations are calling for an investigation and demanding a complete and detailed response from the Saudi government.
Story: – Meet Razanandrongobe sakalavae, the giant dinosaur-killing crocodile that roamed what is now Madagascar 165 million years ago. Razana, as it's known for short, was first discovered a decade ago, but due to limited fossilized remains, little was known about the creature until recently. Thanks to research published Tuesday in PeerJ, we now have a picture of—as Gizmodo describes it—"an enormous, land-striding relative of crocodiles with a nightmare where its face ought to go." Razana is believed to have been 23 feet long and weighed up to 2,200 pounds, CNN reports. Its head was the size of a washing machine, and its serrated teeth were the size of bananas. According to a press release, its teeth, which rival those of Tyrannosaurus rex, could likely crush bone and tendon. Razana is further evidence that dinosaurs weren't quite the untouchable rulers of their world as once believed. Researchers, who describe Razana as a "one-ton, terrifying bone crusher," say it would have been at the top of the food chain in prehistoric Madagascar and eaten dinosaurs. While Razana has the front-facing nostrils, bony palate, and teeth sockets of modern crocodiles and alligators, it differs from its descendants in some pretty startling ways. For one, it was more suited to life on land, as evidenced by the positioning and shape of its legs, which gave Razana the ability to sprint after prey. (Tyrannosaurus rex had a bite so powerful it's hard to fathom.)
Summary: A giant crocodile-like creature called Razanandrongobe sakalavae, or Razana, lived in Madagascar 165 million years ago and was estimated to be 23 feet long and weigh up to 2,200 pounds, with a head the size of a washing machine and serrated teeth the size of bananas, and was believed to be at the top of the food chain in prehistoric Madagascar and would have eaten dinosaurs, differing from its modern crocodile and alligator descendants in its ability to sprint on land.
Story: – For more than five years, a killer has been on the loose in California. No longer, say police. Authorities in Los Angeles say they've arrested a man believed to have raped and killed two women, then dumped their bodies near freeways in 2011, reports the Los Angeles Times. Michelle Lozano, 17, disappeared on Easter of that year before her naked body was found stuffed in a plastic container off a freeway. She had been raped and strangled, reports the Times. Then a day after Christmas, 22-year-old Bree'Anna Guzman—who lived less than a mile away from Lozano in Lincoln Heights—left family members to go to a drugstore and never returned. Her body turned up a month later off a freeway. She had died of blunt force trauma to the head. In 2014, police announced the killings were related, but the biggest break in the case came Thursday, when authorities said they'd arrested Geovanni Borjas, 32, per FOX 11. Police say a search of a statewide DNA database showed Borjas' father was a relative of the killer. Officers soon eyed Borjas—who has a domestic violence restraining order against him—and collected his DNA when he spit on a sidewalk. Police say the sample was an exact match to DNA collected in both the case of Lozano, who was acquainted with Borjas, and Guzman, who visited a medical clinic where he worked. At a hearing Tuesday, Borjas pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder, two counts of rape, and one count of kidnapping. He is being held without bail. (Familial DNA solved this murder.)
Summary: A 32-year-old man, Geovanni Borjas, was arrested and charged with the murders of two women in California, whose bodies were found dumped near freeways in 2011, after a DNA sample collected from a sidewalk match the DNA found at the crime scenes, with the help of a statewide DNA database and a domestic violence restraining order against him.
Story: – A 5-year-old Canadian girl missing following her mother's murder is believed dead. The Calgary Herald reports authorities found a body believed to be that of Taliyah Marsman in a rural field on Thursday. Police believe she was dead before an Amber Alert for her went out early Tuesday. Her mother, 34-year-old Sara Baillie, was found dead in their home late Monday. People reports 46-year-old Edward Downey has been charged with murdering Baillie and Taliyah. Police say Downey, who also goes by Edward Simmons, was a family friend who had an "extensive criminal history." He was apprehended Wednesday. Police still don't know why Baillie and Taliyah were killed.
Summary: A 5-year-old Canadian girl, Taliyah Marsman, who was missing after her mother's murder, was found dead in a rural field, with the suspect, a family friend with an extensive criminal history, arrested and charged with the murders.
Story: – A Mississippi campus is on lockdown after a shooting this morning left one professor dead and a shooter on the loose, the Clarion-Ledger reports. "Delta State University has confirmed one fatality. Campus remains under lockdown. Please stay inside and away from windows," reads a tweet posted shortly after noon EDT on the college's Twitter page, which has been adding updates as police converged. Little information has been released so far on the shooting, with the shooter said to have been spotted initially near Jobe Hall, the paper notes. The Bolivar County Deputy Coroner says the professor was a male in his mid-50s who was killed in an office in Jobe Hall, per the AP. The university hasn't confirmed the victim's ID, but a spokeswoman says it's still an "active situation." An English professor sent a Facebook message to the AP saying, "Fortunately for us, our public safety officers and university officials have trained many of us for active shooter situations. Many students are locked-down in classrooms, and professors and staff members are telling them the protocol. Plus, we are all texting and Facebooking each other to make sure we are safe." The Cleveland Police Department tells the Clarion-Ledger it's coordinating with campus police, and the school's Twitter page indicates the Bolivar County Sheriff's Office is also helping out. An additional tweet notes an emergency command center has been set up and the governor's office and the state's Institutions of Higher Learning have offered their assistance.
Summary: A shooting at Delta State University in Mississippi left one professor dead and the campus in lockdown, with the shooter still at large, and authorities have confirmed the victim's identity as a male in his mid-50s.
Story: – Yesterday came the news that German tax inspectors investigating an elderly loner in 2011 uncovered a stash of Nazi-looted art believed to be worth $1.35 billion. Today come the details: The BBC reports the total haul recovered from Cornelius Gurlitt's Munich apartment was 1,258 unframed works and 121 framed ones, and they're in fairly extraordinary condition, with no damage beyond a layer of dirt. In that group are a number of works that were previously unknown, by greats such as Henri Matisse and Marc Chagall. But that's not the only thing that's unknown. The head of the Augsburg state prosecutor's office says they don't know where the 80-year-old is right now, and, further, "We don't have any strong suspicion of a crime that would justify an arrest." Bloomberg reports that Gurlitt made only infrequent visits to the apartment, which the New York Times reports was targeted following an exchange between Gurlitt and customs officials in September 2010. They found him holding $12,150 in €500 notes while on a train arriving from Switzerland, which they found suspicious. The Guardian reports that Gurlitt was present when authorities descended on his flat in the spring of 2011, but that neighbors haven't seen him since August. (Click for more on the squalid apartment where the works were stored.)
Summary: German tax inspectors uncovered a stash of Nazi-looted art worth $1.35 billion in an elderly man's apartment in Munich, including 1,258 unframed and 121 framed works by artists such as Henri Matisse and Marc Chagall, with some pieces previously unknown, but the owner, Cornelius Gurlitt, is currently unaccounted for and there is no strong suspicion of a crime to justify an arrest.
Story: – In what Reuters is calling the "worst outbreak of violence along the Gaza frontier since an eight-day war in 2012," the Israeli military today struck at least 50 sites in the Gaza Strip by air and sea—and mobilized 1,500 reservists for a potential ground invasion, though the military said such an invasion was not imminent. Still, an Israeli army rep emphasized, "indeed we are preparing." To that end, the Israeli government today gave the military the OK to mobilize as many as 40,000 additional reservists. The military says it has no immediate plans to actually do so, but described the order as a contingency if "Operation Protective Edge" needs to be expanded, reports the AP. Israel says the operation could become a long-term one against Hamas and is aimed at stopping a recent barrage of rocket attacks against Israel. Per the military, more than 200 rockets have been launched from the Gaza Strip since it arrested hundreds in the search for three missing teens who were later found dead. Among the 50 locations the Israeli army said it targeted today were four houses it described as "activity sites" belonging to Hamas militants, reports the AP. The armed wing of Hamas threatened an "earthquake" in response to the Israeli strikes and said it would broaden the range of its rocket targets, and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas directed Israel to "immediately stop its escalation and the raids on Gaza," reports the BBC.
Summary: The Israeli military launched airstrikes and sea attacks on at least 50 sites in the Gaza Strip, mobilized 1,500 reservists for a potential ground invasion, and received permission to mobilize up to 40,000 additional reservists in response to a recent barrage of rocket attacks from Gaza, with Hamas vowing to retaliate and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas calling for an end to the escalation.
Story: – Jerry Brown entered the race for California governor today, vowing to use his experience as a former two-term governor to "get California working again." Brown, a Democrat and current attorney general, used the unpopularity of Arnold Schwarzenegger to criticize Republican candidate Meg Whitman. Like Schwarzenegger before her, the former eBay CEO is running as an outsider to politics, notes the Los Angeles Times. "Our state is in serious trouble and the next governor must have preparation, and knowledge," Brown, 71, said in a video announcing his candidacy. "That's what I offer. Some people say that if you've been around the process, you can't handle the job, that we need to go out and find an outsider who knows virtually nothing about state government. Well we tried that, and it doesn't work. We found out that not knowing is not good." Check out the video on his official website.
Summary: Jerry Brown, a former two-term governor of California and current attorney general, is running for governor again, vowing to use his experience to "get California working again" and criticizing his Republican opponent Meg Whitman's lack of political experience.
Story: – Her husband didn't dwell much on his African heritage when he addressed a group of young leaders from the continent this week in DC, but first lady Michelle Obama took the opposite approach today, reports Reuters. “The blood of Africa runs through my veins, and I care deeply,” she told 500 Africans completing a six-week fellowship in Washington. “The roots of my family tree are in Africa,” she said to cheers, noting that the president's father was born in Kenya. The first lady urged the group to focus on women's equality upon returning home, reports AP. Making sure girls get an education is important, but it's not enough, she said. Men must “look into their hearts and souls and ask if they truly view women as their equals." The first lady said the men who raised her set great examples on that front, "which is why I went on to marry a man who had the good sense to fall in love with a woman who was his equal, to treat me as such—a man who supports and reveres me."
Summary: First Lady Michelle Obama emphasized the importance of women's equality in Africa, noting that her family's roots are in the continent and that her husband's father was born in Kenya, while urging the young leaders to prioritize this issue upon returning home.
Story: – President Obama will make an unconventional Cabinet pick today, naming REI Equipment Inc. CEO Sally Jewell as his new secretary of the Interior, a source tells the Washington Post. Jewell has had an interesting career path: She started out as an engineer for Mobil Oil, then became a commercial banker, before finally landing her spot at REI. She has little policy experience, though she has occasionally dipped her toe into politics, introducing Obama at the White House's 2011 Great Outdoors Initiative and taking part in Obama's 2009 CEO health care summit. But Jewell isn't a partisan Democrat; she made a high-profile appearance in support of John McCain in 2008. The pick is also unusual, the Post points out, because the Interior secretary position is often reserved for a Western politician. But Jewell would give Obama another woman in his Cabinet, countering critics who complained that his early second-term nominees were all men.
Summary: President Obama will nominate Sally Jewell, CEO of REI Equipment Inc., as Secretary of the Interior, despite her lack of policy experience and unusual career path, which includes engineering for Mobil Oil, commercial banking, and occasional political involvement.
Story: – A briefing about Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 became a hostage crisis yesterday when Chinese family members refused to let airline workers leave a Beijing hotel, NBC News reports. About 200 relatives of missing jet passengers took 10 workers hostage for nearly 11 hours at the Lido Hotel, expressing their "dissatisfaction" over what they heard, according to a statement from the airline. Reports differ on what angered them: A Kuala Lumpur-based website, Malaysian Digest, says they lost it when told that debris washed up on an Australian shore was not from flight 370. According to Australia's News Network, they grew heated when a Malaysian official didn't attend the briefing. Either way, airline officials were kept at the hotel while dozens of family members went to the Malaysian embassy and protested. The hostages went free just before 2am, and the only damage was a kick to the knee received by Malaysian Airlines' security supervisor. Chinese families have been complaining bitterly for weeks about the airline's handling of the search, which they call incompetent and secretive. In an odd development, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak told CNN yesterday that he just learned about a plane picked up by his country's radar on the night flight 370 disappeared. It "behaved like a commercial airline," he said, so no military planes went up to investigate.
Summary: Chinese family members of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 passengers took 10 airline workers hostage at a Beijing hotel for nearly 11 hours, expressing their dissatisfaction over the airline's handling of the search and the conflicting information they received during a briefing.

Story: – The UK remains in disarray after last week's Brexit vote, with the pound continuing to slump, chaos at the top of both main political parties, and widespread confusion over what leaving the European Union is going to involve. Top figures in the ruling Conservative Party have been jockeying for position since Prime Minister David Cameron announced his resignation Friday, but the opposition Labour Party is in no position to take advantage, the New York Times reports. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is facing rebellion from party members who fear his leftist policies will doom the party to defeat in a possible election this year. At least 10 members of Corbyn's shadow cabinet resigned after he fired shadow foreign secretary Hillary Benn in an attempt to stop a leadership coup. In other developments: The leaders of Germany, France, and Italy are meeting in Berlin today and the speed of Britain's departure is expected to be the main focus of talks, the BBC reports. France and Germany say they are in "full agreement," though it isn't clear exactly what the position they agree on is. Boris Johnson, a key Brexit supporter who is seeking to replace Cameron as prime minister, toned down his position so much in his weekly Telegraph column that it almost seemed like a U-turn. He said Britain will continue to increase cooperation with the EU in many areas, any changes will come slowly, and Brexit supporters need to accept that a 52% to 48% victory is "not entirely overwhelming," the Guardian reports. In early trading, indexes in Britain, France, and Germany all fell, with banking stocks particularly hard hit. "The extent of the uncertainty that now clouds the UK's economic and political outlook is hard to exaggerate," Kit Juckes, strategist at Societe Generale, tells CNN. The Washington Post spoke to voters in Tilbury, a fading port town in southeast England that heavily backed Brexit, and finds that many of them are already regretting the vote, feeling that they were lied to by politicians in the Leave campaign. Reuters reports that since Cameron says he won't personally trigger Article 50 to leave the EU, it is far from clear when the British exit will actually happen. Some officials now say a vote in Parliament will have to happen first, though EU foreign ministers now want the exit to happen quickly. (Scotland's First Minister says she is prepared to block Brexit to protect Scottish interests.)
Summary: The UK is in disarray after the Brexit vote, with the pound slumping, political chaos, and confusion over the implications of leaving the EU, while top figures jockey for position and opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn faces rebellion from party members.
Story: – Israel denied entry to Noam Chomsky yesterday, blocking the renowned academic from a speaking engagement at the West Bank's Birzeit University. Chomsky believes he was denied entry because the government "did not like that I was only talking at Birzeit and not at an Israeli university, too," he told the BBC. Israeli officials chalk the incident up to a misunderstanding between the military and civilian government, and say they are trying to reverse the decision. Chomsky, though, isn't buying it: "There was no misunderstanding. I was invited to give a series of lectures," he told the Guardian. "It was straightforward, I do it all the time." And to Haaretz, he added, "I find it hard to think of a similar case, in which entry to a person is denied because he is not lecturing in Tel Aviv. Perhaps only in Stalinist regimes." The linguist added that he would now not have time to visit Birzeit, even if he was immediately cleared for entry.
Summary: Israel denied entry to Noam Chomsky at the last minute, citing a "misunderstanding" between military and civilian government officials, despite his invitation to speak at Birzeit University, with Chomsky himself attributing the denial to a desire to limit his speaking engagement to a single Palestinian university rather than multiple Israeli institutions.
Story: – Fox News has issued an apology after airing an interview with a US veteran who, it turns out, was not the hero he claimed to be. Introduced on the network Oct. 8 as a former Navy SEAL who served in Vietnam and earned 22 commendations and two Purple Hearts, John Garofalo has since admitted to the Military Times that he greatly exaggerated his military credentials. Garofalo is indeed a Navy veteran and a glass artist who hopes to gift President Trump with a 4-foot presidential glass seal, the focus of the Fox segment. But he was never a SEAL, he never served in Vietnam, and he didn't earn all those commendations, not even a single Purple Heart. Instead, he did a short overseas tour in Spain during four years of Navy service ending in 1967. "What I did I'm ashamed of, and I didn't mean to cause so much disgrace to the SEALs," says the 72-year-old Garofalo, noting his lies about his service have gotten "bigger and bigger" over the years. Retired SEAL Don Shipley alerted Fox to Garofalo's lies after the interview aired, and the network plans to run an on-air correction in addition to those online. (Its interview with Garofalo had been viewed 1.5 million times on Facebook.) "Unfortunately, all of Garofalo's claims turned out to be untrue," the Fox notice reads. "We apologize to our viewers, especially veterans and servicemen and women."
Summary: Fox News apologized for airing an interview with a US veteran who was found to have greatly exaggerated his military credentials, including being a former Navy SEAL and Vietnam veteran, and admitted to lying about his service.
Story: – Bill Cosby's retrial on sexual-assault charges has been pushed back after his new legal team successfully argued for a motion to delay Tuesday, USA Today reports. The trial had been scheduled to start Nov. 6 but now won't get underway until March or April. The delay will give Cosby's new defense team, which was just announced Monday and includes Michael Jackson's former attorney, time to catch up. "We're ready to proceed," says district attorney Kevin Steele, who NBC News reports was not happy about the delay. "It's a case that deserves a verdict."
Summary: Bill Cosby's retrial on sexual assault charges has been delayed until March or April due to his new legal team's successful motion to push back the trial date, giving them time to catch up on the case.
Story: – In what Deadline calls a "shock ruling," Midnight Rider director Randall Miller was set free Wednesday from a Georgia jail after serving only half of his plea-deal term for his role in the death of a 27-year-old camera assistant, the AP reports. The early release was due to prosecutors recently discovering that state law doesn't permit an inmate to serve more than one year at a state jail (as opposed to a prison), leading a judge to modify Miller's sentence from two years to one, Variety reports. The judge also took into account the fact that Miller's lawyers—who the Hollywood Reporter says tried to get him out twice before—and the DA's office had struck a "two-for-one" agreement of possible early release for good behavior before Miller entered his plea last year. Miller, who had pleaded guilty to criminal trespassing and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Sarah Jones, will continue his 10-year probation, which includes a mandate saying he can't direct a film or otherwise have any supervisory role overseeing safety in a film production. On Feb. 20, 2014, Jones was working on the set of the Gregg Allman biopic, filming a scene on train tracks in Wayne County, Ga., when she was struck by a train and killed, per the Reporter; eight others were injured, Variety notes. The movie production company had reportedly been denied access to the tracks and shot there anyway, leading to Miller becoming the first known filmmaker to be convicted and jailed for an on-set death. Jones' parents tell Variety they initially agreed to the plea deal placing Miller in jail instead of prison due to his health and say they never would have agreed to it if they had known he'd be released after one year. "We don't mean to inflict more pain to Mr. Miller's family," Jones' father, Richard Jones, said in court Wednesday. "It's about making the film industry a better, safer place." Others expressed their outrage more forcefully. "It's a complete miscarriage of justice and merely a slap on the wrist," one of Jones' former colleagues tells the Reporter. "One year in jail is hardly accountability."
Summary: Randall Miller, the director of "Midnight Rider," was released from a Georgia jail after serving only half of his plea deal term for his role in the death of a 27-year-old camera assistant, due to a discovery that state law does not permit inmates to serve more than one year in a state jail.
Story: – Everyone's got lots of questions about the American Health Care Act that passed the House last week, and Health and Human Services chief Tom Price seems like he'd be a good person to ask. Reporter Dan Heyman of Public News Service found out that wasn't the case with his queries, which led to his arrest Tuesday at the West Virginia State Capitol, the Hill reports. "First time I've ever been arrested for asking a question. First time I've ever heard of someone getting arrested for asking a question," Heyman noted at a presser shortly after he posted $5,000 bail. The question (or questions, rather) he posed in the Capitol hallway to Price, there with Kellyanne Conway to discuss the state's efforts to combat opioid addiction, revolved around whether domestic violence is considered a pre-existing condition under the AHCA. "He didn't say anything, so I persisted," Heyman, described by the Washington Post as a 30-year news veteran whose work has appeared on NPR and in the New York Times, said at the presser. Per the criminal complaint, Heyman was "yelling questions" and "aggressively breaching" Secret Service agents, and he had to be removed from the area more than once, per WDTV. He was charged with willful disruption of state government processes. But Heyman says he wasn't told he couldn't be there, was wearing a press pass, and identified himself as a reporter. Heyman says he was just doing his job in questioning AHCA specifics, noting, "I think it is a question that deserves to be answered." (Price seems optimistic on the GOP's plans.)
Summary: A reporter, Dan Heyman, was arrested at the West Virginia State Capitol while questioning Health and Human Services chief Tom Price about the American Health Care Act, specifically whether domestic violence is considered a pre-existing condition under the bill, despite identifying himself as a reporter and wearing a press pass.
Story: – A shipwreck that gave the world the deeply mysterious Antikythera mechanism is still yielding treasures—and teaching researchers about the lifestyles of the Greek and ancient. The latest finds at the ancient wreck dubbed the "Titanic of the ancient world" include a bone flute, a bronze armrest that may have come from a throne, glassware, fine ceramics, and a piece from an ancient board game. "This shipwreck is far from exhausted," a marine archaeologist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution says in a press release. "Every single dive on it delivers fabulous finds, and reveals how the '1%' lived in the time of Caesar." The wreck, which dates from around 65BC, was found by sponge divers off a Greek island in 1900 and Woods Hole says it is carrying out the first systematic excavation of the site, using information gathered by a robotic submersible last year, UPI reports. In fact, it's one of the biggest underwater archaeological projects in the world, notes New Scientist. The institute says that over the last month, good weather helped teams make more than 60 dives to the wreck's large debris field. "We were very lucky this year, as we excavated many finds within their context, which gave us the opportunity to take full advantage of all the archaeological information they could provide," an institute archaeologist says. One key, as New Scientist explains, is that divers have discovered they need to dig deeper into the ocean floor. One of the last searches of the year using this technique yielded a wine jug, small bronze pieces, and possibly part of a cooking pot. But researchers say they think far more significant finds await when next year's expedition begins. “There’s obviously stuff down there,” says one. “We just weren’t digging deep enough before.” (A maintenance crew uncovered an 18th-century shipwreck under a Maryland bridge.)
Summary: A recent expedition to the ancient Greek shipwreck, dubbed the "Titanic of the ancient world," has uncovered a variety of artifacts, including a bone flute, bronze armrest, glassware, fine ceramics, and a piece from an ancient board game, with researchers believing that there are still many significant finds waiting to be discovered.
Story: – Talks kick off today between Iran and the other P5+1 nations, and both sides were brimming with cautious optimism. Iranian negotiator Mohammad Javed Zarif touted the possibility of a breakthrough, while a senior Obama administration official said that they see "the outlines of a first step," the New York Times reports. Here are the stories about the talks today: The US wants Iran to freeze its nuclear activities, perhaps for six months, and negotiate a broader deal in the interim. In exchange, Iran would get some limited, temporary sanction relief. Exact details are hazy, but the five other negotiating nations have signed off on the plan, the Washington Post reports. This entire rapprochement with Iran kicked into high gear following a much-touted phone call from President Rouhani to President Obama. But the fateful call wasn't as spontaneous as it was made out to be, the Wall Street Journal revealed today. Obama had been quietly reaching out to Tehran for months, sources say. The administration hosted a series of secret meetings and calls with Iranian exiles and Arab monarchs, and gave Iranian expert Puneet Talwar free rein to converse with Iran. Susan Rice was also enlisted to talk with Iran's UN ambassador. Not everyone's thrilled about the thaw. Countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia have been making their displeasure known. "On a good day, we're paranoid about Iran," one senior Arab official says. And some in Washington are listening; Bob Corker is considering introducing legislation to block negotiations, mandating far greater concessions before sanctions are lifted, Fox News reports.
Summary: Iran and the P5+1 nations began high-level talks in Geneva today with cautious optimism, with the US seeking a six-month freeze on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for limited sanction relief, while Iranian negotiator Mohammad Javed Zarif and a senior Obama administration official expressed hope for a breakthrough.
Story: – "She probably never had a clue it was coming," says a fire chief in Oregon, where a 100-foot cedar tree took the lives of a pregnant woman and her unborn child in a freak accident. Kristi Leigh Oliver, 30, was killed when the cedar fell on top of her car near Portland early Tuesday. She was the lone occupant and leaves behind her husband Jeremy and their 3-year-old son, Mikey, reports the Oregonian. A GoFundMe page has been set up to raise money to help the family care for their son, who has celiac disease. Mike Weber, who was on his way to work at the time, was driving behind Oliver and witnessed the accident. "This tree, it just broke off out of nowhere," he tells KOIN. "It looked like it had exploded. But it hit her truck, spun her truck around." Weber says he ran to help but couldn't find a pulse, so he "just held onto her hand and prayed." He adds that the tree had "clearly been dead for years" and that his wife warns him not to drive along that road because of the dead trees. Not long after, family members arrived at the roadblock, where deputies tried to console them. (This freak car accident also involved no other vehicles.)
Summary: A pregnant woman and her unborn child were killed when a 100-foot cedar tree fell on their car in Oregon, after the tree had been dead for years and had been warned by locals not to drive along that road due to the dead trees.
Story: – President Trump's at-times awkward meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel was summed up as one that "could have been a lot worse" by German daily Bild, reports the New York Times, but Trump's comments on NATO are gathering some steam. During a joint news conference Friday, Trump thanked Merkel for working to move Germany toward paying 2% of its GDP to NATO (Germany currently pays 1.2%; only five of 28 member countries meet the 2% target). But on Saturday, he was more forceful on Twitter: "Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel," he tweeted. "Nevertheless, Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!" Which immediately prompted many to point out that the White House shouldn't hold its breath waiting for a check that decidedly won't be in the mail. Former permanent rep to NATO Ivo Daalder responded, "Sorry, Mr President, that’s not how Nato works. The US decides for itself how much it contributes to defending Nato. This is not a financial transaction, where Nato countries pay the US to defend them. It is part of our treaty commitment." Explains the Guardian in quoting Daalder, "ultimately, members’ contributions are based on each nation’s capability. Therefore, Nato member nations do not 'owe' or have to compensate any other country."
Summary: President Trump pressed Germany to increase its NATO contributions during a joint news conference with Chancellor Angela Merkel, but his demands were met with pushback from NATO officials and former permanent rep Ivo Daalder, who explained that member countries' contributions are based on their individual capabilities rather than financial transactions.
Story: – Iran has punished Google for not yanking a 14-minute YouTube trailer for the anti-Islam film Innocence of Muslims by doing some yanking of its own. The government is blocking Gmail and Google search functions, reports CNN. YouTube has been blocked in the country since mid-2009. The sites were blocked "because of public demand," Iran's Mehr news agency said yesterday. "Google and YouTube continued to carry the film clip that insulted our people's sacred beliefs." One analyst said the action likely won't continue for long, and that "any schoolchild" already knows how to dodge many blocks. Google and Gmail "will be filtered nationwide, and will remain filtered until further notice," says an adviser to Iran's public prosecutor's office. The notice was also sent out to Iranians via text messages, reports the BBC. There was no immediate response from Google, but the action wasn't likely to shock or hurt the company too much. Besides, Google was too busy smirking all the way to the bank.The company's stock hit an all-time high of $750.04 in late trading yesterday before a record closing price of $749.38, topping its last high set in late 2007, reports CNN.
Summary: Iran has blocked Google's Gmail and search functions in response to the company's failure to remove an offensive YouTube trailer, with the government citing public demand and the sites' continued carryage of the film clip despite previous blocks since mid-2009.
Story: – David Plouffe today sounded bullish on immigration reform, saying "there's no reason" that "it shouldn't pass," and adding, "this is the moment." He was less sure on gun control, Politico reports, saying "it is going to be a hard battle," but that there is "a very good opportunity." Looking ahead to his boss' nascent second term, he blasted congressional Republicans, saying that "the barrier to progress here is not the president. We need to see more Republicans in Congress willing to compromise, even on revenues." Elsewhere on the Sunday dial, as per Politico: John Barrasso on gun control: Harry Reid "has six Democrats up for election in two years in states where the president received fewer than 42% of the votes. And he doesn't want his Democrats to have to choose between their own constituents and the president's positions," ergo, he won't bring a bill to the Senate floor. Rick Santorum on immigration reform: "There's not a single Republican up on Capitol Hill who believes [Obama] wants to get it done. They all believe ... he will put [forward a] measure that the Republicans can't accept." Sen. Roy Blunt on Obama: “You’ve got to legislate, and you’ve got to legislate realistically. You don’t control the entire congress. It takes three entities to get a bill passed into law and you’ve got to come up with something that can pass a Democratic Senate, a Republican House, and the White House can at the end of the day be for."
Summary: David Plouffe expressed optimism about the potential for immigration reform, saying "there's no reason it shouldn't pass," but was less certain about gun control, calling it a "hard battle."
Story: – There was no hesitation or ambiguity from Eric Trump Thursday when 630 KHOW Denver host Ross Kaminsky asked him about Senate candidate and former Klansman David Duke: Trump's second son said the "disgusting" Duke "deserves a bullet." Trump agreed when Kaminsky suggested the Louisiana candidate "desperately deserves a bullet in the head," USA Today reports. "If I said exactly what you said, I'd get killed for it, but I think I'll say it anyway," Trump said. "The guy does deserve a bullet. I mean, these aren't good people. These are horrible people." "My father's the first Republican who's gone out and said, 'Listen, what's happened to the African-American community is horrible and I'm going to take care of it,'" said Eric Trump, accusing Democrats of trying to tie Duke to his father to make him seem like a "bigot, a racist, xenophobic, this and that." When reached by CNN for comment, Duke—who endorsed Trump for president earlier this year—said, "That's a good one," adding "I have to think about it." Earlier this week, the Trump campaign rejected the endorsement of the KKK's Crusader newspaper and condemned the burning of a Mississippi church by somebody who spray-painted "Vote Trump" on the building. (Duke's godson has rejected the white nationalist movement.)
Summary: Eric Trump stated that former Klansman David Duke "deserves a bullet" and accused Democrats of trying to tie Duke to his father to make him seem like a "bigot, a racist, xenophobic, this and that."
Story: – In 2013, the CEO of retail website Overstock.com revealed the company owned "some precious metals and maybe some Bitcoin" that could prove helpful in case of a shutdown of the banking system. That was a bit of an understatement. CEO Patrick Byrne tells Buzzfeed the Utah company actually has $10.3 million—$6 million in gold and $4.3 million in silver—hidden somewhere in the state so that it can continue to pay employees during an economic collapse. It also keeps thousands of emergency preparation kits and enough food to feed 2,000 employees and their families for 30 to 60 days, reports the New York Post. "I want a system that can survive a three-month freeze," Byrne tells Buzzfeed. Where exactly is this stash? Somewhere in a storage bunker, or bunkers, in Utah. To clarify, "we don't walk around with guns or something. We're not preppers," Byrne tells the Post, referring to the named used for those "prepping" for the apocalypse. But "so many signs tell me this country has lost its way, with a bankrupt business model," he adds, citing near-zero interest rates, the deficit, and poor-quality jobs. "If there's a financial system meltdown, if the Internet shuts down and credit cards shut down, we can pay people." He likens it to an insurance policy, "with a 5% chance of paying off." The store is a bit controversial considering Overstock lost $2.1 million in Q3, yet is investing $100 million in a new headquarters and $8 million in a Bitcoin stock exchange, notes the Post. (Last year, Overstock became the first online retailer to accept Bitcoin, notes Business Insider.) Still, Byrne's employees are apparently pleased. "A lot of people here liked that we did this for them," he says. "It's a very safe place to be if something happens." (Maybe he might want to buy this pricey bunker in Georgia, complete with its own power station.)
Summary: Overstock.com's CEO, Patrick Byrne, has revealed that the company has hidden $10.3 million in gold and silver in Utah to ensure continued payment of employees during an economic collapse, while also stockpiling emergency preparation kits and food for 2,000 employees and their families.
Story: – T-Mobile is ditching a once-inescapable part of wireless life: the contract. The company had been offering contract-free plans as an option alongside two-year contracts, CNET reports; now, according to the T-Mobile website, contract plans are a thing of the past. An example of a new plan: For $50 a month, you get unlimited talk, texting, and web, plus 500MB of high-speed data. Unlimited high-speed data will run you $70 a month. But that's not the full picture: You've also got to pay for your phone without the subsidies normally associated with contract plans, which knock pricey phones (new models can cost $600 to $700) way down (typically to around $200 with a two-year contract). Now, T-Mobile will now charge an upfront fee ($60 in the case of the $550 Galaxy S3) and tack the remainder of the cost onto the monthly bill for two years (in that case, $20 per month). The fees stop once the phone's paid for, and at that point, you own the phone. The Wall Street Journal observes that the move could prod customers to choose cheaper phones, as they do in Europe, Japan, and other unsubsidized markets. But it adds that it's a risky move for the fourth-place carrier, which has lost 4 million contract customers in the last two years.
Summary: T-Mobile has eliminated contract plans and now offers only contract-free plans with monthly fees for service and the cost of the phone paid over two years, with the option to own the phone outright after the payment period ends.
Story: – If doctors are correct that 6-year-old Addie Fausett of Utah won't live to see another Christmas, her family has arranged to make her last one memorable. When Addie, who stopped growing at age 3, said she wanted to have friends like her older sisters, her grandmother took to Facebook to make it happen, reports AP. She requested Christmas cards for her granddaughter, and now more than 1,000 arrive every day from around the world. "Grandma just wanted to be able to tell Addie she has a lot of friends," says Addie's mother, Tami Fausett. "My mom wanted Addie to think she was really loved. It worked." Addie's condition is undiagnosed, but it is now causing damage to her brain as well as leaving her growth stalled. She had been perfectly healthy until age 3. Utah station KSL provides the address for those interested in sending a card of their own: Box 162, Fountain Green, UT 84632.
Summary: A 6-year-old girl named Addie Fausett, who stopped growing at age 3 and has an undiagnosed condition causing damage to her brain, is receiving over 1,000 Christmas cards daily from around the world after her grandmother posted on Facebook to gather cards for her, with the goal of making her last Christmas memorable.
Story: – Religion makes people more generous and empathetic toward their neighbor, right? Wrong, according to a study published Thursday in Current Biology. Forbes reports researchers found children from religious backgrounds are actually less altruistic than children from secular households. Researchers tested more than 1,100 Christian, Muslim, and nonreligious children between the ages of 5 and 12 from around the world. They gave the kids stickers and had them choose how many to share with another anonymous child. It turns out secular children shared more of their stickers. "Our findings support the notion that the secularization of moral discourse does not reduce human kindness," lead researcher Jean Decety tells Science. "In fact it does just the opposite." But the relationship between religion and altruism in children was even more pronounced than that. Science reports the more religious a child's household—based on interviews with parents—the less generous the child. And while all kids shared fewer stickers as they got older, the difference was even more pronounced in kids from religious households, according to Forbes. Decety says the differences may be because of something called "moral licensing," in which an individual—unconsciously or not—feels like they can behave badly because they see themselves as a morally right person, Science reports. "These results reveal…how religion negatively influences children’s altruism, challenging the view that religiosity facilitates prosocial behavior," researchers conclude in the study.
Summary: According to a recent study, children from religious households are less altruistic than children from secular households, with more religious children sharing fewer stickers in a sharing game and the difference being more pronounced as they got older.
Story: – A freak injury may have just taken out the greatest closer of all time. Mariano Rivera tore his ACL and his meniscus while shagging flyballs during batting practice yesterday, likely ending his season and, many are speculating, his career. Rivera had already hinted that he might retire after this year. Asked if he thought he'd play again, Rivera whispered, "At this point I don't know. Going to have to face this first," Fox Sports reports. Catching balls in the outfield has been a pregame ritual for Rivera his entire career. Rivera considers himself a decent center fielder, and had even begged Joe Girardi to let him play the position before he retired, the New York Times points out. Girardi had refused, ironically, because he was worried about the risk of injury. "If it's going to happen, it's going to happen doing something I love to do. And shagging I love to do," said Rivera, who has a record 608 saves to his name. "I'd do the same thing, without hesitation."
Summary: Mariano Rivera tore his ACL and meniscus while shagging flyballs during batting practice, potentially ending his season and career, after hinting he might retire this year and despite his pregame ritual of catching balls in the outfield being a part of his career.
Story: – Scientists in China have genetically altered some 300 cows to produce "human" milk, the Telegraph reports. Using cloning techniques, scientists inserted human genes into cow embryos and implanted the embryos in mother cows. Scientists say the resulting dairy cows produced milk with "much higher nutritional content" than regular cow’s milk, including extra fat as well as proteins that support the immune system—meaning it could be an alternative to formula for babies. The researchers aim to have the product on shelves "in 10 years"—but the idea is already taking heat, due to concerns about its safety for babies and for the cattle who produce it. “There is a question about whether milk from these cows is going to be safe for humans, and it is really hard to tell that unless you do large clinical trials,” said a rep for a watchdog group. Of the 42 genetically-modified calves born in two experiments, only 26 survived, reports the Daily Mail. As for how the milk tastes? "Stronger than normal milk," said the lead researcher.
Summary: Scientists in China have genetically altered 300 cows to produce human milk, with higher nutritional content, but safety concerns and low survival rates among the genetically modified calves have raised questions about its safety for humans and cattle.
Story: – Just in time for the ancient and unspeakable ones to rise from their underground caverns on Halloween, KTVQ reports a large crack has mysteriously appeared in Wyoming's Bighorn Mountains. "Everyone here is calling it 'the gash,'" SNS Outfitter & Guides writes on its Facebook page. "It’s a really incredible sight." The local hunting company first snapped photos of the crack last week and estimates it's 750 yards long and 50 yards wide. According to CNN, the crevasse is many stories deep with a number of different levels stepping down into the earth. "It's a pretty good size," Seth Wittke, geologic manager with the Wyoming State Geological Survey, tells ABC News. "I wouldn't say it's huge. I think there's much bigger ones that we've seen in the state. It's definitely not a small one." Wittke says state geologists haven't gotten to check out the crack in person yet—it's not urgent because it's nowhere near infrastructure or settlements—so they aren't sure when it started or if it's still moving. The geological survey is calling the phenomenon an "apparent active landslide," for which it blamed groundwater, CNN reports.
Summary: A large crack has appeared in the Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming, measuring 750 yards long and 50 yards wide, with multiple levels stepping down into the earth, and is being called an "apparent active landslide" by state geologists.
Story: – As officers led newly captured fugitive Eric Frein from a courthouse in Pennsylvania today, the New York Times reports that they stopped for a moment as if to give the 150 or so bystanders a good look. Shouts of "Rot in hell," "You're not a real soldier," and "You're a coward" rang out, though Frein showed no reaction. Earlier, he had been arraigned on charges of murder, attempted murder, and possession of weapons of mass destruction in connection with the shooting of two troopers and his seven weeks on the run in the Poconos Mountains. "He was fully expecting to be caught," a federal law enforcement official tells the Philadelphia Inquirer. The investigator says Frein had spent "substantial time" in a hangar at the small airport where he was finally captured. US marshals were not acting on a tip when they found him outside the hangar, unarmed, but were following through on the grid strategy of searching employed throughout the manhunt, reports the Scranton Times-Tribune. As for the gash on Frein's nose and bruises on his face, a police official says they did not occur during or after the arrest. (Officers used handcuffs belonging to the trooper who was killed.)
Summary: Eric Frein, a fugitive accused of murder and attempted murder, showed no reaction as he was insulted and shouted at by bystanders during his capture outside a courthouse in Pennsylvania.
Story: – Thousands of students walked out of schools across the nation and even abroad as part of Wednesday's protest against gun violence, with the AP reporting that moods at the protests ranged from somber to angry. The walkout marked the one-month anniversary of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17, and while most walkouts were planned to last for 17 minutes at 10am local time, USA Today reports that in Parkland, Stoneman Douglas students rejected requests from administrators that they return to class and instead walked two miles alongside students from a nearby middle school to a memorial set up for the victims. Students across the US read poems, chanted and waved signs, and in some cases, faced consequences threatened by administrators. See some of the scenes in our gallery; the New York Times has live updates.
Summary: Thousands of students across the US and abroad walked out of schools on Wednesday to protest gun violence, with moods ranging from somber to angry, and some students defying administrators' requests to return to class and instead participating in memorial events for the victims of the Parkland shooting.
Story: – How many Americans does smoking kill each year? If you're going by the surgeon general, the answer is about 480,000. But a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests the number is actually more like 575,000. The issue is that only 21 causes of death are officially blamed on smoking, the Los Angeles Times explains—think heart disease, stroke, COPD, and certain cancers, including lung and esophageal. But those causes of death actually only account for 83% of deaths among smokers that the study tracked. The rest were caused by things like renal failure, infections, other cancers, and even accidents and suicide, which, the Times notes, "have a more tenuous link to smoking." Researchers looked at five large studies involving nearly a million people to compile the information. The diseases not officially caused by smoking were more likely to kill current smokers than nonsmokers: Breast cancer was 30% more likely to kill female smokers; prostate cancer was 40% more likely to kill male smokers; smokers were twice as likely to die of infections, hypertension, and certain digestive diseases than nonsmokers—and they were as much as 3.6 times more likely to die of cirrhosis. The comparisons go on, and in some cases, a smoker's risk was even greater the more cigarettes he or she smoked per day. Why? The study didn't actually establish a cause-and-effect relationship, the New York Times notes, but researchers offer explanations: in the case of infections, possibly because smoking hampers the immune system. For intestinal or digestive illnesses, possibly because smoking reduces blood flow to the intestines. The good news? If you quit, the higher risks fade the longer you stay away from cigarettes, Reuters reports. (If you do quit, you may have trouble finding "magic" lozenges.)
Summary: According to a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, smoking is estimated to cause 575,000 deaths in the United States each year, including 83% of deaths due to smoking-related causes such as heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers, as well as 17% of deaths due to other causes that are less directly linked to smoking, such as renal failure, infections, and accidents.
Story: – Mexican officials say they killed a Mexican drug kingpin three years after the government supposedly killed him the first time, Reuters reports. Nazario Moreno was leader of the drug cartel La Familia when officials said he died in a two-day gunfight with government agents—but as his cartel morphed into the more powerful Knights Templar, rumors circulated that Moreno was alive. "We can't confirm or deny it officially as long as we have no concrete evidence, and I can tell you that we have nothing," said Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam, the AP reports. Yet signs were there: The vicious Knights Templar continued the moral code and semi-religious doctrine of La Familia, and residents of the western state of Michoacan claimed to see Moreno around. Now officials say that Moreno, nicknamed "The Crazy One," has died in a firefight with the government at age 44, though forensic evidence is yet to confirm his identity. If true, Moreno's killing wraps up a strange year in which two Mexican drug kingpins—Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and Zetas chief Miguel Angel Trevino—were taken without a shot fired.
Summary: Mexican officials have confirmed the death of Nazario Moreno, aka "The Crazy One," a drug kingpin who was previously thought to have died in a gunfight with government agents three years ago, after he was killed in a recent firefight with the government at age 44, despite forensic evidence yet to confirm his identity.
Story: – The separatists who've seized government buildings in more than 10 Ukrainian cities say they don't intend to clear out, despite the agreement struck between Russia, the Ukraine, and Western powers yesterday that, among other things, called for those illegally seized buildings to be vacated. "This is a reasonable agreement," Denis Pushilin, self-proclaimed chair of the government in Donetsk, allowed, according to the AP. "But everyone should vacate the buildings, and that includes Yatsenyuk and Turchynov," referring to Kiev's acting prime minister and president. Pushilin argues that the Kiev government is just as illegitimate as his own. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov "did not sign anything for us," Pushilin added, according to CNN. "He signed on behalf of the Russian Federation." It's an open question how much power Russia wields over the separatists. Yesterday on his blog, NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe Philip Breedlove asserted that "what is happening in eastern Ukraine is a military operation," arguing that their training, equipment, and tactics all combined to prove that the masked, armed men are seasoned military personnel, not grassroots militiamen.
Summary: Separatist leaders in Ukraine have rejected a recent agreement reached between Russia, Ukraine, and Western powers, which called for the illegal occupation of government buildings to end, with one leader, Denis Pushilin, arguing that the Kiev government is just as illegitimate as his own.
Story: – ISIS has claimed responsibility for Saturday night's terrorist attack in London, though authorities say the claim has not been verified. The militant group's media agency Amaq announced late Sunday that a "detachment of Islamic State fighters" carried out the atrocity, in which seven people were killed and dozens more injured before police shot dead three attackers, reports Reuters. Police say they know the identities of the attackers who drove into pedestrians in London Bridge before running amok with knives, and they will release them "as soon as operationally possible," the BBC reports. At least 12 people were arrested in connection with the attack Sunday and two London addresses were searched early Monday. Police say they are trying to establish whether the attackers, who were wearing what turned out to be fake suicide belts, were part of a wider network. In Barking, east London, neighbors of a suspected attacker tell the Guardian that he was a married father of two children who attended a local mosque. One neighbor says she took photos of him and passed them to police because she feared he was radicalizing children in a local park. "They told me to delete the photos for my own safety, which I did, but then I heard nothing," she says. "That was two years ago. No one came to me. If they did, this could have been prevented and lives could have been saved." (Londoners fought back with bottles and chairs during the attack.)
Summary: ISIS has claimed responsibility for the London terrorist attack, although authorities have not verified the claim, with three attackers shot dead by police after killing seven people and injuring dozens more before being tackled by civilians with makeshift weapons.
Story: – Virginia health officials say there are now 40 confirmed cases of Hepatitis A that are connected to frozen strawberries used at Tropical Smoothie Cafe locations across the state, up from 28 cases less than a week ago. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release Monday that about 55% of the infected residents have been hospitalized, reports the AP. There are more than 500 of the smoothie franchises across the country, and Virginia is not the only state affected. All the potentially contaminated Egyptian-sourced berries were pulled from the 96 Tropical Smoothie Cafe locations in Virginia no later than Aug. 8 or Aug. 9. Officials say more cases could emerge, since some symptoms take as many as 50 days to emerge. The Hepatitis A virus affects the liver.
Summary: There are now 40 confirmed cases of Hepatitis A in Virginia linked to frozen strawberries used at Tropical Smoothie Cafe locations, with 55% of infected residents hospitalized, and over 500 franchises across the country affected, including Virginia, where all potentially contaminated berries were removed from 96 locations by Aug. 8 or 9.
Story: – In the fall of 2002, Vicky Ward was conducting research for an upcoming Vanity Fair article she was penning. Her subject: the "high-flying" and mysteriously wealthy Jeffrey Epstein, now a convicted sex offender recently tied to accusations that Prince Andrew had sex with an underage girl. Yesterday Ward published an article in the Daily Beast entitled "I Tried to Warn You About Sleazy Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein in 2003," claiming she had included bombshell allegations in the Vanity Fair draft from a 16-year-old girl and her older sister that Epstein had tried to seduce them—and that VF editor Graydon Carter ended up taking those allegations out, telling Ward, "[Epstein's] sensitive about the young women." She also said he added, "I believe him … I'm Canadian." The girls and their mom told Ward that Epstein had earned their trust and promised to financially help the older sister in her artistic pursuits. After the alleged seduction attempts, the family was scared Epstein would make them "look ridiculous" and maybe "hurt them," Ward says the mom told her. Epstein "went into overdrive" when he heard the charges, Ward adds, attacking her and her sources, showing up at VF's offices, and constantly calling Carter and Ward. "Just the mention of a 16-year-old girl … carries the wrong impression. I don't see what it adds to the piece. And that makes me unhappy," he reportedly said in one call. When Carter was asked via email yesterday by the Daily Beast why he nixed the girls' accounts, a VF spokeswoman responded, "Epstein denied the charges at the time, and since the claims were unsubstantiated and no criminal investigation had been initiated, we decided not to include them in what was a financial story." (Click for Ward's full piece, including something Epstein said to her that creeped her out.)
Summary: In 2002, journalist Vicky Ward was researching an article on Jeffrey Epstein for Vanity Fair, including allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls, which were ultimately removed from the article by the magazine's editor Graydon Carter due to Epstein's denials and lack of criminal investigation.
Story: – Here’s a Festivus miracle for you: An inmate in an Orange County Jail managed to get better food for months by saying he needed it to adhere to the “religion” of Festivus. Malcolm Alarmo King is a health nut, the Orange County Register explains, who didn’t want to eat the jail’s all-salami menu, so he asked for kosher, high-protein meals. The sheriff’s department complained that such pricier fare was reserved for those with religious restrictions. So King’s lawyer listed his religion as “Festivus.” No, you didn’t miss anything in that Seinfeld episode; keeping kosher is not one of the precepts of Festivus, a goofy made-up holiday that involves wrestling, an aluminum pole, and telling people how much they’ve disappointed you. But a judge bought it. King got his special diet for two months before the county got the court order thrown out, a sheriff’s spokesman tells the AP.
Summary: An inmate in an Orange County Jail successfully obtained kosher, high-protein meals for two months by listing his religion as "Festivus" despite the holiday not having any connection to kosher dietary restrictions.
Story: – Charles Smith's gun may have been fake, but a New York Court of Appeals ruling against him is very real. Per the Wall Street Journal, the court decided Tuesday to retain Smith's conviction of attempted first-degree robbery instead of reducing the charge, even though it was Smith's hand, not a firearm, under his hoodie when he told a teller at a Queens check-cashing store he had a gun and demanded money. The court says that, based on an interpretation of New York's penal law regarding robbery, the teller reasonably could have thought Smith really had a gun, warranting the higher charge. To bolster its decision for this 2011 case, the court cited a previous 1989 case it had ruled on in which it said the ball was in the defendant's court to prove there was no gun, the New York Law Journal reports.
Summary: A New York Court of Appeals has upheld Charles Smith's conviction of attempted first-degree robbery despite the fact that his gun may have been fake, as the court found that the teller at the Queens check-cashing store reasonably believed Smith had a real gun based on the circumstances.
Story: – A 6-month-old kitten is suspected of causing at least $5,000 in damage at a Florida animal shelter, the Miami Herald reports. According to WPLG, staff at the Florida Humane Society in Pompano Beach discovered their facility was seriously flooded last Thursday morning. They initially thought a pipe had burst until they realized that one of their adorable residents had actually managed to turn on a sink faucet, ABC News reports. The shelter is closed Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and staff believe the sink was running for 17 hours or so. There was at least 3 inches of standing water, affecting eight rooms in total. Meanwhile, the cats were high and dry in their beds and perches. The Humane Society is looking for donations to replace walls, cabinets, food, litter, and more ruined by the flooding and subsequent mold. “We can’t imagine what our next water bill is going to look like," volunteer Terry Arbour tells the Herald. Staff isn't naming the suspected kitty culprit. “We can’t be sure which cat did it, because we don’t have cameras in there, but we have a good idea because there was one younger female cat who really liked playing in sinks,” Arbour says. “It’s possible there was collusion from others.” The sink-loving kitty has apparently been adopted since the flood. Her new family has been warned.
Summary: A 6-month-old kitten is suspected of causing $5,000 in damage at a Florida animal shelter by turning on a sink faucet, flooding eight rooms with 3 inches of water, while the cats were left untouched in their beds and perches.
Story: – It's not just federal and state prisons that need scrutiny: The country's local and county jails are being "misused," and it's time for reform, a new report finds. Those held in the facilities are typically there for minor infractions, and over the past three decades, they've been kept inside longer and longer. Many simply lack the money to post bail, the report finds, and many are living with mental illness or struggling with drugs, leaving them unable to take care of themselves, the New York Times reports. Most inmates with mental illnesses don't get help in jail, and seeking it out can actually result in more time spent behind bars. Though violent and property crime plummeted between 1983 and 2013, the nationwide jail population on any given day surged over the 30 years, rising from 224,000 to 731,000, the Times reports. On an annual basis, the number of jail admissions approximately doubled over the same period, to 11.7 million, and many of those held are repeat offenders. The yearly cost of all this? Some $22.2 billion, the AP reports. But some help is on the way: The MacArthur Foundation is giving $75 million to jails seeking to cut back on the jailing of the groups identified in the report. "We've seen dramatic decreases in the number of people who go to jail in particular jurisdictions," a MacArthur rep tells the Huffington Post, "so we know that it can be done. It just has to be done on a broader scale and nationally."
Summary: According to a new report, local and county jails in the US are being misused, with many inmates held for minor infractions and subjected to lengthy stays, often due to a lack of bail and struggling with mental illness or drug addiction, resulting in an annual cost of $22.2 billion, but some help is on the way with the MacArthur Foundation providing $75 million to jails seeking to reduce the number of inmates incarcerated for these reasons.
Story: – Summer started off with a bang in the Northeast yesterday, with temperatures often higher than 90 degrees up and down the East Coast. In some states, the heat index hit as high as 105 degrees, and New York City and parts of New Jersey expect that number to get higher, CNN reports. The New York Times notes that it was the city's hottest day of the year—the temperature hasn't cracked the 90-degree mark since August—but today could be worse, with temps expected to reach 98 degrees. Relief is expected over the weekend, the New York Daily News adds, but expect triple digits in some areas before then. In Kentucky, high temperatures contributed to a tragedy this week: Lincoln Lindsay, eight months old, died after his father forgot to drop him off at day care and instead left him in his car seat while he went to work Monday. The temperature was around 90 degrees that day, meaning inside the car it was over 100 degrees; Lindsay was likely in the car for several hours. Authorities ruled the death an accident.
Summary: In the Northeast, temperatures soared to over 90 degrees and the heat index reached 105 degrees, with New York City and parts of New Jersey expecting even higher temperatures, while in Kentucky, an 8-month-old boy died after being left in a hot car for several hours.
Story: – Mayonnaise has standards, as its many and rabid devotees will tell you, and Hellmann's is going to bat for those standards: Set in its legal crosshairs is a product called Just Mayo, which, contends Hellmann's parent company Unilever, is not mayonnaise at all. Problem? Just Mayo—in an attempt to use plant-based ingredients instead of, oh, say, ingredients that may or may not come before the chicken—uses yellow peas instead of eggs. That makes it a spread, says Hellmann's, but to call it "mayonnaise" is false advertising. As the New York Times reports, the FDA defines mayonnaise as an emulsion of vegetable oil, either vinegar or lemon juice, and eggs. (See also: Kraft Miracle Whip, which doesn't meet the minimum percentage of vegetable oil outlined by the FDA, and has long had to market itself as a spread or salad dressing.) Which is where it all gets a little murky, notes the Wall Street Journal: Just Mayo's parent company, Hampton Creek, is branding its product as "mayo," not "mayonnaise," and it's trumpeting the lack of egg rather than trying to pull one over on consumers. But Just Mayo's label does contain the image of an egg, the Times notes; Unilever is suing for Hampton Creek to kill the egg image, cough up three times its profits in damages, and cover Unilever's legal fees. The mayo throwdown underlines shifting American tastes, as well as aging or archaic definitions of traditional food categories: The Times cites one lawyer/food blogger, who writes that "It’s not Hampton Creek’s fault if its innovation is outpacing federal regulations," which in this case date back to 1957. (One prominent hummus maker wants the FDA to step in and set some standards on the presence of chickpeas.)
Summary: Hellmann's is suing Just Mayo, a plant-based mayonnaise brand, for false advertising after the latter labelled its product as "mayo" despite not meeting the FDA's definition of mayonnaise, which requires eggs as an ingredient.
Story: – "It's not real clear how it all transpired," a Highway Patrol captain tells the AP, but for some reason, an Oklahoma man was shot dead by state troopers Friday night soon after the troopers were called out to save him from rising floodwaters. Police say there was a confrontation involving 35-year-old Tulsa man Nehemiah Fischer and his brother Brandon after they were asked to move to higher ground before they were swept away, Tulsa World reports. The brothers had been trying to push a car through rising waters, police say. "For whatever reason, and this is where it gets a little cloudy, (the men) approached the troopers," the captain says. "Shots were fired." Brandon was ultimately charged with assault and public intoxication. Friends and relatives say attacking police would be totally out of character for the late Nehemiah Fischer, an assistant pastor. "I don't get it. None of this is making any sense," a friend who has never known Fischer to drink or get in trouble tells the Guardian. "When I got the news that he was shot and killed ... You just shake your head and go: 'What is going on, did God run out of good bodies up there?' Because he's the last one you'd think that would be in this kind of trouble." Fischer's wife says she doubts the police version of events. "He would not be one to disrespect them or go after them," she tells Fox23. "If anything ever happened in the news that was negative toward police, he was more on the side of the police," she says. "So for something like this to happen just doesn't make any sense." The Highway Patrol captain tells the Guardian that Fischer had a handgun, but it isn't clear whether it was brandished during the incident. (Click for a much more uplifting story from the flooding.)
Summary: An Oklahoma man, Nehemiah Fischer, was shot and killed by state troopers while trying to push a car through rising floodwaters, despite his wife and friends saying he would not have disrespected or attacked the police.
Story: – MIT has ordered a review of its case against Aaron Swartz amid accusations that the institution helped drive the 26-year-old digital rights activist to his suicide last week, reports Mashable. Swartz was facing up to 35 years in jail and $1 million in fines for allegedly downloading millions of academic papers from the university's archive. MIT president Leo Rafael Reif says there will be "a thorough analysis of MIT’s involvement from the time that we first perceived unusual activity on our network in fall 2010 up to the present." "Now is a time for everyone involved to reflect on their actions, and that includes all of us at MIT," Reif said in a statement. "I want to express very clearly that I and all of us at MIT are extremely saddened by the death of this promising young man who touched the lives of so many. It pains me to think that MIT played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy." In a tribute to Swartz, Anonymous hackers attacked MIT's website yesterday and succeeding in taking it down for most of the day, the New York Times reports.
Summary: Aaron Swartz's suicide has prompted MIT to review its involvement in the case, including the university's response to his alleged downloading of millions of academic papers, with President Leo Rafael Reif expressing sadness and a commitment to reflecting on actions.
Story: – Tucson authorities are combing the city today in search of a 6-year-old girl who went missing from her own bedroom overnight Friday. The disappearance of Isabel Mercedes Celis is being termed "suspicious" or "possible abduction" by police, who say that the girl's parents discovered her missing at 8am yesterday. They reported her disappearance 15 minutes later, reports KVOA-TV. Between 75 and 100 rescuers searched in vain all day yesterday, notes the AP. "We're really surprised or shocked that anything like this could happen to our family," Isabel's uncle, Justin Mastromarino, said. No sign of forced entry was observed in the family home.
Summary: A 6-year-old girl, Isabel Mercedes Celis, went missing from her bedroom in Tucson overnight, with police terming the disappearance "suspicious" or "possible abduction," and rescue efforts throughout the day yielding no signs of forced entry in the family home.
Story: – While most fathers may consider themselves priceless, it turns out you can attach a dollar-value to Dad. And sorry, guys, it's lower than Mom's. Insure.com crunched the numbers associated with the tasks involved in daddy-duty, and came up with a figure of $23,344 a year. Bloomberg explains that the annual index uses Bureau of Labor Statistics wages to figure out how much all that barbecuing, driving, soccer coaching, and spider killing add up to. Helping with homework turns out to be the most money-making dad job, accounting for $9,170 of the total. Dealing with those spiders and other bugs is the smallest contributor: That job is worth $57 a year. The 2013 total represents a hefty 15% rise over last year, thanks to wage bumps among occupations like plumbers. Mom's 2013 market value is $59,862. (We recommend you refrain from gloating until tomorrow, ladies.)
Summary: According to Insure.com, the monetary value of a father's duties and responsibilities in 2013 was $23,344 per year, with the most valuable job being helping with homework at $9,170 and the least valuable being dealing with spiders and other bugs at $57.
Story: – Author Kathryn Stockett's best-seller The Help borrows a little too heavily from real life and from one life in particular, according to a nanny suing the author. Ablene Cooper says the book's character "Aibeleen"—who, like her, is a middle-aged black nanny with a gold tooth whose son died before she started working for her employers—is based on her and she finds the portrayal humiliating, ABC News reports. Cooper works for Stockett's brother, who has taken the nanny's side in the dispute. "Ain’t too many Ablenes," says Cooper. She is seeking $75,000 from Stockett and says she asked the author not to use her name or likeness. The lawsuit doesn't request punitive damages or attorneys' fees. Stockett ignored the request, despite knowing that doing so would be "emotionally upsetting and highly offensive to Ablene," Cooper's lawyer says. The novel, set in Jackson, Mississippi, during the early '60s, has been made into a movie that will be released this summer. (Click for more on the 'dirty secrets' of The Help.)
Summary: A middle-aged black nanny, Ablene Cooper, is suing author Kathryn Stockett for using her likeness and personal experiences in Stockett's best-selling novel "The Help," without her consent, with Cooper seeking $75,000 in damages.
Story: – After 15 years of near austerity, US airlines are restoring some small perks for passengers crammed into coach. Don't expect ample legroom or free checked bags. But fliers will find improved snacks, a larger selection of free movies, and—on a few select routes—the return of free meals. On Monday, American Airlines became the latest carrier to add something back. It announced the return of free snacks in the economy section and more free entertainment options on some aircraft, the AP reports. American, which recently merged with US Airways, hasn't offered free snacks since 2003; US Airways stripped passengers of snacks in 2008. This month, American will start offering Biscoff cookies or pretzels to passengers flying between New York and San Francisco or Los Angeles. By April, that will expand to all domestic routes. In May, American will bring back full meal service for coach passengers between Dallas and Hawaii. United recently announced the return of free snacks on its flights starting in February. American is also expanding its complimentary entertainment on domestic flights with in-seat TVs. Passengers will be able to choose from up to 40 movies, 60 TV shows, and 300 music albums. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the subsequent recession, US airlines stripped almost every perk imaginable on domestic flights. Hot meals disappeared along with legroom, blankets, and pillows. "It was really about survival," says an American marketing exec. Since then, mergers have created four mega-carriers that control more than 80% of the domestic market. They started charging $25 for each checked bag and crammed more seats into planes to maximize profits. Now the industry is making record profits. (Click for more.)
Summary: After 15 years of cutting back on perks, US airlines are gradually restoring some small amenities for economy class passengers, including improved snacks, more free entertainment options, and in some cases, free meals.
Story: – A kind-of clever live Internet petition launched by the Republican National Congressional Committee to attack ObamaCare went embarrassingly awry when it was hijacked by pranksters, reports Wired. The "I want repeal" petition on Tumblr allowed users to "sign" the petition and watch their name "print out" on a video stream along with others. But the screen was soon frozen when odd signatures started turning up, like Jesus Christ, Barf Vomit, Luigi Mario, Una Bohmer and Joe Mengele. A spokeswoman for the NRCC wasn't prepared to comment.
Summary: The Republican National Congressional Committee's live Internet petition to attack Obamacare was hijacked by pranksters, resulting in bizarre and humorous signatures such as "Jesus Christ" and "Barf Vomit" appearing on a video stream.
Story: – Two crazy tales from annals of US retail: Hero at Target: Police in California's Bay Area say Target employee Roxanna Ramirez saved a kidnapped girl by being alert. Ramirez explains to ABC 7 that she grew suspicious of a fidgety man in her Pittsburg store—her job is to watch for shoplifters—who then went out to the parking lot and stayed for hours, acting like a "weirdo." At one point, she saw him grab his steering wheel and shake it. She took down his license plate number, just in case, then phoned it in to police later that night when she heard of an Amber Alert for a missing 7-year-old girl. (Descriptions of the suspect and car in the alert rang bells.) Sure enough, police soon tracked down and arrested 43-year-old suspect David Douglas. They found the girl, too, and she's fine. "What she did was what truly broke the case," an Antioch police official tells the Contra Costa Times. Walmart fires beer guy: A much lighter story, but no happy ending. Last week, a Walmart manager in Titusville, Florida, suspected two men of stealing beer, so he went out to the parking lot to get their license plate as they were leaving. Mike Dawson then jumped into the back of their pickup because he says it was the only way to avoid getting hit. Then came a high-speed ride over 15 miles, during which Dawson signaled to another driver that he was in trouble. That driver pulled a gun and forced Dawson's driver to slow down, allowing Dawson to escape, reports NBC Miami. Police later arrested the pickup's driver, who now faces kidnapping charges in addition to robbery charges. Walmart, however, has since fired Dawson, reports WESH. He should have just taken the plate number and left it at that, says the chain. It's not the first time a Walmart employee has been fired for trying to help.
Summary: A Target employee in California saved a kidnapped 7-year-old girl by alerting police after a suspicious man in the store parking lot matched the description of an Amber Alert suspect, while a Walmart manager in Florida was fired after he jumped into the back of a pickup truck being driven by suspected beer thieves, leading to a high-speed chase and kidnapping charges.
Story: – High school students who studied instead of watching Jersey Shore say they've been left at a disadvantage by a question on the SAT college entrance exam. The students complain that the essay question, which deals with the nature of reality shows, assumes that all students have a television and watch plenty of trashy reality TV, reports the Washington Post. “I’m proud he doesn’t watch television and then he goes into the one test that really counts and he gets pummeled," one father complained. The question is part of the writing portion of the test and counts toward one third of students' SAT scores. “This is one of those moments when I wish I actually watched TV,” one test-taker said. “I ended up talking about Jacob Riis and how any form of media cannot capture reality objectively. I kinda want to cry right now." Another student told the New York Daily News: ”I guess the kids who watch crap TV did well. I was completely baffled." The director of the SAT program says the question contained enough information for anybody to be able to answer it. "The primary goal of the essay prompt is to give students an opportunity to demonstrate their writing skills,” she said.
Summary: High school students who avoided watching Jersey Shore were disadvantaged on the SAT exam due to an essay question that assumed all students watch reality TV, leading to confusion and frustration among test-takers.
Story: – The Supreme Court kicked off the first of the seven biggest decisions it's issuing in the coming days with another major win for ObamaCare. The verdict: The court upheld the federal tax subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, voting 6-3 to preserve health insurance for 8.7 million Americans and solidifying President Obama's signature domestic achievement, the AP reports. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy—who dissented in the 2012 decision upholding the law—sided with their liberal colleagues in the vote. Writing for the majority, Roberts stated, "Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them." Further, "tax credits are available to individuals in states that have a federal exchange," per the Los Angeles Times. If the credits were disallowed, he continued, it "could well push a state's individual market into a death spiral." Meanwhile, Justice Antonin Scalia calls the majority's decision "pure applesauce" and accuses his colleagues of "interpretive jiggery-pokery" in a 21-page dissent that nearly reaches Walt Frazier levels with its colorful language, Talking Points Memo reports. "You would think the answer would be obvious—so obvious there would hardly be a need for the Supreme Court to hear a case about it," he writes, per Mother Jones, adding in a comment that's getting lots of Twitter reaction as one of the snarkiest comments made about the case yet: "[The decision] rewrites the law to make tax credits available everywhere. We should start calling this law SCOTUScare." Joining him in his dissent were justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, TPM notes.
Summary: The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to uphold federal tax subsidies for the Affordable Care Act, preserving health insurance for 8.7 million Americans and solidifying President Obama's signature domestic achievement.
Story: – More than 3 million women joined women's marches around the country and around the world on Sunday—and more than one elected official appears to have forgotten that women vote. In several states, lawmakers and other official faced angry backlashes after insulting marchers. A roundup: Judge Bailey Moseley, who serves on Texas' 6th Court of Appeals in Texarkana, deleted a Facebook post after heavy criticism, the Star-Telegram reports. "Just think about this," wrote Moseley. "After just one day in office, Trump managed to achieve something that no one else has been able to do: he got a million fat women out walking." DallasNews notes that Moseley's website claims that he is "known for his strong integrity." In Indiana, state Sen. Jack Sandlin withdrew a similar Facebook post describing the marchers as "fat women walking," the Indianapolis Star reports. He apologized and said he wasn't sure how the meme ended up on his wall. Another state Republican, Rep. Jim Lucas, refused to delete a Facebook post showing a woman getting pepper-sprayed in the face with the caption: "Participation trophies now in liquid form." WRAL reports that in North Carolina, newly elected state insurance commissioner Mike Causey, a Republican, apologized after sharing yet another "fat women walking" post. "This does not reflect my feelings toward women, and in the future, we will manage social media in a more responsible manner," he said in a statement Monday. In Mississippi, state Sen. Chris McDaniel is taking flak for a Facebook post in which he describes the millions of marchers as "unhappy liberal women," WLOX reports. "If they can afford all those piercings, tattoos, body paintings, signs, and plane tickets, then why do they want us to pay for their birth control?" the Republican wonders. The insults, like the marches, were global. "Don't these clowns have anything else better to do with their time other than to hold sad, anti-democracy protests?" Australian far-right leader Pauline Hanson said in a Facebook post, wondering why people were walking around in the summer heat protesting the American president. But "I suppose it's good that they were out and about and doing a bit of walking because it looked like a few of them needed to get a bit of sun and do a bit exercise." News.com.au notes that the One Nation party leader may have been annoyed by one of the chants that could be heard from Brisbane protesters: "Donald Trump, go to hell. Take One Nation there as well."
Summary: More than 3 million women participated in Women's Marches around the world, prompting some male politicians to post insulting comments on social media, including describing the marchers as "fat women walking," "unhappy liberal women," and suggesting they should pay for their own birth control.
Story: – For six years, a small team of Norwegians has worked tirelessly to recover a famous shipwreck in the remote hamlet of Cambridge Bay in Nunavut, a northern territory of Canada—and as of Saturday, they were finally able to lift it off the ocean floor thanks in large part to giant sausage-shaped balloons. "This is a milestone," Jan Wanggaard, project manager for the Norway-based organization Maud Returns Home, tells the CBC. "To actually see her releasing from the seabed—it's a great experience." He says he was in the water inflating one of the balloons when it first lifted off the seabed and the water became dusty. "I thought, 'Ah, that's a bit strange,'" he says. "I came to the surface and I saw my friend with a big smile." The Maud belonged to Arctic explorer Roald Amundsen, who failed to cross the North Pole between 1918 and 1920, then went bankrupt and sold the ship to the Hudson Bay Company. From there, it was put to use as a floating warehouse before sinking off Cambridge Bay in 1930. Wanggaard hopes to return the Maud to Norway, where Amundsen remains a national hero, before cleaning it up and putting it on display, reports Nunatsiaq Online. For now, the team plans to fully lift the nearly 600,000-pound vessel by sinking a barge beneath the Maud, draining the barge's water tanks to make it float, and bringing it safely to the surface on the barge, giving it a chance to dry out over the winter before a return trip home. "If you were a kid, I’m sure you would love [the challenge]," Wanggaard says. (Check out this summer's South Pole rescue attempt.)
Summary: A small team of Norwegians has successfully lifted a famous shipwreck, the Maud, off the ocean floor in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut, using giant sausage-shaped balloons, with plans to return it to Norway for restoration and display.
Story: – Veronica Mars already set a Hollywood precedent by turning to Kickstarter for a successful fundraising campaign. Now it will set another on its release date of March 14, reports the Wall Street Journal. Warner Bros. will make the movie available online and for video-on-demand services the same day it opens in theaters, a first for any of the major studios. Normally, big theater chains demand a 90-day window before movies become available elsewhere, but Warner Bros. is getting around that with a technicality: It's actually renting 260 theaters from AMC to show the movie. Is this the way of the future? Variety doesn't think so, calling this a "one-off" exception to make good on filmmaker Rob Thomas' promise to Kickstarter donors for a limited theatrical release. What's more, given the TV series' strong fan base, the movie is likely to make most of its money not in theaters but in rentals and DVD purchases. "The existence of Kickstarter and the emergence of the social Internet make something like this possible," says a Warner exec. "The economics work."
Summary: Warner Bros. is releasing the movie "Veronica Mars" in theaters and online on the same day, bypassing the typical 90-day theatrical window, through a technicality involving renting 260 theaters from AMC.

Story: – On June 24, Lindsay Bugbee Crosby of Simsbury, Conn., gave birth to her third child, a healthy baby boy named Nolan. A happy photo shows the smiling mom celebrating in the hospital with husband Evan and daughters Finlay, 5, and Sigrid, 3. Within a week, however, the 32-year-old was back in the hospital with a strep infection, and she died on July 4, reports the Hartford Courant. Bugbee Crosby developed Group A strep, which led to more serious sepsis as her body fought the infection. Sepsis accounts for about 13% of pregnancy-related deaths in the US, according to CDC stats cited by People. Two separate fundraisers at GoFundMe, here and here, have so far raised more than $370,000 for the family. "It has meant so very much to us," says a family statement. "The kind messages have been most comforting, and the generous and unexpected financial gifts will be very helpful in coping with unforeseen expenses." It's not clear what happened in Bugbee Crosby's case, but sepsis can occur as a result of complications during childbirth related to C-sections, ruptured membranes, or prolonged or obstructed labor.
Summary: Lindsay Bugbee Crosby, a 32-year-old mother of three from Connecticut, died from sepsis after developing Group A strep infection following the birth of her third child, with funds raised through GoFundMe reaching over $370,000 for her family.
Story: – The energetic, down-to-earth Mitt Romney who wowed at the first presidential debate is taking his new show on the road, Politico reports. Stumping in Florida, the GOP candidate has ditched his old CEO persona for a man who tells warm, personal stories about people who are dying. One was an old college chum paralyzed in an accident, whom Romney comforted by saying, "Billy, I love ya and God bless ya." Romney softly added, "It’s rare that you get the chance to tell someone how much you love them while you still can." But Politico notes that Romney 2.0 may be too little too late to capture the last undecided voters, and is still viewed more unfavorably than favorably in a new poll. John Dickerson, reeling on Slate over Romney's pivot to the center, asks whether Mitt will "be a moderate of the center-right as he appeared to be on the debate stage or will he be the ruthless realist" of last month. Regardless, the reboot seemed to work with Floridians: "He makes himself more vulnerable," said one. "Everyone has him on this pedestal ... but stories like this make him more human."
Summary: Mitt Romney is taking his new, more personal and vulnerable approach to the road, sharing warm stories about people he has known and comforted, but it may be too little, too late to sway undecided voters, who still view him unfavorably according to a new poll.
Story: – The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against Puerto Rico in a politically charged dispute over the island's power to enforce its own criminal laws. The justices ruled 6-2 that the US territory can't prosecute people for local crimes if they've already been convicted of similar charges in US federal court, reports the AP. The ruling helps clarify the island's legal status at a time when the issue has caused deep divisions between officials from the US and Puerto Rico. The court sided with two men who said the principle of double jeopardy prevented Puerto Rico officials from prosecuting them on weapons charges after they had already pleaded guilty to federal charges for the same offense. Puerto Rico officials had argued that the island could still bring charges under its own laws—something that the 50 states have power to do under the principle of state sovereignty. But "there is no getting away from the past," wrote Justice Elena Kagan. "Because the ultimate source of Puerto Rico's prosecutorial power is the federal government ... the Commonwealth and the United States are not separate sovereigns." USA Today sums up the ruling thusly: "Puerto Rico has its own Constitution and elects its own leaders, but it remains under the thumb of Congress." Justice Stephen Breyer dissented from the majority decision, saying that over time, the source of Puerto Rico's criminal law "ceased to be the US Congress and became Puerto Rico itself, its people and its constitution." He was joined by Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
Summary: The Supreme Court ruled that Puerto Rico cannot prosecute individuals for local crimes if they have already been convicted of similar federal charges, as the island's power to enforce its own criminal laws is derived from the federal government and Puerto Rico is not a separate sovereign entity.
Story: – Boston hasn't clinched a World Series at home in nearly a century, and that's translating into a big payday for those willing to sell tickets to tonight's Game Six. Consider that someone paid $24,000 on StubHub for two front-row tickets near home plate, reports ESPN. But even the cheap seats aren't so cheap, with the average ticket price now north of $2,000 and climbing. One thing that helps is old-fashioned supply and demand, notes the Christian Science Monitor: Fenway holds a relatively small capacity of about 37,000.
Summary: The high demand for tickets to Game Six of the World Series at Fenway Park has led to inflated prices on the secondary market, with some tickets selling for thousands of dollars, despite the century-long drought in the team's home stadium winning the series.
Story: – Your daily blood boil: A former bank executive has pleaded guilty to using bailout money to buy a waterfront condo. In 2009, Darryl Layne Woods bought the luxury digs with some $381,000 of the $1 million given to Mainstreet Bank in Ashland, Mo., where he was the chairman at the time, the New York Times reports. "At a time when many other Americans were losing their homes, he was siphoning off public funds to buy a luxury vacation condo in Florida," says a US attorney. His punishment? At most, a year in federal prison and a $100,000 fine, reports the Huffington Post. According to prosecutors, Woods also tried to cover his crime up. Per the Times, when a TARP investigator asked him to account for how the money had been spent, he sent a letter saying: "We are a small central Missouri community bank and while I would like to be able to provide you with very specific and quantitative responses we are currently operating under the assumption that the worst scenario could occur and the TARP proceeds will provide vitally needed infusions to a bleeding patient." Woods has not yet received his sentence, but at the very least, he will be banned from working in the banking industry again.
Summary: A former bank executive pleaded guilty to using bailout money to buy a luxury condo in Florida, despite the fact that many Americans were losing their homes, and faces a maximum sentence of a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.
Story: – Vice President Mike Pence left the 49ers-Colts game early Sunday after more than 20 of the 49ers players kneeled during the national anthem. Pence, the former governor of Indiana, was in Indianapolis to celebrate Peyton Manning's jersey retirement and induction into the Colts' Ring of Honor during Sunday's game at Lucas Oil Stadium; after leaving the game, he sent out a series of tweets explaining his decision, ESPN reports. "I left today's Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem," he wrote. "At a time when so many Americans are inspiring our nation with their courage, resolve, and resilience, now, more than ever, we should rally around our Flag and everything that unites us." He continued, "While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem. I stand with President Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem." Trump himself also weighed in on Twitter: "I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen." Added Eric Trump, "Vice President Pence is truly an amazing man! Thank you for standing up for our country and for the respect of our great flag!" Per the Washington Post, the media pool was told Pence may leave the game early; members were kept in vans before the game instead of being taken inside with Pence.
Summary: Vice President Mike Pence left a NFL game between the 49ers and Colts early after more than 20 49ers players knelt during the national anthem, citing his respect for the flag and national anthem, and expressing solidarity with President Trump.
Story: – A reindeer herder describes himself as "dizzy with anger" after freight trains barreled into more than 100 reindeer in Norway over three days, killing 106. Torstein Appfjell, who Sky News reports oversees about 2,000 reindeer, calls the deaths "totally tragic" and frames that toll in that period as "unprecedented." Appfjell says the deadliest day was Saturday, when 65 were killed, reports the AP. Deutsche Welle has this tough detail: Per a documentary filmmaker who was on the scene, some animals were not killed upon impact and had to be shot. The animals are undertaking their winter migration, which sees them travel from mountainous pastures to the coast in search of food. It's a perilous journey, and deaths are not uncommon. Though Appfjell says train accidents previously killed a maximum of 250 reindeer over 12 months, Deutsche Welle reports a far higher toll, saying 2,000 have lost their lives along the northern railway line over the 2013 to 2016 period. Suggestions that a fence be added along the line have gone nowhere due to a lack of funding, though train drivers have now been told to reduce their speeds in the area. (More than 300 reindeer lost their lives in a very different kind of accident last year.)
Summary: A reindeer herder in Norway is "dizzy with anger" after more than 100 reindeer were killed by freight trains over three days, with the deadliest day resulting in the deaths of 65 reindeer, and some animals had to be shot after being injured but not killed upon impact.
Story: – Now that Moscow is on board with the thinking that a bomb brought down a Russian passenger jet over Egypt, a newspaper in Russia is reporting that the explosive was in a surprising place: the main passenger cabin. The Kommersant quotes an anonymous investigator who says the device was likely placed under a passenger seat near a window in the tail section, not hidden in the cargo hold, reports Reuters. How it got there remains under investigation, but NBC News reports that Egyptian authorities have detained two workers at the Sharm el-Sheikh airport. So far, no arrests have been made. Vladimir Putin is talking tough, saying of the terrorists responsible, per the Straits Times: "To forgive them is up to God, but to send them to him is up to me." Russia has offered a $50 million reward in what it now considers to be an ISIS attack, and the New York Times reports that Moscow has begun working closely with France on airstrikes in Syria. President Obama, too, expressed a willingness to coordinate more with Russia, though the Times notes that the two countries' fundamental disagreement on whether Bashar al-Assad should stay in power will limit that. The crash of the Metrojet plane killed all 224 people aboard.
Summary: A bomb was discovered in a surprising location, the main passenger cabin, near a window in the tail section of the Russian passenger jet that crashed in Egypt, according to an anonymous investigator, with Egyptian authorities detaining two workers at the Sharm el-Sheikh airport and Russia offering a $50 million reward and working closely with France on airstrikes in Syria.
Story: – A suicide bomber struck at an Iraqi market today, but seldom have such attacks been so deadly: Reuters puts the death toll at more than 100 and reports that the Islamic State claimed responsibility, boasting that the vehicle used in the blast had 3 tons of explosives. The explosion brought down multiple buildings in the town of Khan Bani Saad, northeast of Baghdad, which AFP notes is predominately Shiite. Victims had packed the market to gather food in preparation for the end of the fasting month of Ramadan. "Some people were using vegetable boxes to collect children's body parts," says a police major.
Summary: A suicide bomber killed over 100 people, including many Shiites, in a market in Khan Bani Saad, northeast of Baghdad, when a vehicle packed with 3 tons of explosives was detonated, with the Islamic State claiming responsibility and boasting of the attack's deadliness.
Story: – United Airlines is apologizing yet again after a mom was forced to hold her 2-year-old son for a 3.5-hour flight—because the airline gave away his seat. Shirley Yamauchi, 42, says she paid nearly $2,000 for two tickets for herself and her son, Taizo, to fly from Hawaii to Boston with a layover in Houston, and checked in well in advance of the final leg of the journey on June 29. But shortly before takeoff, Yamauchi says a man boarded and said he'd bought a ticket for Taizo's seat on standby. When Yamauchi notified a flight attendant, she says she got only a shrug. "I had to move my son onto my lap. He's 25 pounds. He's half my height," she tells Hawaii News Now. "It was unsafe, uncomfortable and unfair." United's own ticketing policy says children must be in their own seat once they reach age 2, notes NBC News. Taizo is 27 months. Yamauchi, who is 5-2, says she "lost feeling in my legs and left arm" as she held onto her son, who had to stand on the floor when he became too heavy, per KITV. The station notes that FAA guidelines advise parents against holding kids on their laps. She wanted to complain but remembered other United incidents in the news. "The violence. Teeth getting knocked out," she says. "I'm Asian. I'm scared and I felt uncomfortable. I didn't want those things to happen to me." Five days after the flight, United offered Yamauchi a refund for Taizo's ticket, a travel voucher, and an apology, claiming Taizo's boarding pass wasn't properly scanned and gate agents believed he hadn't checked in. But Yamauchi says she saw agents scan Taizo's ticket. "It just doesn't add up," she says.
Summary: A mother was forced to hold her 2-year-old son on her lap for a 3.5-hour flight after a standby passenger boarded and took the child's seat without notice, despite United Airlines' own policy requiring children to be in their own seat after age 2, causing discomfort and safety concerns for both the mother and child.
Story: – Diet soda might help with the waistline, but a new study suggests it's bad for the brain. Researchers in Massachusetts found that those who drank at least one artificially sweetened beverage per day were about three times as likely to experience a stroke or dementia compared to those who did so less than once a week, reports the Guardian. Specifically, daily diet soda drinkers were 2.96 times more likely to experience an ischaemic stroke and 2.89 times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s, per the study in the American Heart Association journal Stroke. The study was based on questionnaires filled out by more than 4,300 adults as part of the Framingham Heart Study at Boston University. “To our knowledge, our study is the first to report an association between daily intake of artificially sweetened soft drink and increased risk of both all-cause dementia and dementia because of Alzheimer’s disease,” write the co-authors. They emphasized that they found just an association, not a causal link, and say more research is necessary to expound on the results. But the author of an editorial accompanying the study says it suggests that artificial sweeteners could do damage to the brain "through a vascular pathway," per CNN. (One columnist thinks diet soda has been unfairly vilified.)
Summary: Drinking diet soda daily may increase the risk of stroke and dementia, according to a study of over 4,300 adults, with a 3-fold higher likelihood of ischaemic stroke and 2.96 times higher likelihood of Alzheimer's disease compared to those who drink it less than once a week.
Story: – Vincent van Gogh's paintings of sunflowers aren't as vivid as they used to be and the sun is to blame, say researchers who have solved a problem that has long stumped art conservationists. A team of chemists experimenting with ultraviolet light and tubes of paint belonging to 19th-century artists found that by mixing in white paint to make his yellows brighter, van Gogh doomed his sunflowers to turn brown over time, the Guardian reports. "While he wanted to show a light, pale and delicate yellow, it instead becomes a darker, brownish yellow" after sunlight kicks off a chemical reaction, the lead researcher explains. To preserve van Gogh's masterpieces and other works from the same era, he says, conservationists will need to keep the paintings cool in summer—and away from sunlight. "This type of cutting-edge research is crucial to advance our understanding of how paintings age and should be conserved for future generations," an official at Amsterdam's van Gogh Museum tells LiveScience.
Summary: Researchers have discovered that Vincent van Gogh's use of white paint in his sunflower paintings leads to a chemical reaction that causes the yellow to darken and turn brown over time, and to preserve these masterpieces, conservationists must keep them cool in summer and away from sunlight.
Story: – Another Halloween, another white person dons blackface with predictable results. This time, it's actress Julianne Hough getting most of the heat, though there's apparently plenty of Travyon Martin impersonators out there, too, writes Roxane Gay at the Los Angeles Times. We're still taking about this? She discounts the "nonsense" defenses that involve free speech or the plea to lighten up because, hey, it's just a joke. People are apparently ignorant of the horrible history of blackface and its use in degrading African Americans, she writes. "They think they’re being funny, but really, they’re using the freedom of Halloween, the pass we all get to indulge our secret selves, to say, to people of color: 'This is how we see you. This is how we think of you.'" At Grantland, Rembert Browne takes more of a deadpan approach in advising white people to skip the blackface. "Chances are, if someone tells you they were hurt by Julianne Hough's Halloween outfit, they are exaggerating," he writes. "But what is felt is merely a continuation of a long-held face-in-palm reaction, less 'how dare they' and more 'they'll never learn.' 'They' being white people, you see." Hough may be getting demonized unfairly, he adds. Then again, "is it fair that white people get to be white? No. Similarly, is it fair that I get to be black and white people don't? Also no. Nothing's fair." Click for his full column. Or for Gay's full column.
Summary: Actress Julianne Hough faced backlash for wearing blackface on Halloween, with critics arguing that it perpetuates a long history of degrading and dehumanizing African Americans, while some white people defend it as a form of free speech or a harmless joke.
Story: – How did a book many have never heard of, from both a new author and a new publisher, suddenly dethrone the book that had been at the top of the New York Times best-seller list for young adult fiction? It wasn't thanks to a publicity campaign or a celebrity bringing attention to it, and now, the Consumerist reports, the Times has removed the book from the list after an investigation led to accusations that the answer involves "gaming the system." It all started when the blockbuster YA novel The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas, which had been atop the list for 25 weeks, was replaced at the top by Handbook for Mortals by Lani Sarem. Fellow YA writer and publisher Phil Stamper first pointed out how suspicious this was, the Verge reports; for one, he couldn't find a physical copy of the book at any Barnes & Noble in the greater NYC area, and the Consumerist notes you also can't buy it on Amazon. Some bookstores ultimately revealed they'd gotten odd calls from people asking whether they reported sales to the Times; if the bookseller did, the person would place a bulk order for Handbook for Mortals, claiming the books were for an event, per NPR. Media news site Pajiba started an extensive probe and found the book (available on Kindle, despite physical copies being hard to track down) was the first novel from the GeekNation website's new publishing arm, and a movie based on the book was already listed as "in development" on IMDb. Some wondered whether the author and/or publisher was trying to manipulate sales numbers before the book was physically published to hype an upcoming film version; ultimately, multiple sources confirmed that had indeed been the plan. (Sarem, who denies this, says she's being cyberbullied.) The Times has since removed the book from its list; see Pajiba for more on the plot's intricacies.
Summary: A little-known book, "Handbook for Mortals" by Lani Sarem, dethroned the long-time best-selling "The Hate U Give" by Angie Thomas on the New York Times list after an investigation revealed that the book's publisher and author may have manipulated sales numbers to artificially inflate its popularity before its physical release and movie adaptation.
Story: – Amid a flurry of weddings expected to follow Australia's legalization of same-sex marriage Wednesday, there was also to be one divorce: Back in June 2015, Nick Jensen wrote an editorial explaining he and his wife of 10 years would dissolve their marriage as a "matter of conscience" if the government approved same-sex marriage. A Facebook event called "Celebrating Nick and Sarah Jensen's Divorce" was created in response and attracted more than 183,000 attendees, the Advocate reported at the time, but it seems the split will not come to pass. Continuing to argue that "a redefinition of marriage changes the agreement under which we were originally married," Jensen tells News.com.au his "previous public comments regarding civil divorce never envisaged me separating from my wife, but rather our marriage from the state." But he says "the legislation currently makes it untenable for us to do this under the law." Jensen did not elaborate, and said he would make no other comment. He previously explained any divorce from his high school sweetheart and "perfect match" was to be in legal terms only and the couple would still consider themselves "married by the Church and before God." Australian lawyer Michael Tiyce says he offered to help the couple navigate hurdles en route to their goal, including an initial one-year separation required under Australian law. "My firm does quite a bit of pro bono work in family law each year in the gay, lesbian and trans community. I thought offering assistance to Nick and Sarah would be an excellent way of reaching out across communities," he tells News.com.au, adding the couple did not accept his offer.
Summary: A couple in Australia, Nick and Sarah Jensen, have announced that they will not be divorcing despite the country's legalization of same-sex marriage, as they believe that a redefinition of marriage changes the original agreement they were married under and they will still consider themselves married in the eyes of God and their Church.

Story: – A man reported to be Tanzania's only billionaire and the youngest one in Africa has been kidnapped in what the BBC is calling a "huge shock." Mohammed Dewji was seized by masked gunmen Thursday morning as he entered a hotel gym in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam, considered to be very safe. It's the sixth abduction of a billionaire in Africa this year, but the first in Tanzania, reports the Citizen. "This kind of incident is new here," regional commissioner Paul Makonda says, per the AFP, adding "initial information indicates he was kidnapped by whites travelling in two vehicles." Three people have been arrested, though police are on the lookout for more abductors, said to have fired shots into the air before driving off with the 43-year-old father of three, who was without bodyguards. A former employee says Dewji has "always been incredibly relaxed in his approach to security" despite huge fame, per the BBC. He transformed his family's retail business MeTL into a company with diverse interests in some 10 countries, reports the AFP. A former legislator who attended Georgetown University, Dewji previously vowed to donate half his fortune to charity; Forbes puts his worth at $1.5 billion.
Summary: Mohammed Dewji, Tanzania's only billionaire and youngest in Africa, was kidnapped by masked gunmen in Dar es Salaam, the first such incident in the country, with three arrests made but more abductors still at large.
Story: – It's official: After a 20-month hiatus, Israeli and Palestinian leaders will resume direct peace talks. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced today that talks will begin Sept. 2 in Washington, with the goal of reaching a settlement within one year, the AP reports. "There have been difficulties in the past; there will be difficulties ahead. Without a doubt, we will hit more obstacles," she said. "The enemies of peace will keep trying to defeat us and to derail these talks. But I ask the parties to persevere." In addition to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, the leaders of Egypt and Jordan have also been invited. The talks will be a major victory for Obama and Hillary Clinton, who've made Mideast peace efforts a cornerstone of their foreign policy plans, reports the Wall Street Journal. But, the Journal notes, peace is a long way off; Netanyahu may be unwilling to make major concessions and Palestinians have often expressed that they feel they've been dragged to the table.
Summary: Israeli and Palestinian leaders will resume direct peace talks after a 20-month hiatus, with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aiming to reach a settlement within one year, despite past difficulties and ongoing opposition from both sides.
Story: – Those outraged by the death of Cecil the lion have one big question today: How's Jericho? That would be Cecil's brother, and there's conflicting reports about his well-being. A senior official with Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe tells CNN that he was shot dead by an illegal hunter. "It is with huge disgust and sadness that we have just been informed that Jericho, Cecil's brother has been killed at 4pm today," the Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force said on Facebook. Sounds definitive, but a report from Reuters raises hope that he's OK. "He looks alive and well to me as far as I can tell," says Brent Stapelkamp, field researcher for the Hwange Lion Research Project, which has been monitoring Jericho via GPS. When Stapelkamp heard the news that Jericho was dead, he checked the computer and found that the lion's movements looked fine. In fact, the lion's collar "sent a GPS point" hours after the animal was supposedly killed. It may take a while to straighten out the confusion. (Meanwhile, Zimbabwe hopes to have Cecil's American killer extradited to face charges.)
Summary: There is conflicting information about the fate of Cecil the lion's brother, Jericho, with some sources reporting he was killed by an illegal hunter and others saying he is alive and well.
Story: – A 17-year-old boy has been suspended from school thanks to a phone call to his congressman about gun control. Noah Christensen, a junior at Robert McQueen High School in Reno, Nev., called Rep. Mark Amodei's office during the 17-minute school walkout to protest gun violence earlier this month. He expressed his opinion that bump stocks should be banned and the minimum age to purchase a gun should be increased—and that, as he told the staffer who answered the phone, members of Congress should "get off their f---ing asses" to do so. A Congressional aide called Christensen's school to inform the administration of his language, and the teen was hit with a two-day suspension for "disrespectful behavior/language," CNN reports. He's also being kept from his duties as his class's elected secretary-treasurer, the Nevada Independent reports. Now the ACLU is involved in the case. Christensen's supporters say he was exercising his right to free speech and that Amodei should apologize—but the Republican rep says his aide, as well, was simply exercising his own First Amendment rights by reporting Christensen, and that he won't apologize. The student acknowledges "that's not maybe the wording I should have used but it's still my right to use that word," while his mom says, "I don't encourage my child to go and cuss at someone," but in this case, "maybe somebody does need to get off their butt and do something." The ACLU sent a letter to Amodei criticizing his office for restricting Christensen's constitutional rights, and said in a Monday letter to Christensen's school and the school district that if the punishment is not overturned, it "will have a chilling effect on other students who are considering engaging in the political process." The district says students were expected to "act appropriately and with decorum" during the walkout.
Summary: A 17-year-old boy was suspended from school for two days after he called his congressman's office during a walkout to protest gun violence and used strong language to express his opinion, with the congressman's office reporting him for disrespectful behavior and the ACLU intervening to defend the student's right to free speech.
Story: – The Patriot Act doesn't actually authorize the government's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records, a federal appeals court ruled today. A three-judge panel of the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court, which had thrown out the case, had erred in ruling that the post-9/11 phone records collection by the NSA was legal, as the current and previous administrations have maintained. However, the AP reports the 2nd Circuit declined to block the program, saying it is now up to Congress to decide whether and under what conditions it should continue. That will happen soon: The Patriot Act's Section 215 expires June 1, and lawmakers are currently grappling over what to do, with many favoring a reining-in of it. How the court put it in a 97-page decision that the Wall Street Journal frames as "the most significant legal ruling on the program": "The text of (Section 215) cannot bear the weight the government asks us to assign to it, and ... does not authorize the telephone metadata program." The Journal notes that the court did not rule on whether the collection violated the rights of Americans, saying that's a moot point based on its determination that such collection isn't authorized to begin with.
Summary: A federal appeals court ruled that the US government's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records without a warrant is not authorized by the Patriot Act, but declined to block the program, leaving it up to Congress to decide whether to continue it.
Story: – Democratic socialist Julia Salazar overcame intense scrutiny of her personal life to win the Democratic primary for a state Senate seat in Brooklyn while voters throughout the state punished a group of incumbent Democratic legislators they perceived as too friendly to Republicans. Salazar, a 27-year-old first-time candidate, handily defeated 67-year-old eight-term incumbent Sen. Martin Dilan in New York's 18th District on Thursday night, joining the ranks of leftist insurgents nationwide who have knocked out mainstream Democrats. There is no Republican candidate running in the district in the general election, virtually guaranteeing her the seat, the AP reports. Assuming she wins, Salazar would be the first socialist state senator in a century, reports the Cut. In recent weeks, the race became a soap opera as reporters dug into Salazar's background. She faced criticism for saying she was an immigrant from Colombia who struggled financially growing up when she was actually born in Florida and had hundreds of thousands of dollars in a trust fund. Her victory came on a night when primary voters also took their revenge on a splinter group of Democratic state senators who broke with the party to join a group that supported Republican control of the chamber. Despite a political deal earlier this year to end the schism, six of the eight members of the now-defunct Independent Democratic Conference were ousted in party primaries Thursday. (Gov. Andrew Cuomo fended off a Democratic primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon.)
Summary: Julia Salazar, a 27-year-old democratic socialist, handily defeated an 8-term incumbent state senator in New York's 18th District, virtually guaranteeing her the seat in the general election, despite intense scrutiny of her personal life and a broader trend of primary voters punishing incumbent Democrats who were seen as too friendly to Republicans.
Story: – Private investigators hired by the family of Canadian billionaires Barry and Honey Sherman believe the couple were murdered by multiple killers in December, and did not die as the result of a murder-suicide, CBC reports. The children of the Shermans never believed the murder-suicide theory, releasing a statement after their parents' bodies were found on Dec. 15 that such a theory, which had been forth by a source in the Toronto police, added up to nothing more that "rumors regrettably circulated." In response, the family hired a team of independent investigators, including several former Toronto homicide detectives, to determine what happened to their parents, whose bodies were found hanging by the pool in their Toronto mansion. A source with knowledge of that team's investigation says there are several pieces of evidence pointing in the direction of multiple killers. For one, claims the source, investigators have discovered evidence that both of the victims had their necks wrapped with leather belts. Those belts were then tied to a handrail. In addition, there is evidence that the couple was bound together at the wrists at some point, though no rope or wire was found on the crime scene, reports the International Business Times. The team has also come to believe that Barry and Honey were killed two days before their bodies were found, on Dec. 13, based on the fact the fact that Honey was wearing the same outfit she was in on that day. Investigators also believe Honey Sherman struggled with her killers, as she was found with cuts on her lips and nose.
Summary: Private investigators hired by the Sherman family believe that Barry and Honey Sherman were murdered by multiple killers, with evidence pointing to a staging of the crime scene and signs of a struggle, rather than a murder-suicide as initially reported.
Story: – Two years ago, dozens of academics got together to state that—as the New Yorker puts it—"playing brain games had been shown to improve little more than the ability to play brain games." That declaration surely disappointed many app-loving grandparents, and a new study presented over the weekend may prove it false. The study, which looked at nearly 3,000 seniors over a 10-year period, claims that 11 to 14 hours of "speed training" may reduce the risk of developing dementia a decade later by 48%, the Wall Street Journal reports. It's a result that no other type of brain game—or anything else—has been able to achieve. “If you can reduce the chance of getting dementia by nearly 50% with this, that’s huge,” says an expert at the Cleveland Clinic not involved with the study. Speed training uses a computer program to get people to quickly identify images in the center of their field of vision and match them with images on the periphery. Researchers can't explain how a few hours of training can have such a profound effect a decade later. Reuters reports it's also unclear if the study, which started with healthy participants, would have the same result with people already at risk for dementia. The study hasn't been peer-reviewed or published yet, but the lead researcher, who recommends speed training starting at age 50, says “the potential to benefit is great and the risks are none to minimal." (Another study claims to have found a delicious way to fight dementia.)
Summary: A new study suggests that 11-14 hours of speed training on a computer program may reduce the risk of developing dementia by 48% over a 10-year period, with no other type of brain game or intervention able to achieve this result.
Story: – A new report from a group of UK medical professionals offers a good reminder to make sure you've taken out your old contact lenses before putting in new ones: A woman who thought she just had cataracts actually had 27 lenses in one of her eyes, NPR reports. Doctors were prepping her for cataract surgery, injecting anesthesia, when they found and removed the lenses. The woman, said to be in her mid-60s, hadn't complained of eye irritation, but she explained after the contacts were removed that "she thought her previous discomfort was just part of old age and dry eye," one specialist trainee ophthalmologist tells Britain's Optometry Today. "When she was seen two weeks after I removed the lenses, she said her eyes felt a lot more comfortable," she adds. The cataract surgery was delayed so that bacteria that had accumulated in part of the eye could clear. The report, published in the British Medical Journal, could offer a warning not only to contact-wearing patients who go long stretches without eye exams, but to optometrists as well, since the clump of lenses hadn't caused an obvious infection. If such an incident did lead to an infection, a person could lose her sight, the specialist trainee warns. In this woman's case, doctors say her "deep-set eyes" could be part of the reason so many contacts—which were bound together by mucus, per Time—could have accumulated without notice.
Summary: A woman in her mid-60s was found to have 27 contact lenses in one of her eyes during cataract surgery, after she had complained of no eye irritation despite wearing them for an extended period of time.
Story: – Like countless others, Jaime Robison found herself playing a part in last summer's Ice Bucket Challenge craze to raise money for ALS. In a video uploaded in July, the California police officer was filmed lifting a 5-gallon pail of ice water and dousing a fellow cop, the Los Angeles Times reports. Some nine months later, Robison, 39, is feeling the heat. The Pasadena Police Department officer was actually on disability for a lower back injury at the time of the video—and her ease with the bucket raised the suspicions of investigators, who have since charged her with four counts of insurance fraud. Not only do investigators believe Robison exaggerated her injuries to collect disability benefits from May 31 to August 21, they say that was perhaps the officer's second offense, the San Gabriel Valley Tribune reports. Prosecutors allege she also inflated an injury in 2012, which allowed her to collect disability pay for more than a year. She collected an estimated $117,000 over the two periods in question. Robison, who has been on administrative leave since September, pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday; she faces as many as six years and four months in county jail if convicted. She'll return to court June 10. (Here are 10 Ice Bucket Challenge fails.)
Summary: California police officer Jaime Robison was charged with insurance fraud after participating in the Ice Bucket Challenge while on disability for a lower back injury, with prosecutors alleging she exaggerated her injuries to collect $117,000 in disability benefits over two periods.
Story: – President Obama was apparently perusing Facebook yesterday when he came across a post and was so moved, he decided to leave a comment. It's now getting plenty of attention. It appears on the Humans of New York page created by photographer Brandon Stanton, who posts photos of people he interviews around New York City—and, occasionally, beyond, reports Time. Stanton is currently visiting Iran and yesterday posted a photo of an Iranian 10-year-old and his father. In the photo's caption, the boy's father describes his son's charitable nature: Once, when his son was 5, he asked the boy to carry home a two-pound bag of apricots they'd bought. Before they reached home, however, the man turned around to find his son had given all the fruit away. "I knew then that I was raising a humanitarian," the man says. In a comment from the White House—liked 117,000 times and signed with the president's initials—Obama writes: "What an inspirational story. One of the most fulfilling things that can happen to you as a parent is to see the values you’ve worked to instill in your kids start to manifest themselves in their actions—and this one really resonated with me. I hope this young man never loses his desire to help others. And I’m going to continue doing whatever I can to make this world a place where he and every young person like him can live up to their full potential. (And if I ever get to meet him, I hope he’ll save me an apricot!)" Given the context of the Iranian nuclear deal and Obama's mention of possibly meeting the boy, a blogger at Vox finds the post particularly "meaningful." (Hillary Clinton is also a fan of HONY.)
Summary: President Obama left a comment on a Humans of New York post about an Iranian 10-year-old boy who gave away a two-pound bag of apricots he was carrying, with the president praising the boy's charitable nature and expressing his hope to continue supporting him and other young people in making the world a better place.
Story: – You'd figure a typical Roman gladiator to be a real meat-and-potatoes guy, right? You'd be figuring wrong—at least if you were talking about gladiators from the city of Ephesus. Anthropologists have found that bones uncovered from a gladiator graveyard in the ancient city (once the capital of the Roman province of Asia, in what's now Turkey) reveal a mainly beans-and-grain diet, with nary a giant chicken leg to be found, Phys.org reports. The warriors also indulged in an interesting beverage: a drink made of plant ashes that was supposed to "fortify the body after physical exertion and … promote better bone healing," according to the lead writer of the study published in PLoS One. Scientists used spectroscopy to measure the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur levels in the gladiators' bones, as well as the ratio of strontium (a chemical element that's found in ash) to calcium. Their diet was apparently not so different from that of the general population, the researchers say, but reports at the time referred to gladiators as "hordearii," or "barley eaters," possibly meaning that they ate lower-quality grain than other people. And as for the ash tonic? "Things were similar then to what we do today—we take magnesium and calcium (in the form of effervescent tablets, for example) following physical exertion," the study leader notes. (See how tough the rest of the gladiators' daily life was.)
Summary: Gladiators from the city of Ephesus in ancient Rome had a mainly plant-based diet, consisting of beans and grains, with an interesting beverage made of plant ashes to promote bone healing and physical exertion, despite popular beliefs of a meat-based diet.
Story: – Already under fire for its user data scandal, Facebook is facing new allegations on the misuse of customer data that veer into the cyberstalking realm. It started on Sunday with a tweet from Jackie Stokes, head of the Spyglass Security computer security firm: "I've been made aware that a security engineer currently employed at Facebook is likely using privileged access to stalk women online. I have Tinder logs. What should I do with this information?" Motherboard reports the company is now checking out her claim (Stokes confirmed "multiple senior Facebook employees" had contacted her), though a Facebook rep wouldn't offer details on the alleged worker. Per the Wrap, Stokes says she confirmed the so-called stalker was a Facebook staffer with some online detective work, and she posted a screenshot of the exchange between the sender and recipient. After the message's sender jokes about being a "professional stalker," the recipient replies: "Is that what you're currently doing? Trying to internet stalk me?" Stokes notes she only posted part of the correspondence. The Facebook rep tells Motherboard the company has "strict technical controls and policies" and that "designated employees are only allowed to access the amount of information that's necessary to carry out their job responsibilities." Whoever's involved in this alleged incident, the company appears ready to take action. "We have a zero-tolerance approach to abuse, and improper behavior results in termination," the Facebook rep adds. CNET notes these allegations call to mind ones in 2014 against an Uber executive who was accused of using the platform's "God View" feature to spy on a BuzzFeed reporter.
Summary: A security engineer at Facebook is accused of using their privileged access to stalk women online, with evidence provided by a security firm, and the company is investigating the matter despite declining to provide details on the alleged worker.
Story: – Saudi Arabia is moving to firm up alliances with Sunni nations in a bid to limit Iran’s influence and stem the tide of revolts in the Arab world. It has asked several countries across the Middle East and Asia, including Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia, to join an informal alliance that will oppose Iran and stifle the Shiite revolt in Bahrain, the Wall Street Journal reports. In his pitch to Pakistan, Prince Bandar bin Sultan al-Saud reportedly argued that America couldn’t be trusted to restore stability. Saudi Arabia has also asked the rulers of Jordan and Morocco to join the country in a kind of “Club of Kings,” Prince Waleed bin Talal al-Saud tells the New York Times. “We’re sending a message that monarchies are not where this is happening,” the prince says. "We are not trying to get our way by force, but to safeguard our interests." Egypt’s military council, meanwhile, has received $4 billion in Saudi aid, and Saudi diplomats are trying to manage the transition of power in Yemen.
Summary: Saudi Arabia is forming an informal alliance with Sunni nations to counter Iran's influence and stem revolts in the Arab world, including asking Pakistan, Malaysia, and Indonesia to join, while also seeking to safeguard its interests through aid and diplomacy in Egypt and Yemen.
Story: – For more than two months, a 13-year-old in India took part in an extreme religious fast, reports the BBC. Early this month she called off that fast, but she fell into a coma two days later and died of cardiac arrest on Oct. 4—and now her parents, well-off jewelers in Hyderabad, and other family members have been charged with homicide, cops tell AFP. Aradhana Samdariya's relatives insist she chose to embark on the 68-day fast of her own volition as part of a ritual in Jainism, an ancient Indian religion that believes "the way to liberation and bliss is to live lives of harmlessness and renunciation" and whose foundation lies in the "concern for the welfare of every being in the universe." But others, including the children's rights group that filed the complaint against Aradhana's family, say the young teen was coerced, perhaps in the misguided belief it would make her father's business more profitable. Aradhana's grandfather notes it's not the first time the girl had fasted: He says she had pulled off an eight-day fast and a 34-day fast, and so was determined to go even longer this time, partly because she was interested in becoming a nun, per the Deccan Chronicle. But a local NGO says the dad's business was faltering and the family's guru suggested having Aradhana fast for good luck. The BBC and AFP note she lived on nothing but boiled water during her fast, while others, such as Firstpost.com, say not even sips of water are permitted during the most extreme version of Jain fasting. Psychologists say that children are especially vulnerable to the guilt that may lure them into such dangerous practices. "The child is made to believe it is for the good of the family," one expert says. "What is sacrificed is the health of the minor." (Fasting helped lead to disaster at an Arizona sweat lodge.)
Summary: A 13-year-old Indian girl died after a 68-day fast in an extreme religious ritual, with her family and guru charged with homicide, amid concerns of coercion and exploitation in the practice of Jainism.
Story: – Sen. John McCain says Russia is "testing" President Trump by deploying an operational cruise missile in violation of a Cold War-era nuclear treaty. Officials tell the New York Times that Russia has two battalions of the cruise missile inside the country—one at an operational base and another at a test site at Kapustin Yar—which is banned under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by the US and Russia in 1987. Russia—accused by the Obama administration of testing said missile in 2014—has tried to escape the agreement in recent years, with Vladimir Putin claiming in 2013 that "nearly all of our neighbors are developing these kinds of weapons systems." However, it has denied any violations and accused the US of its own breaches. A NATO official says non-compliance with the treaty banning ground-launched intermediate-range and short-range missiles "is a serious concern for the alliance" but "NATO allies have the capabilities in place to ensure that Russia will not gain any military advantage." Still, some—including McCain—are calling for the US to take action by expanding missile defenses in Europe or deploying its own nuclear missiles, per the BBC. The State Department says Russia "remains in violation" of the treaty but has not said how it plans to respond. In recent days, Russia has also placed a spy ship in international waters off Delaware and flown aircraft within 1,000 yards of a US Navy warship in the Black Sea, reports CNN. Russia has denied that the flybys took place.
Summary: Russia has deployed an operational cruise missile in violation of a Cold War-era nuclear treaty, with two battalions stationed at an operational base and a test site, prompting concerns from NATO and calls for US action.
Story: – A Texas physician who caused a stir with comments he made justifying the gender pay gap in a medical journal has apologized. Per the Guardian, Dr. Gary Tigges of Plano made waves when he told the Dallas Medical Journal's “Big and Bright Ideas” section that women choose not to work as hard as men. "They simply don’t want to be rushed, or they don’t want to work the long hours," wrote Tigges, who went on to say that women's priorities lie more with "something else … family, social, whatever.” Tigges said that nothing needs to be done to address the issue, putting the onus instead on the women themselves who he said would be paid more if they chose to work harder. A social media firestorm erupted with Tigges at the center and he has since released a lengthy statement of apology. "I have heard from several trusted female physician colleagues who disagree with and are deeply hurt and offended," Tigges wrote in the statement obtained by CBS News. "I now understand more clearly how intricate this issue is and that there are ways we can work together to resolve these disparities." Tigges also apologized to "female physicians" in general and to his colleagues at Plano Internal Medicine Associates.
Summary: Dr. Gary Tigges, a Texas physician, sparked controversy by suggesting in a medical journal that the gender pay gap is due to women's choices, rather than systemic inequality, and has since apologized to female physicians and colleagues after facing backlash on social media.
Story: – Spotify has put an end to a small band's ingenious plan to milk it for money with a silent album—but not before that album racked up a five-figure royalty check. In case you missed it, last month a band called Vulfpeck created a silent album called "Sleepify," and urged fans to play it on repeat all night while they slept. The band only has about a thousand fans, but they were able to not-listen hard enough to earn the band $20,000 in royalties, Gawker reports. Spotify ended the party a few weeks ago—which Vulfpeck revealed in a gimmick three-track EP. Spotify told him that "while they enjoy Sleepify and thought it was funny and clever, it violated their terms of content," frontman Jack Stratton said in a spoken track called "#Hurt." The next track is 30 seconds of silence. Stratton tells Vice that Spotify hasn't paid up yet, but he assumes it will, and he's not worried about any repercussions from the stunt. "You have to be practicing yoga and eating grass-fed butter to face the coldness of the free market," he says.
Summary: Vulfpeck, a small band, earned $20,000 in royalties from Spotify by releasing a silent album called "Sleepify" and encouraging fans to play it on repeat while they slept, but Spotify ended the stunt and has yet to pay the band.
Story: – An Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur has come forward to reveal himself as the long-unidentified founder of Bitcoin. For those who follow such things, the name will be familiar: It's Craig Wright, the man Wired magazine identified as the all-but-certain creator of the digital currency last year. Now Wright himself has given interviews to the BBC, the Economist, and GQ to say that he is indeed the man behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright also posted a blog entry with technical details to buttress his claim, one that will surely be pored over in the coming days. "Satoshi is dead," he writes. The Economist's takeaway: "Our conclusion is that Mr. Wright could well be Mr. Nakamoto, but that important questions remain. Indeed, it may never be possible to establish beyond reasonable doubt who really created Bitcoin." Wright says he's come forward now to end the speculation—"there are lots of stories out there that have been made up and I don't like it hurting those people I care about," he tells the BBC—but he says he isn't interested in being the "public face" of Bitcoin. "I just want to be left alone." The revelation comes at a pivotal time for the currency, as two competing camps within the community wrestle with whether it should remain "smallish and pure" or go more mainstream, says the Economist. Wright says he chose the fictional name Nakamoto after a 17th-century philosopher and merchant in Japan. As for the name Satoshi, "some things should remain secret." If he is indeed Nakamoto, Wright is a wealthy man, because "Nakamoto" holds the equivalent of about $450 million in Bitcoins. Still, GQ notes that the revelation also puts Wright in danger of prosecution, given the use of Bitcoin in the Internet's shadowy realms such as the Silk Road.
Summary: Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist and entrepreneur, has revealed himself as the creator of Bitcoin, using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, after previously remaining anonymous for years, and has provided technical details to support his claim, but important questions remain and he is not interested in being the public face of Bitcoin.
Story: – Dominique Strauss-Kahn could be released on bail tomorrow if a judge accepts a new deal, and his attorneys think he has a decent shot. The IMF chief would post $1 million and agree to stay at his Manhattan residence while wearing an electronic bracelet and under the watch of a private security firm, report CNN and ABC News. A hearing is set for tomorrow afternoon. Meanwhile, the 32-year-old maid he is accused of raping testified before a grand jury today. "I want her to feel safe," says her attorney of DSK's possible bail arrangement. "To the extent that his freedom would impair her feeling of safety, that would deeply concern me." In another development, investigators cut a swatch of carpet from the hotel room in their hunt for forensic evidence. Click to read about DSK being put under a suicide watch at Rikers.
Summary: Dominique Strauss-Kahn could be released on bail tomorrow if a judge accepts a new deal, which would require him to post $1 million and agree to stay at his Manhattan residence while wearing an electronic bracelet and under the watch of a private security firm.
Story: – A rattlesnake had its head shot off only to go after its executioner an hour later, as seen in a wild video making the rounds on social media. Billy Forbus of Montgomery, Ala., tells WSFA he shot the snake, separating its head from the body, after finding it in his garden, then put the body in his truck bed. But when he returned an hour later with a grabber tool, hoping to show the reptile to his dad and brother, he found the snake was acting far from dead. The video shows it slithering away before suddenly striking out, knocking the tool out of Forbus' hand. "We pretty much decided to just to leave him alone after that," Forbus says. "That thing had no head, and anywhere I walked around this truck and touched him, he knew where I was coming from." Forbus should perhaps consider himself lucky. Last month, a Texas man needed 26 doses of antivenom, and still nearly died, after he was bit by the head of a rattlesnake he'd decapitated with a shovel, per Global News. This sort of thing actually happens pretty often as snakes retain their bite reflexes hours after death, per National Geographic. "It comes down to them being cold-blooded," a wildlife expert tells WSFA. "They don't really need that much oxygen to begin with so that energy can stay … longer in them than it would us." That applies to a snake's venom glands, as well as the rest of its body, even when decapitated. "The other half continues to work. It'll rise and rattle" a researcher tells Gizmodo, explaining Forbus' experience. (This snake "hit the jackpot" with its venom.)
Summary: A man in Alabama found a rattlesnake in his garden, shot it, and an hour later, the snake's headless body struck out and bit him, highlighting the fact that decapitated snakes can still retain their bite reflexes for hours due to their cold-blooded nature and the continued functioning of their venom glands.
Story: – Amid the furor over concussions in the NFL, a new study finds that players are at a higher risk for the injuries during games played when it's colder out. Researchers looked at injury report data from all 32 NFL teams for the 2012-13 and the 2013-14 regular seasons, and found that during games played in temperatures of 50 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, players had double the risk of concussions compared to those in games played at around 70 degrees or warmer. There was also a 1.5 times higher risk of ankle injuries in the colder games, and a 1.36 times higher rate of shoulder injuries for players in games on natural grass (as opposed to synthetic turf), UPI reports. The Canadian researchers say this is the first study to show such a link with the weather, notes the Toronto Globe and Mail. The study did not identify why the higher risk exists, but "at colder temperatures, materials and equipment in the playing environment have a lower elastic potential, and that may increase the impact forces that are transmitted during the game and increase forces to the head," the lead author says. It's also possible that concussions are simply under-reported for games at warmer temperatures, since players might incorrectly believe they are simply dehydrated or overheated. During colder games, athletic staff might be more quick to realize concussion symptoms, because they are interacting with players more often to keep them warm on the sidelines. As for the ankle injuries, the lead author says it's possible bodily reflexes don't work as well in the cold, making injuries more likely. (A new report on the NFL's concussion research is quite damning.)
Summary: In a new study, researchers found that NFL players are at a higher risk of concussions, ankle injuries, and shoulder injuries when playing in cold temperatures, with a 2x higher risk of concussions, 1.5x higher risk of ankle injuries, and 1.36x higher risk of shoulder injuries in games played at 50°F or lower compared to warmer temperatures.
Story: – Disney looks poised for another fairy-tale success with Frozen, a tale of two sisters based on Hans Christian Andersen's "The Snow Queen." In the first Disney animated feature co-directed by a woman, Jennifer Lee, filmmakers appear to have their sights set on Broadway, reviewers note. The movie's "gleaming dream world of snow and ice is one of the most visually captivating environments to be found in a Disney animated film," writes Stephen Holden in the New York Times, though he notes that the film "is not fundamentally revolutionary." The music, however, "comes closer than any score for a Disney animated film to capturing the charm of the Alan Menken-Howard Ashman collaboration in its glory days." In the Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy calls the film "energetic, humorous, and not too cloying," noting that "visually, Frozen is a pleasure," with "good, unforced use of 3D." It's also "shrewdly calculated down to the smallest detail in terms of its appeal factor." But at RogerEbert.com, Christy Lemire sees Frozen as wanting "to enliven and subvert the conventions of typical Disney princess movies while simultaneously remaining true to their aesthetic trappings for maximum merchandising potential." It "encourages young women to support and stay loyal to each other ... as long as some hunky potential suitors and adorable, wise-cracking creatures also are around to complete them." At Ain't It Cool News, Nordling feels differently. Sisters Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell) show "a self-sufficiency and a spirit that goes beyond the normal tropes to create something wonderful for an entire new generation of little girls and women alike ... For Elsa and Anna, happily ever after is something worked for, not something given."
Summary: Disney's Frozen is an animated film that has received positive reviews for its visually captivating environment, catchy music, and strong female characters, with some critics noting that it subverts typical Disney princess movie conventions while still embracing them for maximum merchandising potential.
Story: – The business manager who stole millions from Alanis Morissette is going to prison. A judge in Los Angeles sentenced Jonathan Schwartz on Wednesday to six years, longer than prosecutors had sought, reports the AP. "I will spend the rest of my life asking for forgiveness," said Schwartz, who embezzled $5 million from Morissette and another $2 million from other clients while at GSO Business Management. The Canadian singer appeared at the sentencing, telling the judge that Schwartz "did this in a long, systematic, drawn-out, and sinister manner," and would have bankrupted her within another three years had the theft not been discovered in 2014. Schwartz also was ordered to pay $8.6 million in restitution. Morissette and the other bilked clients have gotten their money back through insurance or GSO, notes CNN. Schwartz previously wrote an open letter published in the Hollywood Reporter apologizing and blaming an addiction to gambling. "He had us all fooled," said Morissette. Prosecutors sought about five years, but the judge added one more because of the "sheer audaciousness" of Schwartz's stealing. (The singer got another bad break when thieves stole about $2 million in valuables from a safe.)
Summary: Jonathan Schwartz, the business manager who embezzled $7 million from Alanis Morissette and other clients, was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to pay $8.6 million in restitution.
Story: – There’s nothing to suggest that John Boehner has changed his mind since the last time he said he doesn’t want to impeach the president—but that didn’t stop a senior White House aide this morning from saying he thinks the door for Republicans to make that happen is still more than slightly ajar. Speaking at the Christian Science Monitor journalism forum this morning, Dan Pfeiffer warned reporters that the health care lawsuit initiated by the House speaker against Obama was a catalyst for impeachment-happy Republicans, according to the Huffington Post. Pfeiffer’s reactions came one day after a House panel voted to authorize Boehner's lawsuit, a move that former Republican VP candidate Paul Ryan tells MSNBC is necessary to harness the "lawlessness of the [Obama] administration." At this morning's breakfast, the White House aide cited a rabble-rousing Sarah Palin, a CNN poll released today showing 57% of GOPers in favor of impeachment, and the ongoing border immigration crisis as his main reasons for believing that an impeachment filing is a nearly done deal. Boehner’s spokesman emailed an official sigh-and-eyeroll to Pfeiffer this morning about the administration’s "inattention" to the immigrant influx and the "mixed signals" from Pfeiffer's breakfast banter, stating, "It is telling, and sad, that a senior White House official is focused on political games … rather than helping these kids and securing the border."
Summary: Senior White House aide Dan Pfeiffer warned reporters that the House speaker's lawsuit against President Obama could lead to impeachment among Republicans, citing recent polls and the ongoing border immigration crisis.
Story: – Looks like Aaron Hernandez's home surveillance system may have backfired on him. Photos have emerged showing the former football star carrying a gun shortly after the shooting of Odin Lloyd, prosecutors say. "Interior surveillance footage shows Aaron Hernandez pass through the living room area of the residence while holding an item, identified by investigators being consistent with a firearm," says an affidavit, per ABC News. The images exist despite Hernandez tampering with the 14-camera surveillance system, prosecutors say. Meanwhile, a clearer story of the night is emerging: Hernandez sent a text to Lloyd hours before he was killed that read: "I'm coming to grab that tonight. U gon b around I need dat and we could step for a little again." A gas station security camera shows Hernandez filling a silver sedan; that sedan was later caught pulling into the industrial park where the murder happened, an affidavit says. "This vehicle entered the crime scene at 3:23am on Monday, June 17, 2013." The timing "is consistent with the reports of employees at an adjacent business who heard gunshots." The home surveillance footage is from 10 minutes later, according to police. Police found a Hungarian rifle and 33-round magazine at Hernandez's home; the AK-47-like gun carried Hernandez's palm print, the Boston Herald reports. Lloyd was found with the keys to a vehicle Hernandez had rented. When police went to Hernandez's home to question him, he initially slammed the door; then he agreed to an interview at the police station.
Summary: Aaron Hernandez's home surveillance system captured him carrying a gun into his residence shortly before the shooting of Odin Lloyd, despite his attempts to tamper with the system, and police found a Hungarian rifle and AK-47-like gun with Hernandez's palm print at his home, along with a text message sent by Hernandez to Lloyd hours before the murder that read "Im coming to grab that tonight. U gon b around I need dat and we could step for a little again."
Story: – In the strange-lawsuits department comes this from Texas: A woman is suing Chick-fil-A because she says one of the chain's cherry-topped milkshakes gave her a heart attack, reports the Houston Chronicle. Cyndi Scruggs purchased the shake from a location in McKinney, near Plano, on May 10. But when she put the maraschino cherry into her mouth, she discovered that it had not been "properly de-pitted," as the legalese of her petition states. When Scruggs chomped down on the pit, she fractured two teeth below the gumline. That led to gum infection and sepsis, which in turn led to a heart attack, according to her lawsuit. Scruggs, who has since moved to Colorado, is suing both the chain and its cherry supplier (Dell's Maraschino Cherries Co. Inc. in New York) for between $200,000 and $1 million to cover medical expenses, "physical pain, disfigurement, impairment, and mental anguish," reports the Dallas Observer. (A Nebraska man in 2013 sued Walmart, claiming one of its plastic bags ultimately led to his wife's death.)
Summary: A woman in Texas is suing Chick-fil-A and its cherry supplier for $200,000 to $1 million after she fractured two teeth and suffered a heart attack when a maraschino cherry pit got stuck in her mouth.
Story: – Michael Moore has been a busy man lately, taking on the Flint water crisis, promoting his upcoming movie Where to Invade Next, and even stumping for Bernie Sanders. But there's been a temporary setback: The filmmaker has been in the ICU with pneumonia since Sunday night, the Detroit Free Press reports. Moore first announced this development on Twitter Thursday, following that up with a long Facebook post Friday morning in which he wrote: "I read somewhere you can't burn it at both ends, and if u do, it's best not to do so in the winter nor anywhere near a place full of toxic water!" Moore also makes on Facebook what he calls an "unorthodox" request, one he has never seen "made before by a director (then again, I could just be on the wrong drugs)": to gather a "quickly cobbled-together 'army' of grassroots foot soldiers" (i.e., his fans) to help him promote his movie by sharing the trailer and reviews, since he's laid up and it's opening in some theaters in just one week. "I can't fly, I have to recover, and in one week (February 12th) this great movie I've put so much of my life into is going to open in theaters—with little or no assistance from me," he explains. Moore adds that he is due to be discharged from the hospital shortly. (Moore has also called for disarming the police.)
Summary: Michael Moore is in the ICU with pneumonia and has asked his fans to help promote his upcoming movie "Where to Invade Next" by sharing the trailer and reviews on social media.
Story: – The Vatican today kicked out a phony bishop who got past security and nearly entered a meeting of cardinals who will pick the next pope, USA Today reports. Identified as Ralph Napierski, a German, the man showed up with an entourage of fake assistants and posed for photographs with an actual cardinal. But there were giveaways: His short cassock, black fedora in lieu of skull cap, and an ordinary purple-pink scarf instead of a sash. Still, Napierski fooled people for about an hour, calling himself Basilius and claiming membership in a Catholic order he invented called Corpus Dei (a riff on the real Opus Dei). His motive is unknown, but Napierski runs a blog about Corpus Dei and another blog called Jesus Yoga, which purports to teach the "hidden techniques of Christian meditation," the International Business Times reports. Now the Vatican is holding talks on how to boost security before the next pope is chosen.
Summary: A man pretending to be a bishop named Basilius nearly gained access to a meeting of cardinals selecting the next pope, but was caught due to his inauthentic attire and claims of belonging to a fictional Catholic order, Corpus Dei.
Story: – Elizabeth Hurley took to Twitter for Round 2 of explanations/denials regarding the breakdown of her marriage. The Mirror reports that rumors started swirling that the model would be moving to Australia to be with cricketer Shane Warne. Hurley cleared up the matter last night, tweeting, "Bored now of silly speculations. No one is divorcing anyone yet, no one is fighting over money, and I have no plans to go to Australia. Enough!" (Click for more on why so many celebs are splitting up these days.)
Summary: Elizabeth Hurley denied rumors of a marriage breakdown and plans to move to Australia with cricketer Shane Warne, clarifying that no divorce or money disputes are happening and she has no plans to relocate.
Story: – Lefties everywhere like to accuse the Koch brothers of everything from buying elections to plotting world domination, but a report by Courthouse News picked up by Huffington Post outlines a truly bizarre accusation involving lesser-known Koch brother, Bill. Seems Bill Koch—the twin of David Koch and younger brother of Charles Koch who left the family business after a lengthy legal battle—stands accused of imprisoning an exec at his own Oxbow Corporation. Kirby Martensen has filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Bill Koch lured him to his remote Aspen ranch, interrogated him at length, and held him against his will. Martensen says an anonymous letter accusing him of defrauding Oxbow prompted the company to review his email, which revealed his skepticism at what the HuffPo calls the company's "tax avoidance strategies." He describes the ordeal at Koch's ranch in length, then says he was fired and forced to fly to San Francisco aboard a private plane with a man he believed was armed (perhaps not coincidentally, he's suing in not-very-Koch-friendly San Fran). A Koch rep confirms they investigated and fired Martensen, and says Oxbow is "pursuing appropriate action." Bill Koch, perhaps best known for bankrolling the boat that won the 1992 America's Cup, is the only defendant in Martensen's lawsuit.
Summary: Bill Koch, the lesser-known Koch brother, is accused of imprisoning an executive at his ranch in Aspen, Colorado, and holding him against his will, according to a federal lawsuit filed by the executive.
Story: – The Secret Service's motto is "Worthy of Trust and Confidence." A new report from USA Today suggests agents might want to petition for the addition of "and Being Paid in Full" to the end of that. The agency's director tells the paper that more than 1,000 agents have already logged all the work and overtime hours they're permitted for 2017. The related payment cap is set at $160,000 per year, and Director Randolph Alles is trying to get Congress to bump that to $187,000. A trio of points: He says if that doesn't happen, agents won't be paid for some of the hours they've already put in; even if it does, roughly 130 agents still won't get full compensation; the size of the Trump family is part of the reason for the issue. "The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,'' Alles tells the paper, which describes him as saying the number of White House protectees—42—has never been so high. Under former President Obama, it was 31; of the current 42, 18 are President Trump's family members. The timing of the revelation isn't great: September will see world leaders gather in NYC for the United Nations General Assembly, an event that requires very heavy Secret Service protection. The lawmakers' quotes in the story suggest they're determined to rectify the situation. Read the full USA Today article, which outlines recent Secret Service expenditures, including $60,000 in golf cart rentals at two Trump properties.
Summary: The Secret Service is seeking a pay raise for its agents, who have already worked over 1,000 hours of overtime in 2017 without being paid, due to a payment cap set at $160,000 per year, with Director Randolph Alles hoping to raise it to $187,000 to accommodate the large Trump family and increased protection needs for upcoming events, including the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Story: – Red wine may help fight cancer, but it may also help bring about the disease if you don't watch your intake and diet. Scientists tested 65 US wines and found all but one contained arsenic in levels that exceed the 10 parts per billion permitted in drinking water, according to a release. The samples from wines out of California, Washington, New York, and Oregon contained an average of 24 parts per billion, though some samples contained 76 parts; Oregon's wines had the lowest levels, averaging 13 parts. Time to freak out? Not necessarily. Even frequent drinkers would only get about 12% of the recommended maximum daily arsenic intake from wine, lead author Denise Wilson says. But if you consume a lot of foods high in arsenic, like apple juice, rice, seafood, and cereal bars, "you should be concerned, especially pregnant women, kids, and the elderly." Wilson also reviewed arsenic levels in other items and found an adult female who eats a large amount of rice, for instance, would get 101% of the maximum recommended daily dose of arsenic from that source alone. Pair that with a few glasses of wine and you might have a problem; too much arsenic can cause skin, lung, and bladder cancers and other diseases. Wilson says wineries should try to remove arsenic, but "the whole idea that you would sue a winery for having arsenic in their wine is like suing someone for having rocks in their yard," she says. Instead, people should minimize health risks through diet or undergo tests that can detect high arsenic levels. A scary find for infants: Wilson says those who consume large amounts of formula made with organic brown rice syrup could be getting 10 times the maximum daily dose of arsenic. (This cooking tip could get rid of half the arsenic in your rice.)
Summary: While red wine may contain arsenic, the levels are generally low and unlikely to cause health problems for occasional drinkers, but frequent consumption or a diet rich in foods high in arsenic could lead to excessive exposure and increased cancer risk, particularly for pregnant women, children, and the elderly.

Story: – The words "travesty," "outrageous," and "mystifying" feature heavily in editorial columns on a grand jury's decision not to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in the death of Eric Garner, despite the fact that the officer was captured on video using a banned chokehold on the asthmatic man. The decision not to charge Pantaleo with "even New York’s least serious homicide count—criminally negligent homicide—is beyond mystifying," writes the New York Daily News, saying the decision has the "glaring earmarks of a gross miscarriage of justice" and is harder to understand than the equally controversial Ferguson decision. To indict, the grand jury would only have needed to find indications that the officer failed "to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk" of death from using the chokehold. "African American men are being taught a lesson about how this society values, or devalues, our lives," writes Eugene Robinson in a blistering column at the Washington Post, saying that as with Ferguson, he finds it impossible to believe that the result would have been the same if the victim was white. Garner "didn't even fit into the 'young black male' category that defines this nation's most feared and loathed citizens," he writes. "He was an overweight, middle-aged, asthmatic man. Now we're told that the man who killed him did nothing wrong." Garner, he writes, "committed a capital offense: He was the wrong color." The imbalance between Garner's fate "and his supposed infraction, selling loose cigarettes, is grotesque and outrageous," writes the New York Times, describing the incident as "vicious policing" and calling for Pantaleo to be fired. Any police force that tolerates conduct like Pantaleo's needs to be reformed, the NYT writes, and the Justice Department "is right to swiftly investigate what certainly seem like violations of Mr. Garner's civil rights." At Slate, Justin Peters takes a look at New York City's "broken windows" policing policy and concludes that it not only doesn't work, it may have killed Garner. The policy of cracking down hard on minor violations of the law has returned to New York City as the use of stop-and-frisk declines, he writes, but since violent crime is already declining across the country, regardless of policing tactics, he suggests a new NYPD policy: "First, do no harm."
Summary: A grand jury in New York declined to indict NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo for the death of Eric Garner, despite video evidence of the officer using a banned chokehold, with many editorials expressing outrage and mystification at the decision, with some arguing that the result would have been different if the victim was white and calling for police reform and the investigation of civil rights violations.
Story: – An Obama holdover who was temporarily running the Justice Department just got fired by President Trump after an act of defiance. Mere hours after acting attorney general Sally Yates said the department would not defend Trump's refugee executive order in court while she was in charge, Trump made sure that she was no longer in charge. Her announcement was largely symbolic anyway, notes the New York Times, given that nominee Jeff Sessions is expected to assume the office of attorney general in a matter of days, perhaps even Tuesday. In the interim, Yates will be replaced by Dana Boente, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, reports Politico. A White House statement said Yates "has betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States," adding that she is "weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration." Earlier, Yates wrote a memo to Justice Department lawyers, saying they should not defend the order in court because she wasn't convinced it was lawful. (Read it here.) The Senate Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote Tuesday on Sessions, reports the Washington Post. In the meantime, court challenges to Trump's ban have been filed in at least five states, notes CNN: Virginia, New York, Massachusetts, Washington, and California.
Summary: Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was fired by President Trump after she announced the Justice Department would not defend his refugee executive order in court, with Trump criticizing her as "weak on borders" and "very weak on illegal immigration."
Story: – You kids had better respect your moms: In a skyrocketing number of American homes, she's the one putting food on the table as stay-at-home moms become things of the past. Women are now the primary or only income source for 40% of US households with kids, according to a new Pew survey. But that number might not be the cause for celebration it sounds like, because much of that 40% is made up of struggling single moms. About 37% of these "breadwinner moms" are married women who earn more than their husbands, and their families are doing quite well, with a median income of $80,000—well above the national average. But the other 63% are single mothers, with a median family income of just $23,000. One sociologist also tells the Washington Post that the trend may owe something to the disproportionate job losses suffered by men in the great recession. And the public is divided on whether working motherhood is even a good thing, with 51% telling Pew that kids are better off if mom stays home. (Maybe guys feel that way because female breadwinners are more likely to ditch them.)
Summary: According to a Pew survey, 40% of US households with kids have women as the primary or only income source, with single mothers earning a median income of $23,000 compared to $80,000 for married women who earn more than their husbands.
Story: – A Breitbart reporter who claims she was assaulted during a Donald Trump press conference on Tuesday has filed a police report against Trump's campaign manager Friday in Florida, the Independent Journal Review reports. According to Gawker, Michelle Fields claims she was trying to ask Trump a question about affirmative action as he was leaving the press conference when his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabbed her arm hard enough to leave bruises. While Fields says she didn't see who grabbed her, a Washington Post reporter standing nearby says it was Lewandowski, CNN reports. The Jupiter Police Department is investigating her claims as a misdemeanor battery case. Trump says he thinks Fields is making the whole thing up, and Lewandowski went even further. "You are totally delusional," the campaign manager tweets. "I never touched you. As a matter of fact, I have never even met you." Fields' employer, Breitbart, stood by her claims Thursday before hedging its bets as videos of the incident started to make it online Friday. The conservative news source is currently running updates on how likely it is Fields is telling the truth every time a new piece of visual evidence arises. So far, the best video of the incident appears to come from CSPAN. It appears to show Lewandowski reaching across another man toward Fields as she and Trump walk out of frame. You can see a GIF of that moment here.
Summary: A Breitbart reporter, Michelle Fields, filed a police report against Donald Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, for allegedly grabbing her arm and leaving bruises during a press conference, despite Trump and Lewandowski denying the incident and Breitbart initially standing by Fields' claims before hedging its bets as videos of the incident emerged.
Story: – In an accident that was equal parts tragic and freakish, a 4-year-old boy left unattended in an SUV ended up being crushed to death by it. Police in Tulsa, Okla., say the bizarre accident happened when the mother left the boy and his two siblings in her Chevrolet Suburban while she ran inside her home to get some money, the Tulsa World reports. She left the vehicle running, and the boy put it in neutral and jumped out after it rolled back down the driveway into the street and came to a stop, police say. He then ran in front of the vehicle and was fatally crushed when it rolled forward again, pinning him against another car. "When she turned into the driveway, she did not turn the wheel. So when you put a vehicle in neutral, it's going to follow the same track out of the driveway that it did in," a police rep tells KJRH. "It's unbelievable. We're just dumbfounded." The child was given CPR, but he was pronounced dead at a local hospital, and neighbors tell News on 6 that they're devastated by the death of the friendly little boy. Police say the site was processed by a crime scene unit, but they're not planning to press charges over the death. (This 3-year-old boy helped police find his mom's car after it was stolen with him inside.)
Summary: A 4-year-old boy was crushed to death in Tulsa, Oklahoma after he accidentally put a running SUV in neutral and it rolled forward, pinning him against another car, while his mother was inside their home.
Story: – If you've tried explaining net neutrality to your friends only to find their eyes glazing over, appeal to their stomachs instead. Per CNNMoney, Burger King's new "Whopper Neutrality" ad, which debuted Wednesday, illustrates the concept through the lens of Whoppers and wait times. In BK's "social experiment," customers who pay $5 for a Whopper—dubbed the "slow access Whopper pass"—are told they'll be waiting 15 to 20 minutes for their order. If they want to jump in the "fast lane" and make their Whoppers "high priority," they'll have to pony up $13 for the "fast" MBPS ("making burgers per second") or $26 for the "hyperfast" version. "The internet should be like Burger King restaurants, a place that doesn't prioritize and welcomes everyone," a BK marketing rep says in a statement explaining the ad, which comes on the heels of the FCC repeal of net neutrality protections in December. Some call the ad "brilliant" for explaining the complex subject using fast food, but more cynical observers see it as BK capitalizing on a timely topic for its own purposes. Recode, which notes Burger King hasn't exactly been on the front lines until now lobbying for net neutrality repeal (Business Insider backs that up), calls it a "branding exercise" by a "#woke brand" that "[sees] in every social and political cause du jour an opportunity for 15 minutes of web infamy." And Engadget says the ad doesn't even explain the concept all that well (it points to its own explainer instead), though it gives the clip props for its subtle dig at FCC chief Ajit Pai: The BK King is seen at the end drinking out of a giant Reese's mug, as Pai has been known to do. Also at the end of the ad: a link to a Change.org. petition supporting net neutrality. (Montana has become the first state to protect net neutrality.)
Summary: Burger King's new ad campaign, "Whopper Neutrality," uses the analogy of fast food to explain the concept of net neutrality, with customers paying extra for faster service, highlighting the idea that the internet should be accessible to everyone without prioritization.
Story: – The German website Carpooling.com, a smash hit across Europe with millions of users, is readying a launch in the US, reports Fast Company. The web service connects passengers seeking transportation with drivers seeking to save cash who then negotiate a price for a ride. The site has rapidly expanded to 5,000 cities and 45 countries and now has its sights set on the US. "It is going to work," says a company exec. "I don't think the wealth of America is so great they don't need to save money." Carpooling.com generates revenue by taking a portion of each fare, along with charging for extra features. No word yet on when the site will launch here. A handful of other sites are trying to make the idea work in the US as well, including Ridaroo in Philadelphia, notes Fast Company.
Summary: Carpooling.com, a popular European ride-sharing platform, is set to launch in the US, connecting passengers with drivers who negotiate prices for rides, with the company expecting it to be successful due to the potential for cost savings among Americans.
Story: – Three gay men in their late 20s have died from a bacterial meningitis in the Los Angeles area so far this year, with another five people having come down with the illness. Four of the cases involved gay men and three were HIV positive, the Los Angeles Times reports; two of those who died were HIV positive. None of the deceased, who died in February or March, had been in direct contact with each other, the AP notes. "I think the important thing to understand is this is not an epidemic," the medical director of the LA Gay and Lesbian Center says. "But there's a pretty strong signal that men who have sex with men, at least those who are HIV positive, are at increased risk for invasive meningococcal disease." Yesterday's news of the deaths comes almost exactly a year after meningitis—a disease spread by contact with saliva or nose mucus—killed another LA man, and a day after the Department of Public Health urged gay men who are HIV positive, or have multiple partners, to get vaccinated. The county is now offering free vaccinations for those without health insurance. "It's like a bad dream, like a bad deja vu," said a councilman. "Three deaths in three months, it's a lot in one community ... It's a bigger tragedy that they're all young men in their 20s." Of the other five cases, all but one are out of the hospital.
Summary: Four HIV-positive gay men in their late 20s have died from bacterial meningitis in the Los Angeles area this year, with another five cases reported, highlighting an increased risk for men who have sex with men, particularly those who are HIV positive.
Story: – Global warming is just "expensive bulls---t," according to Donald Trump, a position he's often taken publicly, but it looks like he's more than willing to wade in when it comes to one of his own resorts. The last Republican standing has applied for a permit to build a sea wall to protect Trump International Golf Links & Hotel Ireland, his coastal resort in County Clare, and Politico has read it over. The main reason for the wall: an "explicit" reference to global warming via rising sea levels that have led to more erosion and could endanger Trump's property. "It's diabolical," ex-South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis says. "You have a soft place in your heart for people who are honestly ignorant, but people who are deceitful, that's a different thing." Politico notes that Trump acquired the property in 2014 after an unusually harsh winter, and that just days before he closed the deal, another storm hit and tore away 26 feet of land along the water. In the application for the wall—200,000 tons of rocks along a few miles of shore—an environmental impact report was included from an Irish firm, and that analysis went beyond predicting regular wear and tear. "If the predictions of an increase in sea level rise as a result of global warming prove correct … it is likely that there will be a corresponding increase in coastal erosion rates … around much of the coastline of Ireland," it reads. The application also includes a scan of a brochure that the hotel company disseminated to local residents to warn them about the "need for coastal protection." Trump's rep didn't respond to Politico's call; neither did the Trump Organization's general counsel. Meanwhile, Al Gore weighed in Monday on Today, saying, "[Trump] has said some things on the climate crisis that I think should concern everyone." (Politico outlines each time Trump has blasted climate change.)
Summary: Donald Trump has applied for a permit to build a sea wall to protect his coastal resort in Ireland, Trump International Golf Links & Hotel, due to concerns about rising sea levels caused by global warming, despite previously dismissing the issue as "expensive bullshit."
Story: – Google's plan to test ultra-fast Internet speeds via fiber optic networks is going over well with tech bloggers: Mark Sullivan, PC World: "Google hopes that the new model will fire up the business of being a small, local ISP. That can only be good. ... Google has a rare opportunity to put real pressure on large ISPs like AT&T and Comcast to sell more bandwidth for less money." Dan Frommer, Silicon Alley Insider: Cool strategy: "Google makes noise about getting into the telecom business, telcos freak out and spend more money, fast networks get built either way, and Google wins." Mike Masnick, TechDirt: Can Google make this work? "I'd probably bet against it if you were laying odds. ... I'm not convinced that Google will focus enough on this to make it a success. But I hope I'm wrong. More serious entrants into the market would be a good thing." Devindra Hardawar, VentureBeat: "As someone who drools at the thought of a 100 megabit Internet connection, the possibility of a gigabit connection is downright orgasmic. Of course, it won’t make a big difference initially if the rest of the web is stuck at slower speeds, but it offers some killer possibilities down the line."
Summary: Google's plan to test ultra-fast internet speeds via fiber optic networks is gaining attention from tech bloggers, with some expressing optimism about the potential for real pressure on large ISPs and the possibility of faster internet speeds, while others remain skeptical about the feasibility of the project.
Story: – A 22-year-old with dreams of traveling the world has disappeared in the middle of an eight-month backpacking trip through South America and Southeast Asia. Jesse Galganov, who is from Montreal and plans to start medical school in Philadelphia next fall, was last heard from around Sept. 28, when he texted his mom telling her he was about to start hiking the 31-mile Santa Cruz trail through Peru's Cordillera Blanca Mountains and might be unreachable until Oct. 2. But no one has heard from him since, NBC News reports. His friends say he was in touch with them consistently from the start of the trip until Sept. 29, but no one has been able to get a hold of him since then. His mother tells the Toronto Sun authorities are investigating the possibility her son was abducted, and she believes that's what happened. "Nobody really disappears into thin air," she says. The local DA's office is conducting a criminal investigation after inconsistencies were uncovered regarding his stay at the Kame House Backpacker Hostel, with employees giving differing reports of when he arrived and left and the owner initially confirming he had been there, then later saying he had not. Galganov was planning to stay at the hostel the evening of Sept. 28, and security footage shows him leaving a bus station that morning in the direction of the hostel. He later sent a friend a Snapchat from the hostel. There is no record of him registering at the entry point of the trail he was planning to hike, and no other hikers or guides on the popular trail have reported sightings of him. His mother is in Peru trying to retrace her son's steps, and a GoFundMe campaign has been set up to help with costs. She has also started a petition asking Apple, T-Mobile, and Amazon to release information from his iPhone and Kindle that could help investigators.
Summary: A 22-year-old backpacker named Jesse Galganov has gone missing in Peru after last being heard from on September 28, with his mother believing he may have been abducted and authorities investigating inconsistencies in his stay at a hostel and his planned hike.
Story: – The people of Dixon in Illinois thought comptroller Rita Crundwell funded her lavish lifestyle through her successful horse-breeding operation. But investigators say she did it by robbing the small city blind. Crundwell, Dixon's finance chief since the early '80s, has been arrested and accused of embezzling more than $30 million over the last six years alone—more than $2,000 for each of its 15,700 residents, the Wall Street Journal notes. The city, best known as the boyhood home of Ronald Reagan, only has a budget of some $8 million a year. Crundwell spent huge sums on her two horse farms and on luxuries including a $2.1 million top-end mobile home, reports the Chicago Tribune. She was busted after she took a few months off to operate the horse business, and an employee filling in noticed some suspicious bank statements. "I was sick to my stomach, and I kept hoping that there really wasn't anything going on," says Dixon's mayor. The town has suffered through major budget cuts in recent years which Crundwell blamed on the state. Residents say the public pool has been closed for the last few summers, and several other services have been cut back.
Summary: Comptroller Rita Crundwell of Dixon, Illinois embezzled over $30 million from the small city over six years, using the funds to support her lavish lifestyle, including two horse farms and luxury items, while the city suffered from budget cuts and reduced services for its 15,700 residents.
Story: – It’s been dubbed "music for aliens," but the Voyager golden record, sent into space on NASA's Voyager 1 and 2 in 1977, was as much "a gift to humanity" as it was "a gift from humanity to the cosmos," per a Kickstarter campaign. In a project overseen by astronomer Carl Sagan, the gold records were filled with sounds from Earth, including music from Bach and Chuck Berry, sounds of nature, and greetings in 55 languages, reports Pitchfork. But most humans never got a chance to listen. Two copies are now in deep space with the Voyager crafts, one was reserved for Jimmy Carter, and a handful of others were distributed to NASA centers, reports the New York Times. Sagan himself couldn't even get one. As the 40th anniversary approaches, however, Ozma Records hopes to raise $198,000 to release vinyl copies. It looks poised to meet that goal. With 28 days left in its Kickstarter campaign, it has already raised $155,000 from more than 1,300 backers as Thursday. Those who donate $98 are promised a "Voyager Golden Record Box Set," complete with three vinyl LPs in a cloth-covered box with gold foil inlay and a full-color book of images. Digital downloads are also available for $25. "It is as relevant now as it was in 1977. Perhaps even more so," says Boing Boing editor David Pescovitz, who's teamed up with Amoeba Music's Timothy Daly and graphic designer Lawrence Azerrad to produce the records. "Our hope is that this release … will provoke questions about our place in the universe, open our minds to possibility, and serve as a reminder that the future is really up to all of us." (A tiny toy is one of Kickstarter's most lucrative projects ever.)
Summary: A Kickstarter campaign aims to release vinyl copies of the Voyager golden record, a 1977 NASA project overseen by Carl Sagan that includes sounds from Earth, such as music and nature sounds, and greetings in 55 languages, with the goal of provoking questions about humanity's place in the universe and open minds to possibility.
Story: – Comcast is reviving the idea of Internet data caps, and intends to roll them out to all of its customers in the coming years. At a conference yesterday, Executive VP David Cohen said he envisioned implementing "a usage-based billing model" for everyone within five years. Customers would have to pay a fee if they used too much bandwidth in a month—though Cohen said the cap might be as high as 350 gigabytes or even 500 gigabytes, CNN reports. Cohen added that Comcast would likely keep increasing that cap over time. "We will always want to say the basic level of usage at a sufficiently high level that the vast majority of our customers are not implicated," he said. Comcast is already experimenting with 300-gigabyte caps in some markets, which it once told Ars Technica affect only 2% of users. Basically the move is a shot across the bow at cord cutters, observes Amadou Diallo at Forbes. Comcast "could essentially say, 'Want to drop our TV service? Go ahead. But it’s going to cost you.'"
Summary: Comcast is planning to introduce usage-based billing for all customers in the next five years, starting with an initial cap of 300-500 gigabytes, with the goal of gradually increasing the cap over time to target cord cutters and discourage them from dropping its TV service.
Story: – Alex Rodriguez will likely receive his punishment tomorrow: a suspension through the 2014 season, sources tell USA Today and ESPN. MLB and A-Rod's lawyers were said to he hammering out a settlement, but sources tell ESPN that talks broke down yesterday when commissioner Bud Selig refused to negotiate with the Yankees, and A-Rod pissed him off by telling the media he wouldn't negotiate at all. MLB reportedly offered him a deal to take lifetime bans off the table if he would agree to potentially being suspended for more than 50 games. A-Rod's camp "unequivocally" turned the offer down, says ESPN. Now he's apparently looking at a 215-game ban—the longest ever since Pete Rose's 1988 lifetime ban, according to USA Today. A-Rod is expected to appeal the reported suspension, and MLB is also expected to refuse to let him play while he appeals. "If this goes to arbitration, it could get very, very ugly," a source tells ESPN. USA Today reports that A-Rod plans to immediately file an appeal to let him at least play against the White Sox tomorrow. He is expected to fly to Chicago tonight, and the Yankees' manager says he has penciled the star in on the lineup. About 12 other players are also expected to be suspended tomorrow.
Summary: Alex Rodriguez is expected to be suspended for 215 games, the longest suspension in MLB history, after he and MLB were unable to come to a settlement on a punishment for his role in the Biogenesis scandal, with A-Rod's camp rejecting a deal that would have removed lifetime bans off the table and MLB expected to refuse to let him play while he appeals.
Story: – An employee at a Philly mosque stumbled upon a gruesome discovery Monday morning: a severed pig's head lying near the building's front door, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Per USA Today, surveillance video shows a red pickup truck cruising slowly by the Al-Aqsa Islamic Society building Sunday night, then making another pass to fling the pig's head out a window. "It is a heinous act that sends a message to Arab American communities that they are not wanted here in Philadelphia, and that could not be further from the truth," the head of the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations tells USA Today. The commission, cops, and the FBI are said to be investigating, and although the truck's license plate is difficult to read in the video, authorities say they may be able to enhance the visuals, the Inquirer notes. Local leaders say hostility toward Muslims has intensified since the Paris attacks and San Bernardino shooting, bolstered by what the Inquirer calls the "anti-immigrant rhetoric of some politicians." (Donald Trump's call to keep all Muslims from entering the US could fall under this umbrella.) The mosque's caretaker, for instance, says the day after the Paris massacre, an anonymous caller left a voicemail that called Allah "a piece of pork s---." "There's a constant climate of insinuation of terrorism and disloyalty that creates this pervasive sense of being an outsider," a fellow at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding tells the Washington Post. Backlash against Muslims is "worse now than it was after 9/11," the head of the city's Arab American Development Corp. tells the Inquirer. "[Sept. 11] was a horrible incident, but we didn't have this kind of reaction, nobody threw a pig's head. … Could the next thing be a pipe bomb?"
Summary: A severed pig's head was found near a Philadelphia mosque on Monday, with surveillance footage showing a red pickup truck driving by the building and throwing the head out a window, sparking an investigation and concerns about increased hostility towards Muslims in the area due to anti-immigrant rhetoric and backlash after the Paris attacks and San Bernardino shooting.
Story: – A second male masseur yesterday joined a $2 million lawsuit against John Travolta, accusing the actor of sexual battery and harassment. The man tells Radar that he has "substantial documentation and numerous witnesses regarding the substance of Travolta's actions." The suit was first filed last week by another masseur who claims that Travolta made a grab for his genitals and masturbated during a massage in a Beverly Hills hotel bungalow. The second masseur describes a similar incident early this year at an Atlanta resort after Travolta, in a "strange demeanor, with bloodshot eyes, climbed onto the massage table," according to the amended suit, which doesn't name either man. Travolta was in Atlanta at the time filming the Killing Season with Robert De Niro. Travolta attorney Marty Singer said early this week: "The problem in America is anyone can sue anyone," and he vowed to make the attorney and first plaintiff "regret they filed this fabricated suit." This "second anonymous claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one," Singer told People.
Summary: A second male masseur has joined a $2 million lawsuit against John Travolta, accusing the actor of sexual battery and harassment, with the second masseur providing documentation and witnesses to support his claims of similar incidents involving Travolta.
Story: – Another year, another controversial TLC show gets the boot. After pulling episodes of 19 Kids and Counting, TLC confirms it has canceled its most-watched show after claims that cast member Josh Duggar molested four of his sisters and a babysitter as a teen. 19 Kids "will no longer appear on the air" after 10 seasons, the network tells the AP, calling the move "the best way forward." TLC says it will kick off a campaign to raise awareness about child sex abuse, to begin with a commercial-free documentary featuring Duggar sisters Jill Dillard and Jessa Seewald in August. "They're interested in putting the focus on this issue, too," a TLC rep says of the Duggar family. Seewald and Dillard came forward as victims last month in an interview with Fox News. Josh Duggar hasn't admitted to the molestation claims but vaguely apologized back in May for acting "inexcusably"; he has never been charged. "We are so thankful for our film crew that has shown up at our house for over a decade," the Duggar family says in a statement, per the Washington Post. "They have become like family to us. They have invested their time and energy into our lives and have been so loving and patient. We love and appreciate them so much!"
Summary: TLC has canceled its most-watched show "19 Kids and Counting" after it was revealed that the show's star, Josh Duggar, molested several of his sisters and a babysitter as a teenager, with the network planning to raise awareness about child sex abuse and featuring Duggar sisters Jill Dillard and Jessa Seewald in an upcoming documentary.
Story: – A police officer far removed from the weekend violence in Virginia faces disciplinary action because of it. That's because Conrad Lariviere, a cop from Springfield, Mass., made what even he admits is a "stupid comment" online about Saturday's fatal car crash, reports MassLive. "Hahahaha love this, maybe people shouldn't block roads," Lariviere wrote on Facebook in response to a story about the car plowing into counter-protesters. Someone who saw the comment complained to the city police department. "Never would I want someone to get murdered," Lariviere told MassLive. He said he wasn't a racist and didn't support the white supremacist rally, adding, "I'm a good man who made a stupid comment and would just like to be left alone." Springfield's police chief says he has launched an investigation, and the matter will be brought before a police review board. Mayor Domenic Sarno doesn't sound sympathetic. "There is no place for this in our society, let alone from a Springfield police officer," he said, per CBS Boston.
Summary: A Springfield, Massachusetts police officer is facing disciplinary action after making a "stupid comment" on Facebook in response to a car crash that killed counter-protesters at a white supremacist rally in Virginia, with the officer insisting he is not a racist and did not support the rally but acknowledges making a "stupid" comment.
Story: – In June, ISIS did the barbaric: slaughtered scores of soldiers at a base on the outskirts of Tikrit. With the city newly liberated, Iraqi forensic teams have now begun the grim process of excavating suspected mass graves thought to contain some of the 1,700 soldiers ISIS claims to have killed at Camp Speicher. The AP cites an official with the country's Human Rights Ministry who says eight sites within the complex of presidential palaces are being worked on; Reuters puts the number of suspected mass graves at 12. Another official yesterday told Reuters that "initial indications show indisputably" that a handful of bodies recovered yesterday are those of Speicher victims, though DNA testing will be carried out to confirm this. The AP notes that one clip aired on Iraqi state TV showed unearthed skeletal remains still wearing combat boots. A CNN reporter on the scene describes decomposed bodies with their hands still tied together. In making its claim, ISIS released photos showing soldiers being led to trenches and then facedown in them before and after their execution. Other videos showed masked gunmen bringing the soldiers to a bloodstained concrete river waterfront, shooting them in the head, and tossing them into the Tigris. Previous reports have stated that if the number of dead is indeed 1,700, the massacre would rank as by far the largest atrocity in the country in more than a decade.
Summary: ISIS militants have been excavated suspected mass graves in Iraq's Tikrit, with at least 8 sites being worked on, and initial remains found include decomposed bodies with still-tied hands, as the group releases photos and videos of the soldiers being executed and thrown into trenches.
Story: – Herman Cain has just run "head first into the brick wall of conservative anti-anti-racism," writes Adam Serwer at Mother Jones. To recap: Rick Perry spent yesterday dodging bullets over his family's ill-named hunting camp, "Niggerhead"; Herman Cain rebuked Perry on TV for "a lack of insensitivity"; now GOP commentators are taking aim at Herman Cain. Why? Thank "the attitude on the right that accusations of racism directed at white people are of far greater consequence than any lingering vestiges of institutional racism nonwhites might face," Serwer writes. A few samples: "It also seems to be a slander Herman Cain is picking up and running with as a way to get into second place," writes Erick Erickson at RedState. Before now, Cain's "big appeal is that he's not just another black race-card-playing politician," says Glenn Reynolds at Instapundit. Cain's criticism was "a cheap shot, and, perhaps a signal that Cain is willing to play the race card against a fellow Republican when it benefits him," writes Matt Lewis at Daily Caller. "The key phrase here is 'fellow Republican,'" writes Serwer. "Because, you see, no one thought Cain was 'playing the race card' when he said in the same program that black people are 'brainwashed' into voting for Democrats."
Summary: Herman Cain has faced backlash from conservative commentators for criticizing Rick Perry's use of the term "Niggerhead," with some accusing Cain of playing the "race card" against a fellow Republican.
Story: – A court commissioner on Monday issued a temporary restraining order against Rob Kardashian in response to the reality television star's posting of explicit images of ex-fiancee Blac Chyna on social media last week. The order will remain in effect until an Aug. 8 hearing; Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner James E. Blancarte said his primary concern was the former couple's infant baby, who was not listed in Chyna's requests for a protective order. Blancarte sealed exhibits in the case, citing their explicit nature. Chyna's attorney Lisa Bloom said after the hearing that the restraining order prevents Kardashian from posting anything about her client online and orders him to stay away from her. Bloom said in court that the pair has nannies to handle custody transfers while the restraining order is in place. Kardashian did not appear at Monday's hearing. "We apologize and have offered our regrets for what has taken place in the last few days," his lawyer, Robert Shapiro, said outside the courthouse. He said the former couple remains focused on their daughter, who he said is currently being cared for by Kardashian. "I want to (get) back to co-parenting Dream," Chyna said outside the courthouse. TMZ references additional filings made by Bloom that allege an incident of domestic violence in April, during which Kardashian allegedly punched Chyna and then punched a hole through her bedroom door in an attempt to get to her. TMZ also quotes sources who say Chyna tired to choke Kardashian with an iPhone cord in December. Chyna gave an interview to Good Morning America that aired Monday; in it, she discusses her initial attraction to Kardashian.
Summary: A court commissioner issued a temporary restraining order against Rob Kardashian, prohibiting him from posting explicit images of his ex-fiancee Blac Chyna online and staying away from her, with the primary concern being the couple's infant baby.
Story: – In a new Atlantic interview, Hillary Clinton has underlined her differences with President Obama on foreign policy—particularly when it comes to Syria. Clinton pointed to the administration's limited involvement in Syria as a major factor in the Islamic State's surge to power in Iraq, Politico notes. "The failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad—there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle—the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled," she told Jeffrey Goldberg. Clinton did, however, note that she "can totally understand the cautions that we had to contend with," but we can't "claim to know" how things could have gone had we opted to "carefully vet, train, and equip early on a core group of the developing Free Syrian Army," Politico reports. Among other highlights from the interview: Clinton made what Goldberg calls a "vociferous defense of Israel" in the recent Gaza crisis. "Israel did what it had to do to respond to the rockets," she said. "There’s no doubt in my mind that Hamas initiated this conflict. … So the ultimate responsibility has to rest on Hamas and the decisions it made." She also criticized Obama's broader foreign-policy stance, which he has characterized as "Don't do stupid stuff." "Great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle," Clinton said. She noted that "when you’re down on yourself, and when you are hunkering down and pulling back, you’re not going to make any better decisions than when you were aggressively, belligerently putting yourself forward." Goldberg feels Clinton made her intentions for 2016 fairly clear: She suggested that while some of her positions might seem "old fashioned," she was "about to find out, in more ways than one."
Summary: Hillary Clinton criticized President Obama's foreign policy, particularly in Syria, arguing that the administration's limited involvement allowed ISIS to gain power, and she defended Israel's actions in the Gaza conflict, criticizing Hamas for initiating the conflict and Obama's broader foreign policy stance of "Don't do stupid stuff" as insufficient for a great nation.
Story: – A newly deciphered clay tablet from ancient Babylon has science writers buzzing because it just might "rewrite the history of mathematics," as Live Science puts it. The tablet shows that Babylonians were using sophisticated geometric principles to track the path of Jupiter in the sky, says researcher Mathieu Ossendrijver of Humboldt University in Berlin, who deciphered the tablet and published his findings in Science. What's intriguing is that these early astronomers wrote their calculations sometime between 350BC and 50BC—at least 1,400 years earlier than the European mathematicians who currently get credit for inventing the technique, reports NPR. The upshot is that the Babylonians were dabbling in abstract principles dealing with Jupiter's velocity and position relative to other stars in the sky, and they described that movement using a "sort of precalculus," in the words of the New York Times. "It is an application in astronomy that was totally new," says Ossendrijver. He calls it "truly an astonishing find," and while he may be biased, others in the field seem equally wowed. "I think it's quite a remarkable discovery," says a professor at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. The Times has a layman's explainer: "The Babylonians were calculating the distance Jupiter traveled in the sky from its appearance to its position 60 days later. Using the technique of splitting a trapezoid into two smaller ones of equal area, they then figured out how long it took Jupiter to travel half that distance." Babylonians were known to be talented astronomers and mathematicians, but the small tablet takes them far above previous estimations, observes National Geographic. "This geometrical trick rewrites the history books." (Scientists are getting closer to unraveling an ancient Incan technique as well.)
Summary: A recently deciphered Babylonian clay tablet has revealed that ancient Babylonians used sophisticated geometric principles to track the movement of Jupiter in the sky, calculations that were at least 1,400 years ahead of their time and rewrite the history of mathematics.
Story: – Bill Clinton wondered about the meaning of "is" when talking to the grand jury vis-a-vis Monica Lewinsky in 1998; now John Edwards' defense team is building its case around the word "the," reports ABC News. The statute at the heart of the case refers to campaign cash designated "for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office." In this case, the word "the" suggests that the money was spent in order to influence the election, say Edwards' lawyers, who argue that Edwards' main intention in hiding Rielle Hunter was to keep knowledge of her existence from his wife. Prosecutors, however, say that "the purpose" should be read as "a purpose." Politico shares this from the lead prosecutor: "Because people rarely act with a single purpose in mind, it is not necessary that you find that a gift, purchase, or payment was made solely for the purpose of influencing a federal election ... influencing any election for federal office" need only be one of the purposes. The defense counters that that line of thinking could be used to justify using campaign funds to pay for far more scurrilous things. "Under the government's logic, if spending money to conceal an affair is campaign related because it is spent for 'the purpose of influencing an election,'" then a candidate's campaign cash could "pay, for example, for his mistress to have an abortion to conceal the affair."
Summary: John Edwards' defense team is arguing that the word "the" in a campaign finance statute refers to a specific purpose of influencing a federal election, while prosecutors argue that it can refer to any purpose, including concealing an affair.
Story: – President Obama may have thrown away the whole election with his woeful performance in last week's debate, writes Andrew Sullivan at the Daily Beast. The latest Pew poll numbers show that Obama's lead has been eradicated, with Romney now enjoying a 4-point lead after a 12-point swing. Romney is now ahead in favorability and is even with Obama among women voters after a staggering 18-point shift. "And we are told that when Obama left the stage that night, he was feeling good," Sullivan writes. "That's terrifying. On every single issue, Obama has instantly plummeted into near-oblivion." "I've never seen a candidate this late in the game, so far ahead, just throw in the towel in the way Obama did last week—throw away almost every single advantage he had with voters and manage to enable his opponent to seem as if he cares about the middle class as much as Obama does," writes Sullivan, who doubts the president will be able to recover. Sullivan is dismayed by the Pew poll, but conservative blogger Allahpundit calls it "the most exciting poll of the last four years." The numbers suggest that more voters have started identifying as GOPers after the debate, and "perennial Republicans are so energized by Romney’s ass-kicking that they may show up in even greater numbers than expected," he writes at Hot Air.
Summary: President Obama's poor performance in the debate has led to a significant shift in the polls, with Romney now enjoying a 4-point lead and gaining ground among women voters, according to the latest Pew poll.
Story: – It's bad to be seated next to a snorer on a plane. Worse is if you snore, and you get seated next to someone armed with a pen who evidently can't stand it. Southwest says a woman on a plane used her pen to jab the arm of the sleeping guy next to her more than once. After he woke up howling, the taxiing plane returned to the gate, and the woman was kicked off the flight from Chicago to New Hampshire, reports USA Today. "Imagine being asleep and then being stung by bees, and then waking up and going, 'Oww,'" air traveler Lenny Mordarski tells ABC7. A fellow traveler says Mordarski's arm may have brushed the woman's on the armrest and set her off. The Chicago Fire Department checked out Mordarski's bruised arm, and he continued on his way without pressing charges. The woman was allowed to take a later flight.
Summary: A woman on a plane allegedly used a pen to jab the arm of a sleeping man next to her, causing him to wake up in pain and leading to the woman being kicked off the flight.
Story: – The plant tequila is derived from could play a role in fighting obesity, and it doesn't involve getting people so drunk they forget to eat, researchers say. Natural sugars found in agave appear to protect mice against obesity and type 2 diabetes, Fox News reports. The sugars, known as agavins, acted as a dietary fiber and were not absorbed into the bloodstream, leading researchers to believe they could be an ideal artificial sweetener for obese or diabetic people. "In certain circumstances, artificial sweeteners are useful in helping people maintain glucose control," an expert tells MedPage Today. "If this is all true, it sounds like it could be another additional tool for people with diabetes." The researchers say "agavins have a great potential as a light sweetener," though two big obstacles exist: They aren't that widely available, and they aren't very sweet. And if you're an agave syrup fan, take note: That syrup is very different from agavins; the researchers liken it more to high-fructose corn syrup. (In more booze- and health-related news, click to read about the case of a man whose body produces its own alcohol.)
Summary: Agave-derived sugars, known as agavins, may provide a natural alternative to artificial sweeteners for fighting obesity and type 2 diabetes, as they are not absorbed into the bloodstream and have a potential as a light sweetener, although their limited availability and lack of sweetness pose challenges.
Story: – Gunmen in Mexico have raided and set fire to a printing plant in the fourth attack on Monterrey-area media facilities in the space of weeks. The plant was used to print and distribute magazines, including leading news magazine Proceso, which reports extensively on the country's drug war and has had several of its journalists murdered, reports the AP. Nobody was injured in the latest attack, and the fire was put out relatively quickly. Over the weekend, gunmen stormed a Monterrey branch office of the newspaper El Norte and set it on fire. Experts believe the cartels are trying to silence the few remaining outlets that report on the drug war and on official corruption. "There are parts of the country where criminal groups decide what gets published and what doesn't," a media expert at Mexico City's Ibero-American University tells al-Jazeera. "They're trying to extend the pressure."
Summary: Gunmen in Mexico have launched four attacks on media facilities in the Monterrey area in recent weeks, including a printing plant used by leading news magazine Proceso, in an attempt to silence the few remaining outlets reporting on the drug war and official corruption.
Story: – Iceland is hot, and no, this isn't a story about global warming. Since the tiny island country in the northern Atlantic began keeping tabs in 1949, the number of visiting tourists has climbed from roughly 5,000 people a year to, in 2010, more than 500,000. Then, in 2011, "things went bonkers," as Vox reports. Eyjafjallajokull's 2010 eruption stymied European air traffic for a week and made global headlines even longer. Iceland's tourism board pounced on all that attention with a series of "Inspired by Iceland" videos that featured everything from glaciers and fjords to women dipping in hot springs sans bathing suits. What's not to love? The US has long represented a sizeable chunk of Iceland's total tourist population, and 2016 is no different. Of the 1.61 million visitors to the tiny northern European island so far this year, 325,000 have been American—compare that to the country's population: 332,000. Business Insider lists five reasons behind the boom, and Eyjafjallajokull unsurprisingly takes the top slot. Others are perhaps more compelling for anyone contemplating his or her next destination: From the East Coast, flights can be as short as 5 hours long; Kayak.com put a trip to Reykjavik as No. 8 on its list of Top 10 Wallet Friendly International destinations. Also, it's not just safe but safe. Global Peace Index this year named Iceland the safest country in the world. (Icelanders also want to help house more Syrian refugees.)
Summary: In 2010, Iceland's tourism boomed after the Eyjafjallajokull eruption, with over 500,000 visitors in 2010 and 1.61 million in 2016, with the US representing a significant portion of those visitors, drawn by factors such as short flight times, affordability, and safety, with the country being named the safest in the world by the Global Peace Index.
Story: – Fentanyl suppliers on the so-called "dark web" are delisting the drug because it's just too dangerous—and tends to attract police attention, the Guardian reports. If true, the move places fentanyl alongside explosives and certain firearms that are too risky for some purveyors to sell. "There are marketplaces that will not accept listings for weapons and explosives—those are the ones that will not accept listings for fentanyl," says Vince O’Brien, a drug-enforcement officer at the National Crime Agency in Britain. "Clearly, law enforcement would prioritize the supply of weapons, explosives and fentanyl over, for example, class C drugs—and that might well be why they do this." A powerful pain-killer, fentanyl is so dangerous that even a sugar packet of it can kill 500 people, the LA Times reports. The opioid's rising popularity has caused roughly 160 deaths in the UK and many more in America, where nearly 29,000 people died in 2017 from synthetic-opioid-linked overdoses. Police say labs in China are producing fentanyl, which is often processed by Mexican cartels and sold domestically as pills or mixed into heroin and other substances. Some users procure it directly online, where sellers may be getting nervous. Even drug users "on the dark web say on forums that they don't think it's right that people are selling fentanyl because it is dangerous and kills a lot of people," says O'Brien. (A young man gave a teen fentanyl and raped her dead body.)
Summary: Fentanyl suppliers on the dark web are delisting the drug due to its high danger and tendency to attract police attention, with some marketplaces refusing to accept listings for the drug due to its deadly potency and the risk of causing 500 deaths with just a sugar packet.
Story: – Day 3 of the Republican National Convention has been dubbed "Make America First Again" day, and a new slew of speakers will speak to that mission Wednesday evening at Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena, USA Today reports. Indiana governor and now VP nominee Mike Pence will get his moment in the spotlight, where he'll need to make inroads with the American public: A CBS News poll taken July 8-12 found that 86% of voters either don't know enough about him to form an opinion or are undecided on how they feel. A trio that Trump defeated for the GOP nomination will also speak at the convention: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and (via video) Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Former VP hopeful Newt Gingrich and his wife, Callista, will also appear to make one of the night's final speeches. Meanwhile, Eric Trump will offer words in his role as, per USA Today, the "obligatory Trump family representative." The New York Times notes that an imperative for the GOP on Wednesday is to simply pull off a single day "without unwanted distraction or unforced errors" in the wake of some convention floor discord (an "open revolt" Monday, Alaska contesting its vote count Tuesday) and the Melania Trump plagiarism to-do. A bunch of "Trump allies" will take the stage before the main speakers, including Fox News regular Laura Ingraham and nutritional supplement marketer Michelle Van Etten, and Vox notes that "while odds are they won't ruffle any feathers, there's potential for some wackadoo hijinks." The Times also wonders if Cruz will "play nice," as well as whether Trump will make yet another cameo and try to top his "professional wrestling-style entrance" from Monday and his presence via video feed on Tuesday. (It's doubtful Trump's running mate will address the failed Trump/Pence logo.)
Summary: On the third day of the Republican National Convention, Mike Pence will take center stage as the newly appointed VP nominee, while other speakers including Ted Cruz, Scott Walker, and Newt Gingrich will also address the audience, with the GOP aiming to avoid further controversy after recent floor discord and the Melania Trump plagiarism scandal.
Story: – "As a kid growing up in the inner city ... you don't really think past high school. You don't really know your future." Those were the words of LeBron James in Sandusky, Ohio, yesterday as he announced how he plans to change that outcome: by offering full scholarships to at-risk Akron kids to attend the University of Akron, Cleveland.com reports. Thanks to a partnership between the basketball star's LeBron James Family Foundation, the university, and JPMorgan Chase, any child who graduates from Akron public schools from 2021 to 2029, sticks with the foundation's mentorship program from third grade through graduation, and meets certain testing, attendance, and community service requirements will receive a free ride to the college, right now worth about $9,500 per year. "We're giving you guys free scholarships," James said after he made the announcement at a Cedar Point gathering of mostly at-risk local kids and their families. "Do you guys know how much money [that's worth]? This means so much to me, so much to these kids." With around 1,100 kids currently in James' program, plus an estimated 1,200 to be added over the next four years, as many as 2,300 kids could eventually nab one of these scholarships, the Akron Beacon Journal notes. JPMorgan Chase's role: to develop a database that will collect and measure student data to make sure they fulfill all needed criteria. (LeBron isn't just making his mark on education—he's also taking on Tinseltown.)
Summary: LeBron James is offering full scholarships to at-risk Akron kids to attend the University of Akron, covering tuition worth around $9,500 per year, through a partnership with the university, his foundation, and JPMorgan Chase.
Story: – The search for a missing Oregon mother who vanished while running errands is over with the discovery of her body near her SUV in a remote area, reports the Oregonian. Police say there's no sign of foul play in the death of Jennifer Huston. The 38-year-old disappeared on July 24 after telling her husband that she was off to run some errands in Dundee, near Portland. Surveillance video showed that she withdrew $100 from an ATM, bought items including over-the-counter sleeping pills from a drug store, and gassed up her SUV before dropping out of sight. A property owner in Sheridan, about 20 miles away, found her vehicle this morning on a logging road, and police discovered her body nearby, reports Reuters. Her husband had said that she was suffering from headaches the last few days before her disappearance, but that she was in good health otherwise. The Hustons were set to celebrate their 10-year anniversary later this month, reports KING5, and their two sons, ages 6 and 2, both have birthdays next month.
Summary: Jennifer Huston, a 38-year-old Oregon mother who disappeared while running errands, was found dead near her SUV in a remote area, with no signs of foul play, after surveillance footage showed her withdrawing money and buying sleeping pills before vanishing.
Story: – Hilary Duff and hockey player Mike Comrie are getting married. The 22-year-old actress/singer and the 29-year-old Edmonton Oiler got engaged in Hawaii last weekend, reports US Weekly. "After having been together for over two years, they are very excited to share this happy news," says a rep. Duff, who shows up in the stands in occasion, once fessed up to reading Hockey for Dummies to figure out what was going on, notes People.
Summary: Hilary Duff and Mike Comrie are getting married after two years of being together, with Duff having previously admitted to reading "Hockey for Dummies" to understand the sport.
Story: – If you stopped eating crabs at PETA's request, you'll probably love the animal rights group's latest idea. PETA has asked Maine officials for permission to build a 5-foot tombstone in Brunswick to honor an estimated 4,500 lobsters killed when a truck overturned on a highway last week, reports Fox News. The Maine Department of Transportation is reviewing the request, which includes a mock-up of the tombstone for "sensitive crustaceans." "In Memory of the Lobsters Who Suffered and Died at This Spot," it reads, followed by "Try Vegan." Locals aren't exactly on board. "We don't even put monuments up for people who die," one tells WGME.
Summary: PETA has requested permission from Maine officials to build a 5-foot tombstone to honor the estimated 4,500 lobsters that died in a recent highway accident, with the inscription "In Memory of the Lobsters Who Suffered and Died at This Spot" and "Try Vegan."
Story: – Yesterday's Google Doodle completely ignored Easter in favor of Cesar Chavez's birthday, and conservatives are livid, Politico reports. "While two billion Christians around the world celebrate Easter Sunday on this 31st day of March, Google is using its famous ‘Doodle’ search logo art to mark the birth of left-wing labor leader Cesar Chavez," said Michelle Malkin's site, Twitchy. Meanwhile, commentator Michael Krempasky tweeted, "Settings>Search>Default>Bing." A Google rep says no harm was meant: "We enjoy celebrating holidays at Google, but, as you may imagine, it’s difficult for us to choose which events to highlight on our site ... Sometimes for a given date, we feature an historical event or influential figure that we haven’t in the past."
Summary: Google's Easter Doodle was replaced by a tribute to Cesar Chavez, sparking outrage from conservatives who feel the tech giant ignored the religious holiday.
Story: – Mitt Romney is going to win the New Hampshire primary, and everyone ostensibly knows it. But that doesn't mean the results won't be interesting. Here are the contests the pundits are watching: Romney vs. expectations: With Romney's victory assured, pundits are speculating over his vote tally. One strategist tells Politico he has to hit at least 38%—John McCain's 2008 total. Romney himself managed 32% in that contest, but anything nearly that low would raise serious questions now. Jon Huntsman vs. Ron Paul: This looks to be the battle for second place, and both have invested much here. If Huntsman can bump off Paul, he might get a second look, "but that's a big if," writes Gwen Ifill at the National Journal (Nate Silver agrees). Rick Santorum vs. Newt Gingrich: They're battling for fourth, and the winner might look like the conservative alternative heading into South Carolina. Nationally, Santorum is polling strong, Jonathan Bernstein of the Washington Post points out, so it'll be interesting to see if a New Hampshire dud derails him. The polls vs. the public: New Hampshire polls are notoriously unreliable; Romney should prevail, but everything after him is up for grabs. The Union Leader vs. momentum: Did New Hampshire's influential paper manage to boost the flailing Gingrich? New Hampshire vs. conservatives: If Romney, Huntsman, and Paul combine for 80% of the vote, Bernstein thinks Republicans may decide they have a "New Hampshire problem," with an early-voting state too heavily weighted toward moderates.
Summary: In the New Hampshire primary, Mitt Romney is expected to win, but the results will be interesting as pundits watch for his vote tally, a potential Huntsman-Paul battle for second place, a Santorum-Gingrich battle for fourth, and the impact of polls and the influential Union Leader on the race.
Story: – Gross Crime of the Day: A man was arrested yesterday after allegedly fondling and licking the feet of two children in an upstate New York library. Anthony S. Perri faces sex abuse and other charges; he is accused of taking off the children's shoes and then pressing their feet against his face for sexual gratification. He confessed to cops, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reports, and then blamed the whole thing on President Obama and others during a tirade after being arrested. Police are looking into the possibility that Perri was involved with five similar incidents in the area, in which girls between ages 5 and 10 had their feet licked in bookstores and libraries, WHAM reports. But don't confuse him with Joey Leaphart, who was arrested last week after allegedly tricking an 18-year-old woman into letting him suck her toe. Leaphart approached the woman inside a Walmart and pretended to be from America's Funniest Home Videos, saying she would be paid $100 to go along with the "prank." The Smoking Gun notes that the 43-year-old is a "registered sex offender whose rap sheet is littered with foot-related crimes."
Summary: A man was arrested for fondling and licking the feet of two children in an upstate New York library, and he confessed and blamed President Obama and others during a tirade after being arrested, with police investigating possible additional incidents involving girls aged 5-10 in the area.
Story: – The North Koreans failed to show up to a scheduled meeting Thursday during which they were slated to discuss the repatriation of American soldiers' remains with US officials. That's per the New York Times, where it was reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo indicated last week that the talks would happen on or around Thursday in the inter-Korean border and said the date might change. There was no indication of whether the North Koreans intentionally blew off the meeting. During June's meeting between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the North Korean leader said the country is committed to getting the remains of US soldiers killed in the Korean War back to American soil. Meanwhile, USA Today reports that Kim recently praised his historic meeting with Trump as "the start of a meaningful journey." The Trump administration released a letter from Kim, dated July 6, after officials say it was given to Pompeo to deliver to Trump when his delegation was recently in the DPRK. "I deeply appreciate the energetic and extraordinary efforts made by Your Excellency Mr. President for the improvement of relations between the two countries," the letter read, in part. Trump shared the letter in a tweet Thursday, writing, "A very nice note from Chairman Kim of North Korea. Great progress being made!"
Summary: North Korea failed to show up for a scheduled meeting with US officials to discuss the repatriation of American soldiers' remains, despite previous indications from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the talks would take place on or around Thursday.
Story: – Women are more attracted to a man with facial hair, says a new poll. Among the participants, 54% said they preferred a guy not to be clean-shaven. Of those, two-thirds liked all-over stubble, 19% liked moustaches, 12% preferred beards, and 6% goatees. Only about a third of women polled said they wanted a completely clean-shaven man, the Daily Mail reports. The results indicated that women found men with facial hair to be more "masculine." As for body hair, 51% said hair on the chest and back was desirable, while 27% preferred a completely waxed male bod. The study, conducted by Mycelebrityfashion.co.uk, polled 1,832 women over the age of 18.
Summary: According to a poll of 1,832 women, 54% prefer men with facial hair, with two-thirds liking all-over stubble, 19% liking moustaches, 12% preferring beards, and 6% goatees, while only about a third prefer a completely clean-shaven man, with women finding men with facial hair to be more "masculine."
Story: – A video showing a monkey apparently attempting to revive his companion has gone viral after being posted on YouTube this weekend, but is that really what the monkey is doing? The short answer, according to National Geographic: It's not clear. The rhesus macaques in the video are shown at a train station in India, where one of them was apparently shocked by wires and fell unconscious on the tracks. A companion is shown poking it, dragging it around, and even pouring water on it for about 20 minutes before the first monkey eventually revives. The video refers to the monkey giving its pal "CPR," but an expert says we can't know for sure what was really going on or whether the monkey's actions were intentional. "In this particular case, does the male shaking the body of the injured individual know that by shaking it and dropping it in water, it can reanimate it?" she asks. Though the answer is not clear, she adds, the video is "an amazing representation of the complexity of primate behavior." She says that not much research has been done into how nonhuman primates react to death, but that scientists have sometimes seen them "shaking the body of the dead animal, as not accepting its immobility, and also reacting by rough behaviors seemingly aimed at reanimation."
Summary: A video of a monkey attempting to revive its unconscious companion at a train station in India has gone viral, but it's unclear whether the monkey's actions were intentional or simply a response to the shock and immobility of its companion, with experts suggesting that the video may represent a complex reaction to death in nonhuman primates.
Story: – Strange as it sounds, novelist Chuck Palahniuk apologized and expressed gratitude after learning he's been cheated. The Fight Club author blogged this week that his dwindling income can be attributed to an alleged embezzler at his literary agency who's accused of stealing millions, TorrentFreak reports. "I apologize for cursing my publishers," Palahniuk writes. "And I apologize for any rants about piracy. My publishers had paid the royalties. Piracy, when it existed, was small scale. I do hereby humbly apologize." He had wondered if his Manhattan literary agency Donadio & Olson had a thief, but "that was insanity." The alleged embezzler, Darin Webb, was arrested May 15 on wire-fraud charges and faces 20 years in prison, the New York Post reports. According to legal papers, the 47-year-old is accused of stealing $3.4 million from the agency and confessed to the crime in a videotaped interview with Donadio & Olson executives. His apparent handiwork came to light when an author complained last fall of not receiving a $200,000 advance. Now, it seems, Palahniuk knows why he's been going broke and paying for his own book-tour shows. He also has friends and colleagues offering money. "So where I'm at doesn't feel so bad," he writes. "In this crisis I feel grateful and touched."
Summary: Chuck Palahniuk apologized for blaming his publishers for his financial struggles and expressed gratitude after discovering that his literary agency's alleged embezzler, Darin Webb, stole $3.4 million, facing 20 years in prison.

Story: – On the bright side, the Virginia-based retailer USA Discounters offers loans to customers who have no credit. The downside? Those loans may be predatory, and customers who fail to pay will get sued in Virginia courtrooms no matter where they live, Pacific Standard reports. An added wrinkle: Many of the customers are in the US military. "They’re basically ruthless," an Army staff sergeant said after he bought items at a Georgia outlet and was sued in Virginia while serving in Germany. Yet the company still attracts service members by offering them credit counseling in stores near military bases. And "after the horse is out of the barn, there’s not a lot you can do about it," says a finance expert. Take Army Private Jeramie Mays: He bought a $650 laptop for $2,993 (including add-ons and interest over 23 months) at a USA Discounters in Texas, then failed to pay and eventually filed for bankruptcy. His story isn't so unusual, either: USA Discounters has won 89% of its 13,470 Virginia lawsuits since 2006, court records say, and seizes more pay from military service members than any other US company, ProPublica reports. For its part, the company says its practices are clear in the contract, and active-military customers can seek trial outside of Virginia upon request. "This company is committed to ensuring" that service members "are always treated with the honor and respect they deserve," said a USA Discounters executive.
Summary: USA Discounters, a Virginia-based retailer, offers loans to customers with no credit history, including military personnel, but the loans are predatory and can lead to lawsuits in Virginia courts, despite the company's claims of clear contracts and options for military customers to seek trial outside of Virginia.
Story: – Syria’s diverse opposition has finally come together in an official coalition, a move that should help the movement gain international support as violence continues, with at least 10 protesters killed yesterday. The new Syrian National Council brings together protest organizers, Kurdish groups, Syria’s banned Muslim Brotherhood, and others; about half of its members are from within the country, the Christian Science Monitor reports. “The fact that Islamists, secular figures, and activists on the ground are now on one council is a significant,” a diplomat says. “But they still have to demonstrate that they could be politically savvy and able to fill any political vacuum." The council has called for nonviolence, but noted in a statement that the government had brought the country “to the edge of civil war” and is “inviting foreign interference." Meanwhile, members of Bashar al-Assad’s regime conducted home raids last night into this morning, a human rights watchdog tells Bloomberg; many were arrested outside Damascus. The Washington Post has more on the new council.
Summary: The Syrian National Council, a newly formed coalition of opposition groups, aims to gain international support as violence continues in Syria, with a focus on nonviolence and a call for the government to be held accountable for bringing the country to the brink of civil war.
Story: – Two pilots for Argentine carrier Austral Lineas Aereas are out of a job after they acted a little too generously with a passenger who just so happened to be a Playboy model. Victoria Xipolitakis tweeted photos, since removed, showing her sandwiched between pilots Patricio Zocchi Molina, 33, and Federico Matias Soaje, 37, during a recent flight from Buenos Aires to Rosario, Argentina, reports Mashable. But that's not all: In one of six videos Xipolitakis, 29, recorded, a pilot can be heard telling her that she can fly the plane; she claims she flew the aircraft during takeoff. Xipolitakis, who is now banned from the airline for five years, has since apologized. Fox News Latino reports some of the 36 passengers on board are preparing to sue the airline.
Summary: Two pilots for Argentine airline Austral Lineas Aereas were fired after a passenger, a Playboy model, recorded them allowing her to fly the plane during takeoff and one of the pilots telling her she could fly the aircraft.
Story: – It seemed like such an innocent request. In her 1818 novel Frankenstein, Mary Shelley has the monster ask Dr. Frankenstein for a mate, and the creature promises that he and his female counterpart would then go live in some remote corner of South America and never bother humans. The doctor initially agrees, then changes his mind. Good thing: As two scientists point out in a perfect-for-Halloween study in BioScience, if Dr. Frankenstein had allowed his creature to do so, it would have doomed mankind under a principle of biology known as competitive exclusion, reports Nature World News. They're especially impressed because Shelley seemed to have a handle on this more than a century before it was formally defined. In the book, Shelley voices the doctor's rationale: "A race of devils would be propagated upon Earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror," per the Christian Science Monitor. He was spot on, write Nathaniel Dominy of Dartmouth and Justin Yeakel of the University of California, Merced. "We calculated that a founding population of two creatures could drive us to extinction in as little as 4,000 years," says Dominy. They crunched a slew of factors including population densities and competitive advantages of the creatures vs. humans. The monster's request to go to South America was key—it was relatively sparsely populated at the time, which would have allowed his descendants to thrive. Shelley "accurately anticipated fundamental concepts in ecology and evolution by many decades," writes Yeakel in a post at Phys.org. (Scientists have backed up Shelley's Frankenstein moon tale.)
Summary: In Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein, the monster asks Dr. Frankenstein for a mate and promises to live in a remote corner of South America, but two scientists argue that allowing this to happen would have led to the extinction of humanity due to the principle of competitive exclusion.
Story: – Khloe Kardashian is speaking out about her relationship with Lamar Odom, and she continues to insist romance is not part of the equation. "My biggest wish is for him to be happy. I still have a great deal of love for him," she tells Redbook in a new interview. She expanded on that a bit Monday night during a book signing for her new book, Strong Looks Better Naked. "I'm still married for a multitude reasons, but intimacy is not one of them," she told NBC News, adding that Odom is aware she's still dating James Harden. As for how Odom is doing after being found unconscious at a Nevada brothel, he's "doing better every day for sure—which is a blessing—but it's going to be a long road, and he has to walk that road. He has to walk that road, it's going to be a long time," she said. "He's aware to a degree" of what's being written about him in the media, she added, "but he doesn't have social media, he doesn't have his cell phone, he doesn't watch the news or anything like that, so he is aware from what I tell him or the messages that I give him—all positive and filtered things of course."

Story: – A device police can use to pinpoint a suspect's location with what some say is 100% reliability may just sound like the latest cool tool in a cop's catch-a-criminal arsenal. But the surveillance instrument used by the Tallahassee PD since 2007 is worrying the ACLU, judges, and citizens who say it's a violation of civil rights and the Fourth Amendment, the Washington Post reports. These so-called cell-site or cell-tower simulators (also known as IMSI catchers and often sold under the StingRay brand) trick cellphones within range into connecting to them as they would to an actual cellphone tower; police may then potentially access location and communication data from any of the "fooled" phones, as per the Post. However, when the device is flicked on, service to other phones may be disrupted, batteries drain more quickly, and info is culled from not just the suspect, but also other phones in range. The ACLU reports that Florida law enforcement agencies have spent more than $3 million on this equipment since 2008, and it's spread beyond the Sunshine State: The organization has been able to ID 48 agencies in 20 states and DC that own the simulators. Although the Tallahassee PD and FBI say the unit can only be used with a court order (and they don't collect call content or text messages with it), judges, attorneys, and the public are creeped out by the secrecy: Cops often cite an FBI "nondisclosure agreement" and refuse to explain how the technology works, saying it will compromise the device's efficacy, the Post notes. However, a public defender who took on the case of an 18-year-old busted via the device for robbery called the "scooping up [of] all manner of information from a target cellphone, as well as nearly all cellphones in the general area" nothing more than "exploratory rummaging." Click for the full report.
Summary: The Tallahassee Police Department has been using a surveillance device called a "StingRay" or "IMSI catcher" since 2007 to locate suspects' cellphones with what some say is 100% reliability, but the use of this device has raised concerns among the ACLU, judges, and citizens about potential violations of civil rights and the Fourth Amendment due to its ability to collect location and communication data from multiple phones in the area without a warrant.
Story: – The days of "calling 8" after suffering a personal injury may be over. WGRZ reports Cellino & Barnes, a Buffalo-area law firm known for its omnipresent ads and catchy jingle, may be breaking up after Ross Cellino filed suit against Stephen Barnes on Wednesday. The suit calls for the dissolution of Cellino & Barnes, which Cellino's father started in 1958, according to the New York Times. It's unclear why Cellino is suing Barnes, but the Buffalo News reports it could hypothetically be for reasons ranging from the partners no longer agreeing on anything to financial improprieties. Barnes is due in court May 19 to explain why the law firm shouldn't be dissolved. Barnes and Cellino have been practicing together for more than 30 years and now head, as People puts it, "one of the most well-known personal injury law firms." By spending heavily on ads—which include its "Don't Wait, Call 8" tagline and easily memorized 800-888-8888 phone number—Cellino & Barnes expanded to offices throughout New York and California and became a household name. “They basically invented themselves out of thin air with very thoughtful, successful, innovative advertising,” fellow Buffalo attorney Paul Cambria tells the News. He says their split will be the equivalent of "a huge business divorce." But social media users just want to know who gets custody of the jingle.
Summary: Ross Cellino has sued his longtime law partner Stephen Barnes for the dissolution of their law firm, Cellino & Barnes, which has been a prominent personal injury law firm in New York and California through its innovative advertising and catchy jingle.
Story: – Early risers in western North America on Saturday may be rewarded with a sight of the century's shortest total eclipse. While some total eclipses can last up to an hour, sky watchers will have just four minutes and 43 seconds to take in the sight of the blood moon as it just skims Earth's shadow, reports CBS San Francisco. Those west of the Mississippi River will have an ideal view as the moon begins its trek into Earth's shadow at 3:16am PDT, CNN reports. The total lunar eclipse—the third of four in a "tetrad" occurring in 18 months—will be visible beginning at 4:58am. A partial eclipse may be seen across the country, as well as in South America, India, China, and Russia. NASA says that four blood moons within 18 months is rare, occurring only a few times in the last 2,000 years. The next one will occur on Sept. 28. It's not all oohs and aahs, though: CBS notes the timing of the blood moon just ahead of Easter and this passage in the King James Bible: "The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord comes." One American pastor says that means a "great worldwide event" is to come, the Daily Mirror adds. John Hagee predicts "we're going to see something dramatic happen in the Middle East involving Israel that will change the course of history in the Middle East and impact the whole world." (Here are the first and second blood moons in the tetrad.)
Summary: A total lunar eclipse will occur on Saturday, visible in western North America for four minutes and 43 seconds, with the blood moon visible to those west of the Mississippi River, marking the third of four total eclipses in 18 months and a rare occurrence according to NASA.
Story: – Prepare to hear the word "lazy" a lot in future political ads. As Politico notes, Republicans are jumping all over comments President Obama made last weekend in response to a question about the US luring foreign investors. "We’ve been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades," said Obama. "We’ve kind of taken for granted—well, people will want to come here and we aren’t out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new business into America.” Republicans are making political hay of the "we've been a little bit lazy" part, stripped of the context of foreign investment. Rick Perry is out with a new ad calling the comment "pathetic," notes CNN. (See it in the gallery at left.) Mitt Romney also weighed in (“Sometimes I just don’t think that President Obama understands America"), as have candidates running for Senate, notes Politico. White House supporters are crying foul about being taken out of context, but an anonymous Democratic strategist doesn't blame the Republicans for seizing on the line: “I would bang that drum like I was in Occupy Wall Street,” he said.
Summary: President Obama's comment that the US has been "a little bit lazy" in attracting foreign investment has been seized upon by Republicans in political ads, with Rick Perry calling it "pathetic" and Mitt Romney and Senate candidates also weighing in.
Story: – America's whiskey drinkers have joined the trend to buy local, which is bad news for the Scots: The latest figures show that export sales of Scotch whisky dived 7% to $5.8 billion last year, largely because of a 9% fall in sales to the US, reports the BBC. The slide in American scotch sales comes amid surging sales of American whiskeys, with bourbon and Tennessee whiskey sales up more than 7% last year, reports the Wall Street Journal. The popularity of American whiskeys—especially Jack Daniel's—is also hurting scotch sales around the world, the Journal reports, but although sales of cheaper scotches like Johnnie Walker Red Label are down, the pricier single malts are still selling pretty well. (The world's best whiskey, however, comes from Japan.)
Summary: American whiskey drinkers' shift towards local brands has led to a 7% decline in Scotch whisky exports to $5.8 billion, primarily due to a 9% drop in sales to the US, with bourbon and Tennessee whiskey sales increasing by over 7%.
Story: – The Namibian desert is home to what are called "fairy circles": strange formations of grassless earth surrounded by grass. Almost perfect circles, they're the subject of local myths, the BBC reports. Researchers still don't know what causes them, but new findings could help them figure it out—even as the phenomenon becomes increasingly weird. Experts have discovered that the circles' layout matches that of skin cells, a press release reports. "It's a completely amazing, strange match," says a researcher in Japan. What makes it even more amazing is that it is highly unusual to have matching patterns on both the tiny and large scale, the release notes. The team was inspired to compare the patterns as they noticed a few things fairy circles and skin cells have in common, LiveScience reports. Both fairy circles and skin cells exhibit a life cycle "of birth, growth, and death," the scientists say in their study, and both may have to compete for space. Using satellite images, the researchers drew lines between the circles, comparing the lines to cell walls. Then they calculated the number of neighbors each fairy circle had. Turns out most fairy circles—and most skin cells—have six neighbors, and the percentages of each with other numbers of neighbors are also very similar. In case this wasn't otherworldly enough, the findings could someday help researchers investigate the possibility of extraterrestrial life based on pattern analysis, the press release notes. (Meanwhile, mystery mounds in Washington state offer puzzles of their own.)
Summary: Researchers have discovered that the patterns of fairy circles in the Namibian desert match the layout of skin cells, with both exhibiting a life cycle of birth, growth, and death, and competing for space, according to a study that could potentially lead to the investigation of extraterrestrial life based on pattern analysis.
Story: – Michele Bachmann kicks off the week as the subject of two profiles: A Newsweek cover story (whose cover image many, many people are calling creepy) and a New Yorker piece. Both suggest she's poised to do well in Iowa’s upcoming straw poll, but faces major hurdles to winning the Republican nomination. Some key points from the profiles: In Newsweek, Lois Romano points to concerns over "the perception of hypocrisy": As a lawyer, for example, Bachmann represented Tea Party enemy the IRS. She also slammed President Obama’s stimulus, then sought funds from it. But what could be "more damaging" is the country's growing recognition that the Tea Party movement truly is a radical one, writes Romano. And the Tea Party itself could lose its taste for Bachmann if she places more emphasis on social issues than on cutting the federal budget. In the New Yorker, Ryan Lizza writes that alongside her reputation for verbal gaffes, her personal history includes “a set of beliefs more extreme than those of any American politician of her stature." Lizza notes that Bachmann’s law school had trouble getting accredited because “the Bible, not the Constitution or conventional jurisprudence, guides the curriculum.” Her personal stories are a little mixed-up, Lizza writes. She set a detailed family history in Iowa when in fact it occurred in Wisconsin; she calls herself an “accidental candidate,” but she raised the prospect of running for office for a year before doing so. Why does Bachmann, but not Mitt Romeny, get picked apart by Matt Drudge? He's best friends with Romney's campaign manager, explains her speech coach. Bachmann agrees, "You never see anything about Romney on Drudge—ever."
Summary: Michele Bachmann is the subject of two profiles this week, with both suggesting she may perform well in Iowa's straw poll but faces challenges in winning the Republican nomination due to concerns over hypocrisy and her extreme beliefs, which have been criticized for being more radical than those of any other American politician of her stature.
Story: – Yet another big name in al-Qaeda has gone down: Somalia says security forces shot dead Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, who planned the US embassy truck bombings in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, reports the AFP. Mohammed, thought to have been al-Qaeda's top leader in east Africa, had a $5 million bounty on his head from the US government. Troops fired on Mohammed's vehicle when it failed to stop at a police checkpoint in Mogadishu. "We've compared the pictures of the body to his old pictures," a Somali official tells the AP. "They are the same. It is confirmed. He is the man and he is dead." A member of the al-Shebab militant group in Somalia also said Mohammed had been killed. Hillary Clinton, in Tanzania, called it a "significant blow to al-Qaeda," and said it was a "just end for a terrorist who brought so much pain to so many innocents." Last week, a drone strike killed the "brain" of al-Qaeda.
Summary: Somali security forces have shot and killed Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, a top al-Qaeda leader responsible for the 1998 US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, after he failed to stop at a police checkpoint in Mogadishu.
Story: – A woman who's modeled for Valentino, Versace, and Victoria's Secret is suing a Hilton hotel in California, claiming she was "massacred" by bedbugs. Brazilian model Sabrina Jales St. Pierre says she had a severe reaction to bedbug bites that required medical attention and affected her ability to model while staying at Palm Desert Embassy Suites two years ago. Attorney Brian Virag, who secured in October a $546,000 jury verdict over bedbugs at a Hilton Garden Inn, says the bites "covering pretty much her entire body" were among the worst he's seen. Jales St. Pierre was "embarrassed, ashamed, and humiliated" but had to keep working, he says, per the Palm Springs Desert Sun, adding "she still experiences psychological trauma" and is seeking monetary and punitive damages. Photos shared as part of the lawsuit, at least one of which includes a dated newspaper, show large red welts covering the model's shoulder, back, and legs, per the Los Angeles Times. Describing the site of the 2016 incident as "an independently owned and managed franchise property," Hilton directed questions to Embassy Suites. The general manager of the Palm Desert location essentially accuses Jales St. Pierre of lying. The hotel agreed to dry-clean her clothes after she complained, but officials and an outside pest-control company investigated and found no evidence of a bedbug infestation, Carlos Mendoza tells the Desert Sun. "We did all the proper protocols," he says. "Now we have to go through the lawsuit to defend the reputation of the hotel." (This family won $1.6 million over bedbugs.)
Summary: A Brazilian model is suing a Hilton hotel in California after suffering severe bedbug bites during a stay, resulting in medical attention and psychological trauma, with the model's lawyer citing the worst bedbug infestation he has seen.
Story: – Connie Ley's will specifically spelled out plans for her dog Bela in the event of her death: Put Bela to sleep and bury him with Ley if a designated friend or a no-kill animal shelter wouldn't take him in. Ley died in November, but when Bela's story made its way online, people started campaigning to save the German shepherd's life, even creating a #SaveBela hashtag. Those efforts paid off, because a Utah no-kill shelter that actively promotes its mission of "Save Them All" has now arranged to bring Bela from Indiana to Utah, the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. "Merry Christmas Bela!" reads a statement from Best Friends Animal Society. "We are currently arranging his transport to our sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, where he will celebrate a warm, happy holiday with lots of treats, toys, and love." It may have been the "unfounded social media backlash" against Ley, as her estate attorney calls it, that actually saved the dog. Even though Bela has a history of "intermittent aggression" and Ley had been concerned that no one would properly care for him, Best Friends got wind of the situation from the media frenzy and contacted the attorney and Ley's friend to explain how it could take care of Bela. "Our trainers and animal behavior specialists will work with Bela so that he will have every opportunity to enjoy a full and rich life," the blog reads. "Our first priority is to do everything we can to make Bela's life whole once again in keeping with Connie Ley's wishes for her beloved dog." (A Japanese mixed breed was trained to find landslide victims after escaping euthanasia.)
Summary: A German shepherd named Bela, who was originally set to be euthanized after his owner's death, was saved from being put down after a social media campaign and is now being cared for at a no-kill shelter in Utah.
Story: – Hundreds of thousands of habitual subway riders had to find other ways to work today, after San Francisco's negotiation with BART subway employees broke down around 2am. The city wants the more than 5,000 subway workers to pay more toward their pensions and benefits in exchange for an 8% pay hike, the San Jose Mercury News explains—right now, they're paid an average of $83,000 annually, and don't have to contribute anything toward retirement. BART is the nation's fifth-largest rail system, serving some 400,000 people, the LA Times reports, but reports vary on how much of a disruption shutting it down has caused. The Mercury News says commuters are "scrambling" with severe backups plaguing various highways and massive lines for buses and ferries. But the San Francisco Chronicle says that while buses were indeed packed, the roads weren't that bad. "If I just awoke today and didn't know there was a BART strike, I wouldn't have thought anything was different," says one city official. BART workers, meanwhile, picketed outside stations, waving signs proclaiming that their strike was about safety issues.
Summary: Hundreds of thousands of San Francisco subway riders were forced to find alternative modes of transportation after negotiations between the city and BART subway employees broke down, with the workers demanding higher pay and increased contributions to their pensions and benefits.
Story: – Not long into Donald Trump's presidency, Jared Kushner was told to tread carefully in his friendship with Wendi Deng Murdoch, the Wall Street Journal reports. The warning came via US counterintelligence authorities, per the Journal's sources, and was based on the belief that Murdoch could be capitalizing on the relationship she had with Kushner and wife Ivanka Trump to push the Chinese government's agenda. It flags one particular point of concern: a proposed $100 million Chinese garden at the National Arboretum on an elevated patch of land within 5 miles of the White House; it was to feature a 70-foot tower that raised surveillance concerns. A rep for Murdoch says she is unaware "of any garden projects funded by the Chinese government," and said government staunchly denied it. The paper notes that none of the parties involved have been accused of doing anything nefarious. The upshot seems to be that the warning "was part of an effort" to tell someone "new to government [of] the need to be careful in his dealings with people whose interests may not align with those of the US." Such a warning in such a scenario is not uncommon. New York magazine points out the story comes via a paper owned by News Corp, whose CEO is Murdoch's ex, Rupert Murdoch. It flags this Monday tweet from Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff (a co-founder of Newser), who also wrote a biography on Rupert Murdoch: "Since their divorce, Murdoch has been telling anybody who would listen that Wendi is a Chinese spy--and had been throughout the marriage."
Summary: US counterintelligence authorities warned Jared Kushner to be cautious in his friendship with Wendi Deng Murdoch due to concerns that she may be pushing the Chinese government's agenda, including a proposed $100 million Chinese garden near the White House that raised surveillance concerns, despite Murdoch's denials and lack of accusations of nefarious activity.
Story: – It’s a swim suit: A 61-year-old lifeguard is taking New York state to court over his bathing trunks. Roy Lester says he was fired for refusing to don a Speedo for a yearly swim test, the New York Daily News reports. He preferred to wear a less revealing bathing suit. “I wore a Speedo when I was in my 20s," he says. "But come on. There should be a law prohibiting anyone over the age of 50 from wearing a Speedo." He argues that the Long Island beach where he worked was using the rule to shed its older lifeguards—though 80% of them are over 40, he estimates. “They were just trying to get rid of the older guys. To me the whole key to being a good lifeguard is experience. An older guy sees a save before anyone else. You know the water." Indeed, “I could have passed that test”—a 100-yard swim in less than 75 seconds—“in dungarees.” (Click to see a photo of Lester in non-Speedo trunks.)
Summary: A 61-year-old lifeguard in New York is suing his employer after being fired for refusing to wear a Speedo for a swim test, citing that the rule is ageist and that his experience as an older lifeguard is more important than physical appearance.
Story: – How big could a potential new drug for Huntington's disease be? The BBC puts it this way: "Experts say it could be the biggest breakthrough in neurodegenerative diseases for 50 years." The news is preliminary—full trial results should be published in 2018—but early indications are good. As the Guardian explains, the only currently available treatments address solely symptoms, allowing the disease to march on to its deadly conclusion, which can occur within a decade of diagnosis. But this drug, called Ionis-HTTRx, appears to have slowed the progression. CNN reports Huntington's is caused by a single gene defect that causes cells to produce a toxic form of the huntingtin protein, which kills nerve cells in the brain. "You end up in almost a vegetative state," says a trial participant. Ionis-HTTRx prevents the toxic protein from being made. Some 46 patients in the early stages of the disease participated in the UK trial and received four spinal injections—either the drug or a placebo—a month apart. Trial leader Sarah Tabrizi calls it "probably the most significant moment in the history of Huntington’s since the gene [was isolated]. ... For the first time a drug has lowered the level of the toxic disease-causing protein in the nervous system, and the drug was safe and well-tolerated." But the trial needs to be bigger and longer, and that's what is happening next. If the findings are confirmed, Tabrizi envisions a future where those with the gene take the drug in a preventative manner. But the implications could be even bigger: "The drug's like Lego," says a neurologist involved in the trial. "You can target [any protein]," meaning applications for diseases like Alzheimer's may be possible.
Summary: A new drug called Ionis-HTTRx has shown promise in slowing the progression of Huntington's disease, a rare genetic disorder that affects nerve cells in the brain, by preventing the production of a toxic protein that causes the disease.
Story: – The supposed mission of Mattel's "I Can Be" Barbie book series is to empower girls to realize their career dreams. Hence the uproar over "I Can Be a Computer Engineer," which shows the iconic doll struggling to reboot her computer, then finding male coders to rescue her, Consumerist reports. The Random House book caught the eye of author Pamela Ribon—whose fiery take on the "misogynistic" tome was reprinted by Gizmodo—and Amazon reviewers, who gave the book at least 97 one-star reviews before it was yanked off the site yesterday, Consumerist notes. In the book, Barbie does such non-tech-savvy things as infecting her friend Skipper's laptop with a virus, which causes Skipper to lose her music files and homework. The two girls have a pillow fight, then Barbie goes to hunt down Steven and Brian to help her with her computer woes. The book was written by Susan Marenco, who handled many "I Can Be" books and worked for Microsoft for 10 years as a technical editor and "usability designer." She tells ABC News she thinks of herself as a feminist: "If I was on deadline, it's possible stuff slipped out or I quietly abided by Mattel without questioning it. Maybe I should have pushed back, and I usually I do, but I didn't this time." Reaction is predictably fierce, as Gizmodo notes, complete with a Tumblr parody and the Feminist Hacker Barbie site, where you can "fix" pages in the book to be more progressive. Mattel has apologized for the book, stating on the Barbie Facebook page that the book was first published in 2010, that it "doesn't reflect the Brand's vision for what Barbie stands for," and that the book series has been revamped since then.
Summary: Barbie's "I Can Be a Computer Engineer" book has sparked outrage for its portrayal of the iconic doll struggling to reboot her computer and seeking help from male coders, with critics accusing the book of perpetuating gender stereotypes and lacking feminist values.
Story: – Thursday night's GOP debate in South Carolina may have been the last good chance for low-polling candidates to shake things up a little—but while it was a feisty affair, it was short on surprises, with front-runners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz dominating. Here's what the pundits are saying about the candidates' performances: Donald Trump. Trump turned in a very strong performance, winning applause with a spirited response to Cruz's attack on "New York values." His "performances in these debates are never home runs—he's too undisciplined and unprepared for that," writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. "But, this was, without question his best debate." Ted Cruz. Analysts are split on whether Cruz or Trump came out on top, but the senator was an undeniable force to be reckoned with, and had one of the night's biggest moments when he went birther on Trump. At just over 18 minutes, he had the most speaking time of any of the seven candidates. Marco Rubio. While he was overshadowed by the Cruz-Trump fireworks, analysts say he turned in yet another solid debate performance. An attack on Cruz for flip-flopping in immigration did a lot to "firmly cement Mr Rubio as strongest candidate to represent the center-right of the establishment," according to Rob Crilly at the Telegraph. Chris Christie. It was a reasonably good night for Christie, who had some strong moments when sparring when Rubio, whom he told: "You already had your chance, Marco. You blew it." He "delivered the strongest debate performance of the establishment candidates as he touted his record as a governor and let his no-nonsense New Jersey spirit shine," writes Jeremy Diamond at CNN. Jeb Bush. It wasn't a terrible night for Bush, who sounded the most presidential despite his defeat appearing inevitable, writes Glenn Thrush at Politico. Bush served as a "reality check for a field ... which trucks in bombast, vagary and unsupported promises," he writes. John Kasich. Anybody who hoped this debate would provide the Ohio governor's breakout moment would have been disappointed. "He committed no real gaffes, but he delivered no memorable moments, either," writes Niall Stanage at the Hill. Ben Carson. This was the night Carson "surgically removed himself from contention," decides Thrush, who was far from the only analyst to call Carson the night's biggest loser. He spoke less than any other candidate and when he did, he seemed out of his depth, Cillizza writes. (Meanwhile, Rand Paul won the undercard debate ... by skipping it.)
Summary: In the South Carolina GOP debate, front-runners Donald Trump and Ted Cruz dominated, with Trump delivering a strong performance and Cruz going after Trump on his birther conspiracy theory.
Story: – This year's gathering in Cleveland promised to be the most unconventional GOP convention in decades, and Day 1 did not disappoint, although the Republican Party probably isn't entirely thrilled about how things are shaping up. Here are some of the winners and losers analysts named after the day's events. Among the winners: Donald Trump's ego. His entrance Thursday night, complete with a smoke machine and "We Are the Champions," was "epic," writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post, who says he has always wanted politics to be more like pro wrestling. Social conservatives. On Monday, the party adopted a platform that some are calling the most conservative ever, the AP reports. Christian conservatives praised it for being "the most pro-life platform ever," and for opposing same-sex marriage and bathroom choice for transgender individuals. They also loved this line: "Children raised in a traditional two-parent household tend to be physically and emotionally healthier, less likely to use drugs and alcohol, engage in crime, or become pregnant outside of marriage." Rudy Giuliani. The former New York City mayor delivered what was deemed one of the more impressive Day 1 speeches, reports the Huffington Post, which was particularly impressed by the fact that he didn't mention 9/11 once as he warned about America being in danger, though he did spend time talking about Benghazi. Richard Nixon. Looks like Nixon is back in fashion: Trump's allies "proudly portrayed him as the heir to Richard M. Nixon" and his "law and order" message, which appears to be Trump and the convention's main inspiration, according to the New York Times. Among the losers: Melania Trump. She was widely praised after a speech that touched on Trump's softer side, but her remarks were quickly overshadowed by accusations that she—or her speechwriters—had plagiarized Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Convention speech, the Hill reports. The Never Trump movement. There were angry scenes Monday as Trump opponents tried and failed to "unbind" delegates, making it a certainty that Trump will become the GOP nominee. Sen. Joni Ernst. The Iowan is a rising GOP star, Cillizza notes, but she wasn't scheduled to speak until after 11pm Eastern, long after Melania Trump spoke and the Quicken Loans Arena emptied, "meaning that the number of eyeballs on her were WAY fewer than she and her allies would have liked." The Republican Party. The discord and scheduling woes were enough for Politico, among others, to deem Day 1 "disastrous." Cleveland.com notes that the divisions were highlighted by the Trump campaign's attacks Monday on Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is skipping the convention.
Summary: The first day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland saw a mix of winners and losers, with Donald Trump's ego, social conservatives, and Rudy Giuliani emerging as winners, while Melania Trump, the Never Trump movement, and the Republican Party as a whole losing ground due to scheduling conflicts, plagiarism accusations, and internal divisions.
Story: – Whoever hired scantily dressed dancers for an Xbox party this week may be polishing his resume about now. A top executive at Microsoft, which owns Xbox, has called the decision "unacceptable" and promises a full investigation, the Seattle Times reports. "When we heard about this and saw the photos, the entire Senior Leadership Team was embarrassed and appalled," says Microsoft HR chief Kathleen Hogan in an email. "We are not going to tolerate this." The issue came to light in social media posts from the "invitation only" party Thursday at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, where photos and video showed the dancers in schoolgirl outfits, NBC Bay Area reports. "Thanks for pushing me out of this party, Microsoft," reads part of one tweet. "Very disappointed to see this," says another. The video game industry is already reputed to be a sexist "boys' club" where men hold more than 75% of the jobs and women are discouraged from seeking employment, the Wrap reports. CNET recalls that even Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, has said women should wait for raises rather than requesting them "because that's good karma." He later apologized, and Microsoft held a Women in Games luncheon earlier Thursday at the conference. As for the Xbox party, heads may yet roll: "That was unequivocally wrong and will not be tolerated," says Xbox chief Phil Spencer. "Let me be very clear ... who we hire and partner with and how we engage with others is a direct reflection of our brand and what we stand for." (A study shows that bad male gamers are more likely to harass women.)
Summary: Microsoft's Xbox division is under investigation after hiring scantily clad dancers for an invitation-only party at a gaming conference, with the company's HR chief calling the decision "unacceptable" and promising a full investigation, amidst a larger industry reputation for sexism and discrimination against women.
Story: – A Texas lawyer upset that he wasn't provided a cup of soup during a recent meal has notified a restaurant owner that he'll sue if not reimbursed the $2.25 for the soup, the AP reports. Dwain Downing also is seeking $250 in attorney fees for the time spent drafting a letter sent to Benji Arslanovski, who operates Our Place Restaurant in the Fort Worth suburb of Mansfield. Downing says the soup was listed on the menu as part of a Saturday special. He says the restaurant offered no discount or substitution when it ran out. The lawyer argued the menu amounts to a contract with the customer and Arslanovski violated the terms of the contract. But the restaurateur says the menu makes clear the soup comes with a meal "while supplies last." "I don’t want to make a big deal of this," Downing tells the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. But he says "it was a wrong and deceptive practice." Arslanovski then posted the lawyer's letter online, and it's been reposted by the Dallas Morning News. Per the letter, Downing went to the restaurant on April 16 and ordered the special, which included soup. Told they were out of soup, Downing requested a substitution or price reduction, but staff said that went against restaurant policy. "The menu is an offer for a contract by you," writes Downing. "You then breached the contract by not offering the soup as promised by you on the menu." Arslanovski sees it differently: "Isn’t it amazing?" he says. "This could have been solved with a simple phone call, and he could have come by and gotten a free cup of soup."
Summary: A Texas lawyer is threatening to sue a restaurant owner for $2.25 after he was not provided with a cup of soup during a recent meal, despite the menu listing it as part of a Saturday special, with the lawyer arguing that the menu amounts to a contract and the restaurant's policy of not offering substitutions or discounts when the soup runs out is a "wrong and deceptive practice."
Story: – Meryl Streep's now-famous speech at the Golden Globes had some perhaps unintended consequences, and one that was quite intended: the Committee to Protect Journalists saw a surge in donations that hasn't stopped after the actress called on viewers to open their wallets, the Huffington Post reports. Calling the outpouring "amazing," CPJ chief Joel Simon tells the Hollywood Reporter that 500 donations were posted Sunday night after Streep's plug, and a few hundred more poured into the New York nonprofit on Monday. "It's mostly average people based on the size of the donation, so that's really encouraging," he says. The CPJ aims mainly to protect reporters in war zones and countries where the press faces restriction—which hasn't historically been a domestic concern. Says Simon, "And now that gap has narrowed and we are facing a press freedom challenge at home." The CPJ's Courtney Radsch tells Poynter, "I don't think any of us were expecting such a ringing endorsement for our work and the right of journalists to report the news, which is our mission." (A list of people and things besides Streep that Donald Trump finds overrated.)
Summary: Meryl Streep's Golden Globes speech led to a surge in donations to the Committee to Protect Journalists, with 500 donations posted on Sunday night and a few hundred more on Monday, mostly from average people.
Story: – Hurricane Matthew gained new fury as it hammered the central Bahamas early Thursday, and forecasters say the life-threatening storm is expected to strengthen as it approaches Florida's Atlantic coast. The US National Hurricane Center in Miami says Matthew, though still a dangerous Category 3 hurricane as the day dawned, was expected to regain status as an even more powerful Category 4 storm in coming hours. The center extended a hurricane warning area on a large swath of Florida's east coast farther up to Altamaha Sound, Ga. In the latest developments: The storm is forecast to be near the Florida coast starting Thursday night, potentially as a Category 4 storm with 130mph winds, the AP reports. Any slight deviation could mean landfall or it heading farther out to sea. Either way, forecasters say it will come close enough to wreak havoc along the lower part of the East Coast, dumping up to 15 inches of rain in some spots. In South Carolina, Gov. Nikki Haley reversed the lanes of Interstate 26 for the first time on Wednesday so that all lanes of traffic were headed west and out of Charleston. Plans to reverse the lanes were put in place after hourslong traffic jams during Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Haley plans to call for more evacuations Thursday, which will bring the total to about 500,000 people in the state. Florida urged or ordered about 1.5 million to leave the coast, said Jackie Schutz, spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Scott. About 50,000 people were told to go in Georgia. The Miami Herald reports that Florida is bracing for its fiercest hurricane in more than a decade, with big lines at supermarkets and gas stations and school canceled for the rest of the week in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. The BBC reports that with roads impassable, bridges out, and phone lines down, Haiti is still trying to determine the damage from what is believed to be the worst disaster to hit the country since 2010's devastating earthquake. This weekend's presidential election has been postponed.
Summary: Hurricane Matthew is expected to strengthen into a Category 4 storm and make landfall along Florida's Atlantic coast, bringing life-threatening winds and rain to the area, with forecasters warning of potential devastation and evacuations underway in Florida, South Carolina, and Georgia.
Story: – A would-be thief in a Rio de Janeiro suburb apparently chose the wrong gym to rob, the AP reports. Surveillance camera footage shared widely on social media shows the man entering the gym and jumping a turnstile after arguing with the receptionist. Several seconds later, the man is seen jumping back over the turnstile and fleeing outside. He is chased by several jiujitsu students dressed in uniforms. Jiujitsu teacher Edgar Neto said the incident happened Monday night and he reported it to police. The man managed to escape. Police said Wednesday he hasn't been arrested, but they have recovered one of his sandals that fell off during the chase.
Summary: A would-be thief attempted to rob a gym in Rio de Janeiro, but was chased by jiujitsu students and managed to escape, with one of his sandals recovered by police.
Story: – David Bowie left behind quite a few iconic images, including this 1976 mugshot, deemed by BuzzFeed to be "the coolest mugshot of all time." Bowie was arrested at a hotel in downtown Rochester, NY, in March of that year after what would turn out to be his one and only performance in the city. The Democrat and Chronicle reprints its two original articles about the case: Bowie and three other people (Iggy Pop, a bodyguard, and a Rochester woman) were allegedly found with about a half-pound of marijuana; Bowie (who gave police his actual last name, Jones) paid bond for all of them after they spent a few hours in jail. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment a few days later, and the charges were basically dismissed when a grand jury decided not to indict him in May. As BuzzFeed explains, the ultra-glam mugshot wasn't taken in the wee hours of the morning Bowie & Co. were arrested, but rather when Bowie arrived at his arraignment. The 28-year-old star walked "silently ... through a crush of fans, police, and reporters"—and about six suspected prostitutes also awaiting arraignment—on his way into court, ignoring everyone "except for one teenager who got his autograph as he stepped off the escalator," the D&C article noted. As Open Culture recounts, Bowie was "looking dapper in his Thin White Duke clothing" at the arraignment—"a gray three-piece leisure suit and a pale brown shirt," with a "matching hat" that he carried, per the D&C. An auction house employee found the mugshot years later while going through a retired Rochester police officer's estate, and his brother sold it on eBay for $2,700 in 2007.
Summary: David Bowie was arrested in Rochester, NY in 1976 and photographed in a mugshot, which was later sold on eBay for $2,700, despite his plea of not guilty and eventual dismissal of charges.
Story: – John Kerry said today the US is sure that Bashar al-Assad gassed his own people in Syria, and that letting him go unpunished would set too dangerous a precedent for the world. The secretary of state said the US has "high confidence" in its intelligence and urged people to read an unclassified report released today. As for the comparisons to the run-up to Iraq in 2003, replete with faulty evidence: "We will not repeat that moment." The secretary of state said Assad has used chemical weapons "multiple times this year," and he asserted that the most recent high-profile assault on Damascus suburbs killed at least 1,429 people, including 426 children, reports AP. (He called Assad a "thug and murderer.") The question now isn't what we know, but "what are we and the world going to do about it?” said Kerry, per the New York Times. The US would continue making its case to Congress and the UN, but he said the White House is prepared to move forward with limited military action regardless. Sending a message on chemical weapons “matters deeply to the credibility and the future interests of the United States," he said. (At least France would be on board, notes Reuters.) Yes, Americans are tired of war, said Kerry. But "fatigue does not absolve us of our responsibility." Read the full transcript of his statement here. After Kerry spoke, President Obama made brief comments reiterating that the US is considering a "limited, narrow act" but that a final decision hasn't been made, reports the Washington Post. “We’re not considering any open-ended commitment," he said. "We are not considering any boots on the ground approach." (Meanwhile, is Assad's young son taunting the US on Facebook?)
Summary: John Kerry stated that the US has "high confidence" in its intelligence indicating that Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on his own people in Syria, and that the US will take limited military action if necessary to send a message on chemical weapons, despite fatigue from previous wars.
Story: – When it comes to the world's most-visited cities, Asia has a clear lead: Of the top five, four are on the continent, according to a list published by the Telegraph and based on a Euromonitor International report. The number one most-visited city? Hong Kong, which saw 23,770,200 international tourist arrivals in 2012.

Summary: Hong Kong is the world's most-visited city with 23.7 million international tourist arrivals in 2012, followed by three other Asian cities in the top five.
Story: – Amazon is experimenting with a 30-hour work week—but before you get too excited, consider that the employees will only earn 75% of what full-time employees earn. But they will be salaried and will get the same benefits as the 40-hour employees, the Washington Post reports. The pilot program, which was announced late last week, will involve entire technical teams (including managers) that work 30-hour weeks; in total, a few dozen employees will be a part of the experiment. Reactions: Quartz notes that Amazon has become "known for its soul-crushing work culture," and points out that a 30-hour work week could actually end up improving productivity: Studies have shown workers who put in fewer hours at the office are more productive. The Christian Science Monitor notes that Amazon is likely trying to draw more women to its workforce, as a more flexible work week could be attractive to mothers. At Forbes, Tim Worstall expands on that idea: "The gender pay gap is actually about children," he writes. "Never married no children women do not face a pay gap. The major cause is that in our society, rightly or wrongly, women take on, on average, the job of being primary caregiver to the partnership’s children more often than men do. ... Amazon has spotted a chance to get talent on the cheap as a result of other employers not offering child friendly, or child care friendly, working hours." Fortune says the move could also come in response to increasing automation in the industry, which is reducing the demand for human labor. An analyst tells the Post that, while many other companies have mentioned the desire to shorten the work week, not many have actually done anything about it. "There has for a very long time been a stigma against working reduced hours, or part-time work," she says, and hopefully Amazon's move can break that taboo.
Summary: Amazon is experimenting with a 30-hour work week for a select group of technical teams, with employees earning 75% of full-time pay, in an effort to potentially attract more women to its workforce and respond to automation in the industry, while breaking the stigma associated with part-time work.
Story: – The attorney general gave a speech to young conservatives Tuesday in which he mocked the way colleges are "coddling" students as part of a liberal movement. But attracting far more attention is that Jeff Sessions laughed along as the high school students in the audience began chanting, "Lock her up" in reference to Hillary Clinton—and then repeated the line himself. Politico sees it as a "remarkable" utterance from the nation's top law enforcement officer, though not all coverage was as concerned with it. A story on the speech by Fox News, for example, doesn't mention it. The chant began amid Sessions' ridicule of "supercilious snowflakes" on college campuses at the Turning Point USA High School Leadership Summit. "I like this bunch, I gotta tell ya, you’re not going to be backing down. Go get 'em! Go get 'em!" he told the group. The chant then began, and Sessions, chuckling, repeated the line once himself, adding, "I heard that a long time over the last campaign." The right-wing site Twitchy rounds up outraged reaction from "Twitter libs," including former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer, who said Session should resign immediately. "Wait a second," points out Twitchy. "Isn't this exactly what Donald Trump wants to happen, which could then trigger the end of the Mueller investigation?" (Before Sessions spoke, Nikki Haley had a much different message to the group: Enough with trying to "own the libs" in public discourse, she urged.)
Summary: Attorney General Jeff Sessions sparked controversy at a high school leadership summit by laughing along with students who chanted "Lock her up" in reference to Hillary Clinton, with some calling for his resignation and others suggesting it could potentially derail the Mueller investigation.
Story: – The search for a big wave surfer who went missing in Mexico this month has ended with the recovery of Adam Francis D'Esposito's body near the town of Rosarito, People reports. The body was reportedly found Sept. 9—a week after he went missing—but D'Esposito's family in the US was just notified Tuesday. "Our hearts are heavy as we come to terms with the fact that he is no longer with us," D'Esposito's sister, Briana, wrote in a Facebook post, describing her brother as "a very charismatic person with a big heart, passionate personality, and a deep love for surfing." Authorities in Mexico say D'Esposito drowned and there was no foul play. However, family members are unconvinced. Another sister, Mary, tells NBC San Diego that the 39-year-old D'Esposito was a strong swimmer who had spent some two decades surfing dangerous waves in Tahiti (at one point escaping unscathed from a shark attack). "It's very hard for us and many of his friends to believe he would just drown," she says. "It seems like there has to be more to the story that led him to that point." D'Esposito, who lived across the border in Carlsbad, was reportedly in Mexico visiting his father. On Sept. 2, he took his dad's station wagon out. A local surf shop owner said he saw D'Esposito two days later without a shirt or shoes, acting as if he was being followed. D'Esposito, the father of a young daughter, had recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, his sisters say. "With various sightings, the condition he was in, the paranoia, the fear he had, I feel we owe it to him to put together a timeline," Briana tells NBC San Diego. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help transport D'Esposito's body to the US, help with funeral expenses, and benefit his daughter.
Summary: Adam Francis DEsposito, a 39-year-old big wave surfer who went missing in Mexico, was found dead near the town of Rosarito, with authorities saying he drowned but his family expressing skepticism due to his strong swimming ability and recent diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
Story: – A Pennsylvania tree trimmer is incredibly lucky to be alive after an accident that left him with a chainsaw blade embedded in his neck. James Valentine, 21, was pruning trees when the saw kicked back and hit him in the neck, the AP reports. His colleagues removed the motor but left the blade—which missed major arteries but cut into muscle—in place to prevent further blood loss. He is expected to make a full recovery and the trauma surgeon who operated on him says he was about as calm as you could expect a man with a chainsaw in his neck to be. "He was appropriately upset, but his death was not imminent," the surgeon tells Reuters. "He didn't lose control, he wasn't crying uncontrollably, and he was holding still as best he could." She says it was an encouraging sign that he was still able to speak when he arrived at the hospital and though he was able to provide a brief medical history, "We certainly don't ask him 'How do you feel about having a chainsaw stuck in your neck?'"
Summary: A Pennsylvania tree trimmer is expected to make a full recovery after a chainsaw accident left a blade embedded in his neck, with doctors praising his calm demeanor during the ordeal.
Story: – Score one for the little guy in a fight against the banking industry—a 16-year fight to be exact. The Supreme Court in London has ruled in favor of a 44-year-old man who got severely penalized over a small loan for a laptop that he never actually owned, reports the Guardian. Richard Durkin's case began in 1998 when he bought a $2,400 laptop at a store called PC World. He put $50 down and signed a credit deal with HFC Bank, a division of HSBC, which handled the store's in-store financing. Durkin returned the laptop the next day, as he was told he could do, when he discovered it didn't have the appropriate modem. The store (eventually) returned his deposit. The bank? Not so much. HFC insisted that Durkin still had to honor his loan payments on the laptop he didn't possess. He refused, and the bank destroyed his credit rating in turn, reports the BBC. Durkin won about $13,000 in damages, though he estimates that he's out far more than that because of his lousy credit. He says, for instance, that he was unable to buy a home. "It's victory, but they didn't have jurisdiction to help me in the end, which is disappointing," he says. "But I'm pleased for the consumer. A lot of people will benefit from this—it's massive." Both stories suggest that his victory could pave the way for others to challenge their credit ratings in court.
Summary: A 44-year-old man, Richard Durkin, won a 16-year legal battle against a bank after being penalized for a loan he never actually owned, with the Supreme Court ruling in his favor and potentially paving the way for others to challenge their credit ratings in court.
Story: – The White House has for the first time promised to release the death toll of civilian and non-civilian casualties from US drone strikes going back to 2009, reports the Guardian. Or at least some drone strikes: The disclosure won't cover those in areas of "active hostilities" such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria. Instead, it will include those in places such as Libya, Somalia, Pakistan, and Yemen. President Obama's counterterrorism adviser, Lisa Monaco, told the Council on Foreign Relations on Monday that a tally of alleged terrorists and civilians killed in such strikes since 2009 would be made available in the "coming weeks." She added that the "figures will be provided annually," per Politico, though it remains to be seen if the next president will support the move. Monaco said the disclosure may include tallies compiled by non-government groups; one such tally released in 2014 found that the US killed 1,147 people in Pakistan and Yemen while targeting 41 known men. But "it's not enough to tally up the drones' body count. We need a thorough reassessment of the program itself," says an attorney for drone strike victims. On Friday, a Justice Department official agreed to release "a much more detailed explanation of the standards and procedures employed in both capture and lethal targeting counter-terrorism operations," in response to a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union. (The news comes just days after US strikes killed 150 suspected militants in Somalia.)
Summary: The White House has promised to release the death toll of civilian and non-civilian casualties from US drone strikes since 2009, excluding areas of "active hostilities" such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, with the first tally to be released in the "coming weeks" and potentially including tallies compiled by non-government groups.
Story: – Social networking has already changed our lives; now, officials want us to consider its implications after our death. On its blog, the US government is calling on Americans to create "social media wills," which detail our wishes for the future of the huge range of online accounts we all have these days. Email and Facebook are just the beginning: The average person has 25 password-protected accounts, a law professor tells Mashable. About half a million Facebook users reportedly died last year. Because a Facebook account, for example, can act as an interactive memorial, the social media will raises entirely different questions from a traditional will, Mashable notes. "Just like a traditional will helps your survivors handle your physical belongings, a social media will spells out how you want your online identity to be handled," the blog post says, urging people to appoint "online executors" who "will be responsible for closing your email addresses, social media profiles, and blogs after you are deceased."
Summary: The US government is urging Americans to create "social media wills" to detail their wishes for the management of their online accounts after death, including email, Facebook, and other password-protected accounts, which can act as interactive memorials and raise unique questions beyond traditional wills.
Story: – HBO chief Richard Plepler said earlier this year that people swiping HBO Go passwords from family or friends to watch their favorite shows and movies was not a big deal, but he may want to rethink that business concession. A new report by Parks Associates and cited by Consumerist shows that 6% of US households are using someone else's account to watch a streaming-video service (think HBO Go, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime)—and that programming pilfering will cost the industry $500 million this year. Young adults ages 18-24 use OTT (over-the-top) video services paid for by someone else the most, with 20% copping to it, per The Cost of Piracy report. Those numbers keep dropping (e.g., only 10% of the 25-34 set admit to this activity), until they rise slightly in the 55-64 demographic, which Consumerist notes could be from older parents using their adult children's accounts. "Credential sharing has a measurable impact on video services," a Parks Associates analyst says in the release. "The impact on OTT video revenues is especially troublesome as OTT providers are investing large sums of money to boost their original content offerings." The company notes that a previous study of college students found little guilt or embarrassment present when using a "borrowed" password. Consumerist notes that while Netflix makes it relatively easy for different people to use the same password (its highest-level service plan allows for content to be streamed on four screens at once), other services like Hulu limit streaming to one device at a time, which limits the hit the service takes. (If you are using someone else's HBO Go password, don't whine about it when things go wrong.)
Summary: According to a new report, 6% of US households are using someone else's account to watch streaming services such as HBO Go, Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime, resulting in an estimated $500 million loss for the industry this year, with young adults ages 18-24 being the most likely to engage in this behavior.
Story: – The city of La Cruces, NM, has agreed to pay $3 million to settle a federal civil lawsuit brought by a woman who was sexually assaulted by a police detective when she was a high-school intern with the department. During the trial, Diana Guerrero, who had aspired to become a police officer, told the court, "It had never occurred to me that a person who had earned a badge would do this," the AP reports, noting Guerrero agreed to be named. According to a Justice Department press release, former Las Cruces police Detective Michael Garcia took Guerrero, then 17, on a ride-along to visit a crime scene in May 2011. Rather than take her directly back to the station, he "drove her to a secluded location where he sexually assaulted her." The press release notes he was "assigned to a unit that focused on child abuse and sex crimes investigations" at the time. Garcia, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to nine years in prison in late 2014. Guerrero reported the assault, which left her feeling "like a piece of trash" in 2013, after bumping into a female detective that year who asked why she had ended the internship. "I just blurted it out," Guerrero told KVIA. "I am most happy and satisfied that this lawsuit brought to light a cesspool of sexual violence and harassment that exists in police departments across this country," Guerrero tells the AP. Indeed, an investigation by the news outlet found that, during a six-year period, about 1,000 officers were fired for a range of sex crimes; it calls that number "unquestionably an undercount." The City Council still has to approve the settlement, according to KRWG, which is expected to happen Monday. KVIA reports Guerrero now intends to pursue a career in nutrition.
Summary: A former Las Cruces, NM police detective was sentenced to 9 years in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting a 17-year-old high school intern during a ride-along, and the city has agreed to pay $3 million to settle a federal civil lawsuit brought by the victim.
Story: – Police forces across America have become "dangerously militarized" and are using equipment and tactics taken straight from the Army to do things like serve search warrants and search homes for drugs, a new American Civil Liberties Union report finds. Among the findings of the report on police militarization, as per NPR, the Guardian, and the Washington Post: SWAT teams were designed for hostage situations, but almost 80% of the raids studied were to serve a search warrant. Some 62% of the total were for drug searches—and just 7% were for "hostage, barricade, or active shooter scenarios." Almost two-thirds of SWAT raids resulted in forced entry into a private home, whether by battering ram, boot, or explosive device. No contraband at all was found in at least 36% of raids, and the ACLU says this figure could be as high as 65%. In raids where the stated purpose of using a SWAT team was the possibility of a weapon being present, a weapon was found just 35% of the time. Black people and other minorities were disproportionately targeted by the SWAT raids. With the help of federal funds, "state and local law enforcement agencies have amassed military arsenals purportedly to wage the failed War on Drugs, the battlegrounds of which have disproportionately been in communities of color," an ACLU spokeswoman says. "But these arsenals are by no means free of cost for communities." The Pentagon has channeled huge amounts of equipment used in Iraq and Afghanistan to local police forces, including hundreds of armored personnel carriers. "If the federal government gives the police a huge cache of military-style weaponry, they are highly likely to use it, even if they do not really need to," the ACLU says. The report cited numerous incidents where the use of a SWAT team appears to have caused unnecessary injuries, including a 2010 case in Detroit where a 7-year-old girl was shot dead after police threw a flash grenade into her home, burning her. More recently, a 19-month-old boy in Georgia is still fighting for his life after police threw a flash grenade into his playpen during a drug raid last month. Police later found the suspect they were looking for at a different house, and he surrendered peacefully.
Summary: According to an ACLU report, police forces in the US have become increasingly militarized, using tactics and equipment from the military to conduct routine tasks such as serving search warrants and drug raids, with disproportionate targeting of minority communities and a high rate of unnecessary injuries and damage to property.
Story: – A hiker has been killed in Washington state after being swept away by rushing river waters inside Mount Rainier National Park, per the AP. Park officials on Sunday said the woman was swept away Wednesday while attempting to cross the West Fork of the White River while hiking the Northern Loop Trail. The News-Tribune reports that the Pierce County medical examiner identified the woman as 22-year-old Qing Yue, a Chinese national who was attending college in the United States. Other hikers watched the woman get swept away but could not locate her. A ground crew found her body Friday with assistance from a King County Sheriff's Office helicopter after an initial aerial search failed to find her. "River crossings can be extremely hazardous this time of year,” Mount Rainier Superintendent Chip Jenkins said in a press release. “These cold, swift-flowing waters require a high level of caution, even for those hikers with extensive experience, knowledge and skills.”
Summary: A 22-year-old Chinese national hiker, Qing Yue, was killed in Washington state's Mount Rainier National Park after being swept away by rushing river waters while hiking the Northern Loop Trail, with park officials warning of the hazards of river crossings this time of year.
Story: – If today's school shooting in Oregon seemed numbingly familiar, here's why: A group that advocates for gun-control measures counts it as the 74th school shooting in the 18 months since the Newtown massacre, reports the Washington Post. Here is the full list of shootings from Everytown for Gun Safety. Included is any incident in which a gun was fired inside a school or on its campus, even if by accident. Today's shooting comes less than a week after the fatal shooting at Seattle Pacific University. The topic came up today as President Obama fielded questions on Tumblr, and Obama said the US "should be ashamed" about its gun violence, reports USA Today. "We're the only developed country on Earth where this happens," he said. "And it happens now once a week." Obama said his "biggest frustration so far is that this society has not been willing to take some basic steps to keep guns out of the hands of people who can do just unbelievable damage,” reports Politico. He again criticized Congress for caving to the gun lobby and urged people to step up pressure on their lawmakers.
Summary: A group that tracks school shootings has counted 74 incidents in the past 18 months, including today's shooting in Oregon, which comes less than a week after a fatal shooting at Seattle Pacific University, and President Obama has expressed frustration with the US's high rate of gun violence, citing the need for stricter gun control measures.
Story: – John McCain recently went on MSNBC and called Kim Jong Un a "crazy fat kid," and North Korea is taking it pretty well. Just kidding—the country's Foreign Ministry put out a statement calling McCain's words a "grave provocation little short of declaration of war." The statement says Pyongyang "will take steps to counter" McCain's words, which hurt the country's "dignity," the Daily Intelligencer reports. The statement went on to call McCain and fellow senator Ted Cruz (North Korea is mad at him because he wants to re-list the country as a state sponsor of terrorism) the equivalent of puppies who have "no fear of the tiger." "The revolutionary forces of the DPRK with its nuclear force for as its pivot will ... [deal] a merciless sledge-hammer blow at those daring [to] hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership," the statement reads. McCain's response, on Twitter: "What, did they want me to call him a crazy skinny kid?" But at the Washington Post, Anna Fifield doesn't think McCain should be so smug. It's not only wrong but dangerous to peg Kim as crazy, she writes, citing North Korea experts. The fact that his family's regime is still in power is just part of the evidence that Kim is not the joke many make him out to be; he has stayed in power in part by purging elites who are disloyal and keeping the rest in fear that they could be next. The bottom line remains that North Korea has nukes, and Kim "has overseen steady improvements" in the country's missile program. He may want his enemies to think he's crazy, a strategy that has been employed by leaders from Machiavelli to Richard Nixon, but to actually believe that could be "playing into his hands."
Summary: North Korea responded to John McCain's comment calling Kim Jong Un a "crazy fat kid" by labeling it a "grave provocation" and threatening to take "merciless" action against those who hurt the country's dignity.
Story: – Beatles drummer Ringo Starr is now Sir Ringo Starr. The musician was knighted Tuesday in honor of his services to music, the BBC reports. "It means a lot actually," Starr said after the ceremony at Buckingham Palace in which Prince William bestowed the honor upon him. "It means recognition for the things we've done. I was really pleased to accept this." As for his medal—which comes 53 years after the Beatles were honored with Member of The Order of The British Empire medals in 1965—Starr, 77, says, "I'll be wearing it at breakfast." Fellow Beatle Paul McCartney was knighted 21 years ago. TMZ notes other big-name musicians who've been knighted include Elton John, Rod Stewart, and Mick Jagger.
Summary: Ringo Starr was knighted by Prince William at Buckingham Palace for his services to music, with the Beatles drummer expressing gratitude and stating he will wear the medal at breakfast.
Story: – An Army National Guard pilot is dead, and his brother paralyzed from the waist down, after the plane they were hoping to use to scatter their late father's ashes crashed into a Massachusetts pond. On leave from a tour of duty in Kosovo, pilot Scott Landis, 34, had taken to the skies with his brother, 29-year-old Patrick Landis, to spread the ashes over a cranberry bog, reports the Boston Herald. However, the single-engine plane crashed into a pond near Hanson's Cranland Airport around 4pm. The airport owner cites "engine failure on takeoff," per NECN. "The engine started slowing down, and [Scott] started to turn to come back, and then you heard the engine drop off." "We are all confident that he did the best that he thought he could do" given the altitude and speed, a friend adds. "It just didn't work out." It took 15 minutes to free the men, who were trapped in water, as first responders used "sawzalls and hand tools to remove part of the aircraft," reports NBC Boston. Scott, who reportedly borrowed the plane from its owner, was pronounced dead at a hospital, leaving behind a wife and 16-month-old son who are to receive more than $63,000 raised through a GoFundMe campaign. His brother, who may never walk again, suffered "a broken back and severed spinal cord," his aunt writes on a separate GoFundMe page that has raised $17,000, per People. The Herald reports his injuries also include two broken collarbones, a broken leg, and two collapsed lungs. Other pilots have offered to complete the sons' mission to spread the ashes, which were recovered unopened. Their father died of lung cancer.
Summary: An Army National Guard pilot, Scott Landis, and his brother Patrick were involved in a fatal plane crash while scattering their late father's ashes in Massachusetts, with Scott dying in the crash and Patrick suffering severe injuries including paralysis from the waist down.
Story: – Sorority members at the University of Virginia are taking a stand over a rule they argue is rooted in discrimination. This Saturday is bid night at UVa campus fraternities, an event in which the sorority sisters normally take part—but this year, national chapters are requiring many of them to avoid the parties, the Washington Post reports. The national chapters' decision follows the death of a student as well as allegations of gang rape at a fraternity house. Though those allegations were later said to be unsubstantiated, the university has taken a hard look at safety on campus, the Post notes. Now, some women are even banned from participating in events with fraternity members off-campus that night. Says the National Panhellenic Organization that oversees Greek life: "NPC supports the safety of their women, so they do support those national presidents making that decision and encouraging sorority women to plan sisterhood events and other ‘safer’ options." A letter to the NPC gives voice to those opposed to the policy: "Sorority women are being used as leverage to change the actions and behaviors of fraternity men," it reads. "This resolution has misconstrued us as a passive aggregate rather than active agents for change." Meanwhile, an online petition to revoke the ban has gathered more than 2,000 signatures. The school's Student Council yesterday passed a resolution calling on the national groups to change the mandate, the Cavalier Daily reports.
Summary: Sorority members at the University of Virginia are protesting a rule requiring them to avoid fraternity parties on bid night, citing concerns of discrimination and being used as leverage for change.
Story: – Big news in cancer research Wednesday: Sean Parker, the founder of Napster and a co-founder of Facebook, is giving $250 million to six leading cancer centers so they can collaborate on immunotherapy in what Fortune calls "unprecedented" fashion. The nitty gritty: The new Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy will bring together about 300 scientists and 40 labs at the six centers, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and Stanford. The AP has more basics. The idea is to fund "high-risk best ideas that may not get funded by the government," Jeffrey Bluestone, who will lead the institute, tells USA Today. This is the biggest donation ever for immunotherapy and one of the biggest for cancer, period, but a post at MIT Technology Review takes a look at why "Parker's money alone won't defeat cancer." One of Parker's big ideas is that the institute itself will manage the patents and negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry to bring therapies to market, while the centers themselves will retain the intellectual property, reports the Washington Post. Immunotherapy involves harnessing the body's own immune system to fight cancer cells, and "it's hard to overstate how hot" the field is right now, reports Wired. SFGate explains why immunotherapy is a personal issue for the 36-year-old Parker, who has long suffered food allergies and asthma. Parker's net worth is estimated to be $2.4 billion, reports the New York Times.
Summary: Sean Parker, the founder of Napster and a co-founder of Facebook, has donated $250 million to six leading cancer centers to collaborate on immunotherapy research through the new Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, with a focus on funding high-risk, innovative ideas and managing patents to bring therapies to market.
Story: – With Elsa dolls dethroning the likes of Barbie, it's perhaps no surprise that there are whispers of a Frozen sequel, and star Adele Dazeem, ahem, Idina Menzel, says there's truth in those rumors, reports Time. In an interview with the Telegraph, Menzel says that the movie sequel and a Broadway version are "all in the works," and that while she won't star in "the stage show—I don't know what will happen with that—but the movie hopefully. We'll see. I'm just going along for the ride." There's also reportedly a new short coming.
Summary: Adele Dazeem (Idina Menzel) confirms that a Frozen sequel and Broadway version are in the works, with Menzel possibly not starring in the stage show but possibly reprising her role in the movie.
Story: – As southern Sudan votes on a secession referendum Jan. 9, sparking fears of a new civil war with the north, someone will be watching: George Clooney. And the actor hopes you’ll watch, too, via his new Satellite Sentinel Project website, the AP reports. The idea: Train a bunch of cameras on Sudan in an effort to spotlight the region—and hopefully halt genocide and war crimes. “We are the anti-genocide paparazzi,” Clooney tells Time. The project, a joint effort with Google, the UN, and anti-genocide organizations, will provide real-time satellite surveillance of the border, because “it’s a lot harder to commit mass atrocities in the glare of the media spotlight,” and Clooney wants Sudanese leaders “to enjoy the level of celebrity attention that I usually get,” he says. “This is as if this were 1943 and we had a camera inside Auschwitz and we said, 'OK, if you guys don't want to do anything about it, that's one thing. But you can't say you did not know.’”
Summary: George Clooney is using his Satellite Sentinel Project, a joint effort with Google, the UN, and anti-genocide organizations, to provide real-time satellite surveillance of Sudan in an effort to halt genocide and war crimes by training cameras on the region and shining a media spotlight on it.
Story: – The New Year's Eve attacks on women in Germany were much more widespread than originally reported. Though police initially identified about 30 suspects in Cologne, a Federal Criminal Police Agency document—obtained by a German newspaper—reveals that an estimated 2,000 men were responsible for attacks on 1,200 women throughout the country on New Year's Eve. Only 120 suspects have been identified so far, with about half of them being foreign nationals, reports Deutsche Welle. Just four men have been convicted, though trials are ongoing, reports the Washington Post. "We have to presume that many of those crimes will never be fully investigated," says the president of the German Federal Crime Police Office. Most of the attacks were done by men moving in large groups, and low CCTV coverage and poor descriptions make identifying suspects difficult, he adds. The document reports that 650 women were attacked in Cologne and another 400 in Hamburg. Assaults were also reported in Düsseldorf and Stuttgart. The GFCP president says there is "no evidence" that the attacks were coordinated. (This new law could lead to more rape convictions in Germany.)
Summary: In the New Year's Eve attacks on women in Germany, an estimated 2,000 men were responsible for attacks on 1,200 women throughout the country, with only 120 suspects identified and four convicted, despite poor CCTV coverage and difficulty identifying suspects due to large groups and poor descriptions.
Story: – It was "attack Rick Perry night" at last night's GOP debate in Florida-—to the extent that even Jon Huntsman got in on the act—and the Texan's rivals succeeded in landing a few blows. Mitt Romney, who wisely ignored the Tea Party debate audience to focus on people watching on CNN, and Michele Bachmann, who tore into Perry over the HPV vaccination issue, emerged from the debate stronger, decides Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. David Catanese at Politico, meanwhile, picks another debate winner: the Tea Party movement. The "rabidly partisan" crowd, which cold-shouldered Huntsman and booed Perry over immigration and Ron Paul over foreign policy, made it clear that any Republican aiming for the White House won't be able to make it without the movement's backing, he writes.
Summary: At last night's GOP debate in Florida, Mitt Romney and Michele Bachmann emerged stronger after landing blows on Rick Perry, while the Tea Party movement demonstrated its influence as a key factor in any Republican presidential candidate's success.
Story: – A man arrested at 16 for allegedly stealing a backpack, then held at Rikers Island for three years—two of which he spent in solitary confinement—until his case was dismissed in 2013, committed suicide on Saturday. He was 22. Kalief Browder was starved and beaten by officers and inmates while in prison and attempted suicide several times, including after he left. His experience helped reform the municipal court system. "I'm mentally scarred right now," he told the New Yorker last year. "There are certain things that changed about me and they might not go back." He hanged himself out of a hole in an upstairs wall, meant to hold an air conditioner, in the home he shared with his parents. His mother heard a noise but found nothing upstairs. "It wasn't until she went outside to the backyard and looked up that she realized that her youngest child had hanged himself," reports the New Yorker. "Ma, I can't take it anymore," Browder had told her a day earlier. "Kalief, you've got a lot of people in your corner," she told him. Among them were Jay Z and Rosie O'Donnell, who once invited Browder to dinner and gave him a MacBook Air. "I think what caused the suicide was his incarceration and those hundreds and hundreds of nights in solitary confinement, where there were mice crawling up his sheets in that little cell," Browder’s lawyer, Paul Prestia, tells the Los Angeles Times. "Being starved, and not being taken to the shower for two weeks at a time ... those were direct contributing factors." Prestia, who had filed a lawsuit against New York City on Browder's behalf, says the case was nearing a settlement. "He didn't get tortured in some prison camp in another country," he adds. "It was right here!" As of March, some 400 people had spent at least two years in prison in the city without a conviction, the New York Times reports. Six at Rikers had been waiting at least six years on pending cases.
Summary: Kalief Browder, a young man who was arrested at 16 and held at Rikers Island for three years, including two in solitary confinement, before his case was dismissed in 2013, died by suicide at the age of 22, with his incarceration and time in solitary confinement cited as contributing factors.
Story: – The crime beat is getting a little too real for TV reporters in Oakland. Last night, KTVU reporter Heather Holmes was doing a live report about a mugging that occurred earlier in the day when someone broke into the station's news van and stole her purse, reports KCBS. The kicker is that the van itself was parked in front of Oakland's police headquarters, as Holmes noted in a tweet of disbelief. But maybe it shouldn't be all that surprising: The San Francisco Chronicle reports that the TV crews have become such regular victims in Oakland that stations frequently send them out with security guards in tow. (Otherwise, they might end up losing a camera or two, even in broad daylight.)
Summary: A TV reporter in Oakland had her purse stolen from the news van while reporting live in front of the police headquarters, highlighting the growing concern among TV crews about safety in the city.
Story: – Next up in DC: House and Senate Budget Committee leaders have until Dec. 13 to agree upon a budget plan and ensure the whole mess doesn't happen again. Both sides say they're intent on avoiding another shutdown, and the New York Times reports on how they'll do so: by lowering their expectations. That means no "grand bargain." House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan met with his Democratic counterpart in the Senate, Patty Murray, for breakfast yesterday along with two other budget leaders; in total, there are 29 lawmakers on the budget conference committee, and a series of meetings are planned, the Wall Street Journal reports. But aides didn't sound all that hopeful of finding a budget compromise both parties are happy with. The Democratic budget for the year that began Oct. 1 includes $1.058 trillion in spending; the Republican budget is at $967 billion. The Republican number factors in the next round of automatic sequester cuts, due to hit Jan. 15, the Washington Post reports. But both parties want to avoid those cuts and instead replace them with savings elsewhere. But with expectations lowered, forget a deal on major items like tax revenues or entitlement programs: The main items on the bargaining table are reductions in things like farm subsidies, federal pensions, unemployment insurance, and the USPS, plus small tax-loophole closings.
Summary: House and Senate Budget Committee leaders are working to avoid another government shutdown by Dec. 13 by lowering their expectations and focusing on reducing spending on specific areas such as farm subsidies, federal pensions, unemployment insurance, and tax loopholes.
Story: – Environmentalists are going to hate this one: A State Department review of the controversial Keystone oil pipeline raises no major environmental objections, reports the New York Times. The report concludes that the proposed pipeline from Canada to Texas would not affect global greenhouse gas emissions in a significant way, reports the Washington Post. This doesn't mean the project is now a slam-dunk, but the environmental assessment was seen as one of its biggest remaining hurdles. President Obama has said that he would sign off on the pipeline only if it didn't "significantly exacerbate" carbon pollution, and the report seems to satisfy that requirement. So what's next? John Kerry and his State Department now must consider other factors beyond the environment—the economic impact, relations with Canada, etc.—in making a final decision. As one State official tells the Post: The report "does not answer the broader question about how a decision on this potential pipeline fits in with broader national and international efforts to address climate change and climate priorities or other questions of foreign policy or energy security." Eight separate agencies have three months to weigh in, reports the Wall Street Journal.
Summary: The State Department's review of the Keystone oil pipeline found no major environmental objections, but the project's impact on global greenhouse gas emissions is still being evaluated in a broader review of its implications for national and international efforts to address climate change and foreign policy priorities.
Story: – Amazon can expect to send fewer packages to Saudi Arabia in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder. Thousands of social media users in the country are urging a boycott of Amazon.com and Dubai-based subsidiary Souq.com over coverage of the writer's killing published by the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. On Friday, for example, the Post published an op-ed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said the "inexplicable" killing in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul was ordered by "the highest levels of the Saudi government." CNN reports the boycott was mentioned in more than 8,000 tweets Monday—it was one of the top trending hashtags in Saudi Arabia, per the Hill—though Bloomberg found several tweets "appeared to be automated or copied and pasted." Noting the use of pro-government bots to promote certain messages, the Post likewise describes "similar if not identical language, suggesting some degree of coordination." Still, some users appeared serious, sharing images of the Amazon app deleted from smartphones, per Bloomberg. Describing an "organized media war" in which the Post "consistently publishes articles that are defaming," Saudi journalist Bandar Otyf urged his followers to "boycott Amazon to send a message to its owner so he is aware of the scale of the damage." Another user said it was unacceptable that the Post "attacks our nation and its leaders." One man found some hypocrisy in the whole idea, however. "Amazon's owner has a stake in Twitter, so if you were serious, then boycott Twitter too," he wrote, per CNN. (Saudis who assisted in an investigation into the killing allegedly hid evidence.)
Summary: Saudi Arabian social media users are calling for a boycott of Amazon and its subsidiary Souq.com in response to the Washington Post's coverage of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which is owned by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, with some users deleting the Amazon app from their smartphones and accusing the Post of defaming their nation and leaders.
Story: – The Bernie Sanders campaign has launched the most talked-about ad of the 2016 election season to date—"America," set to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's song of the same name. A roundup of coverage: Is it really "the most important campaign ad since President Reagan's 'Morning in America' ad?" This blogger makes the case for the spot at the Hill because of its mixture of "romance" and substance. The Observer suggests that the real meaning of this "bittersweet" protest tune might not be what the Sanders campaign thinks it is. The spot illustrates a contrast in campaigns: Sanders is "pushing inspiration," while Hillary Clinton is "talking in more practical terms." The Christian Science Monitor digs in. This blogger at Gateway Pundit hates it: The first glimpse of a minority comes in the 18th scene. Clinton ally David Brock picks up on that theme, as reported in this AP story. "It seems black lives don't matter much to Bernie Sanders." AdWeek is a fan, especially because of the ad's lack of words, but wonders whether the 1968 song might date the 74-year-old Sanders. As an Iowa resident deluged with ads, Josh Voorhees at Slate is pretty happy with this one, "a welcome break from the usual campaign promises and stale warnings." What do Simon and Garfunkel think? The latter gave his approval, while Simon hasn't commented, reports Variety. The Sanders campaign says the song's use—all properly legal—isn't meant to signal an endorsement from the pair.
Summary: Bernie Sanders' campaign ad "America," set to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's song of the same name, has generated buzz and contrasted with other campaigns by emphasizing inspiration over practicality, with some praising its romantic and substance-filled message and others criticizing its lack of diversity and potential datedness.
Story: – North Carolina is hunkering down for another big storm, and more than 100,000 of its residents are without power and hundreds of flights have been canceled as Winter Storm Diego rolled through on Sunday, reports CNN. Another 100,000 have lost power in South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. American Airlines canceled 1,100 flights out of its Charlotte hub on Sunday, which will have ripple effects on connecting flights, reports USA Today. Some 300 flights have been canceled on Monday. "This storm comes at a time of year when North Carolinians are usually hearing carols about snow, not actually seeing it. But this time, the real thing is headed our way and North Carolina is getting prepared," said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper in a statement. About a foot of snow is expected in southern and central Appalachia, notes CNN, though totals could top 20 inches by Monday. "Snowfall amounts in some locations will likely exceed a foot and result in several days of difficult or impossible travel, extended power outages, and downed trees," the National Weather Service said.
Summary: Winter Storm Diego has left over 100,000 residents in North Carolina without power and canceled over 1,100 flights out of Charlotte Airport, with up to 20 inches of snow expected in southern and central Appalachia.
Story: – Where's the love? A new website called IJustMadeLove.com will tell you—with precise, digitally-guided detail. The site uses GPS technology and Google Maps to allow anonymous users to chart where, exactly, people are getting it on. Users can also let the world know whether their lovemaking was homo or hetero, indoor or outdoor—or for that matter, whether it took place on land, at sea, or the back of a car. There are even stick figures to denote positions. But this isn't porn, per se. Founder Cyprian Cieckiewicz, a 26-year-old programmer from Warsaw, wanted to keep things clean. "We didn't name the site I Just Had Sex or anything like that," he says. "We're trying to keep the site really nice." Nice enough for his parents to test drive, he says. "Older people make love, too." To date 77,900 encounters have been recorded. That includes Cieckiewicz's own entries, the Daily Beast notes.
Summary: A new website called IJustMadeLove.com uses GPS technology and Google Maps to allow anonymous users to chart their sexual locations and activities, including the positions and orientations, with the option to specify whether it was hetero or homo, indoor or outdoor, and even on land, sea, or a vehicle.
Story: – Ohio Gov. John Kasich does not love the Islamic State and does not intend to hold President Trump accountable "for every drop of blood flowing in Muslim countries," but that's the message that greeted visitors to his website Sunday. The Republican governor's website was among numerous Ohio state sites hacked over the weekend by a group calling itself Team System DZ, the BBC reports. Kasich's website was back to normal later Sunday, as was that of the Ohio Department of Medicaid, though others, including the websites of Ohio First Lady Karen Kasich and the Ohio Department of Corrections, were still down for maintenance early Monday. The governor's hacked website displayed the pro-ISIS message on a black background as the Muslim call to prayer played, CNN reports. "All affected servers have been taken offline and we are investigating how these hackers were able to deface these websites," Tom Hoyt, a spokesman for Ohio's Department of Administrative Services, said in a statement, per the Cincinnati Enquirer. He said law enforcement is also investigating. The hack should be a wake-up call for "freedom-loving Americans," tweeted state treasurer Josh Mandel. "Radical Islam infiltrating the heartland." (Cyber-sleuths warn that President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate and other properties would be easy targets for hackers.)
Summary: The website of Ohio Gov. John Kasich was hacked and displayed a message supporting the Islamic State, despite Kasich's lack of love for the group, as part of a larger hacking attack on several Ohio state websites.
Story: – Hillary Clinton sits down with People magazine for a cover story, and the one media outlet you think might let The Subject of Unending Speculation go, in fact does not. "I know I have a decision to make," she says of making a second run for the Oval Office. "But part of what I've been thinking about, is everything I'm interested in and everything I enjoy doing—and with the extra added joy of 'I'm about to become a grandmother,' I want to live in the moment." But "I am concerned about what I see happening in the country and in the world." More from her interview: On the Oval Office's glass ceiling: "I think it reflects a desire on the part of a lot of Americans, not just women, that we have unfinished business. I’m certainly in the camp that says we need to break down that highest, hardest glass ceiling in American politics. To have a woman president is something I would love to see happen, but I’ll just have to make my own decision about what I think is right for me." On how she and the hubs 'totally binge-watched' House of Cards: It was "a little bit of the, 'Oh, my gosh, I can't believe we can just sit here and do this' and, 'We're only going to watch one episode, oh, let's watch another. OK, well, we have time, we're not going anywhere, let's watch a third.' I know that sounds kind of devoid of content." Speaking of Bill: "People say that he’s too thin. He doesn’t think so, and he has an enormous amount of energy." Oh, and her hair: "I’m at an age where I can pretty much do what I want: 'Here I am, whether you like my hair or not.'" Not a walker: The Wall Street Journal has an image of the cover, and it points out that, contrary to some online buzz, Clinton is not leaning on a walker. It's just a chair. Clinton kicks off a book tour next week for her memoir, Hard Choices. Cick to read about how she had reservations about a prisoner swap for Bowe Bergdahl.
Summary: Hillary Clinton considers another run for the presidency, expressing concerns about the state of the country and the glass ceiling for women in politics, while also revealing her and her husband's binge-watching habits and her own energy levels.
Story: – After a rough couple of days in the stocking of President Trump's administration, the Senate got back to business and pushed at least one more through. Oklahoma AG Scott Pruitt will head the Environmental Protection Agency, the Hill reports, after a Friday Senate vote confirmed him 52-46. As promised, Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins didn't cast a ballot for Pruitt, but every other GOP Senator did, with the exception of Arizona's John McCain, who was overseas at a conference. On the other side, West Virginia's Joe Manchin and North Dakota's Heidi Heitkamp declined to join their Dem colleagues in voting against him (Indiana's Joe Donnelly was the only Democrat who didn't vote). Democrats had lobbied to stall the vote for Pruitt—described by the New York Times as having "built a career out of suing to block the EPA's major environmental rules"—until after next Tuesday, when thousands of emails were ordered to be set loose by Pruitt's office regarding his correspondence with members of the oil and gas industries. But Jeff Holmstead, an EPA administrator in the George W. Bush administration, shrugs off the outcry over Pruitt. "Whoever was nominated by President Trump, the environmental community was going to demonize," he tells the Washington Post.
Summary: The Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with a vote of 52-46, despite opposition from Democrats who have criticized his track record of suing to block the agency's environmental rules.
Story: – The death toll from what Israel's critics are calling a massacre of unarmed protesters in Gaza hit 59 overnight with the death of a baby from tear gas inhalation, according to Palestinian authorities. The Palestinian Health Authority in Gaza says seven children under 18 were among the dozens of people killed when Israeli troops opened fire on protesters at the border fence Monday, the Washington Post reports. More than 2,700 others were wounded, the authority says, including 1,359 injured by live ammunition. Israel also dropped tear gas from drones in what was Gaza's deadliest day of violence since the 2014 war. The latest developments: South Africa, Turkey withdraw ambassadors. Israeli authorities say South Africa has recalled its ambassador to protest the shootings, the AP reports. Turkey is withdrawing its ambassadors from both the US and Israel. Kuwait drafted a United Nations Security Council resolution expressing outrage and calling for an independent investigation, but it was blocked by the US.
Summary: At least 59 Palestinians, including a baby and 7 children, were killed and over 2,700 injured when Israeli troops opened fire on protesters at the Gaza border fence, with South Africa and Turkey recalling their ambassadors and a UN Security Council resolution being blocked by the US.
Story: – Law enforcement agencies made more arrests for marijuana possession last year than for all violent crimes combined, despite decriminalization and outright legalization in some states, according to a new report from Human Rights Watch and the ACLU. The report is harshly critical of drug policies that have 137,000 Americans behind bars on any given day for possessing marijuana or other drugs for their own personal use. Many of them are in pretrial detention in local jails, and those who are convicted end up with criminal records that "lock them out of jobs, housing, education, welfare assistance, voting, and much more," the report states. The researchers found that black Americans smoke marijuana at around the same rate as whites but are four times as likely to be arrested for possessing small amounts of the drug, the New York Times reports. "It's been 45 years since the war on drugs was declared, and it hasn't been a success," lead author Tess Borden of Human Rights Watch tells the Washington Post. "Rates of drug use are not down. Drug dependency has not stopped. Every 25 seconds, we're arresting someone for drug use." The report calls for the government to take steps such as treating drug use as a health problem and decriminalizing the possession of drugs for personal use.
Summary: Law enforcement agencies made more arrests for marijuana possession in the US last year than for all violent crimes combined, despite decriminalization and legalization in some states, with black Americans being four times more likely to be arrested for possessing small amounts of the drug than whites.
Story: – The Birds' Head Haggadah—the oldest illustrated Passover manuscript in the world and one of its most intriguing—has been a prized possessions of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem for the past 70 years, the AP reports. Now the grandchildren of a Jewish lawyer killed by the Nazis say the 700-year-old Haggadah belongs to them. The grandchildren, led by 75-year-old Eli Barzilai, don't want Israel's most important museum to return the manuscript, but they do want compensation—less than $10 million, according to the Art Newspaper —and a plaque noting their family's ownership of the manuscript. The museum doesn't dispute the Haggadah was owned by Ludwig Marum for a time until 1933. It's what happened after that's a mystery. Marum was arrested by the Nazis and died in a concentration camp in 1934, the Jewish Press reports. A coworker who remembered the Haggadah, which features illustrations of humans with bird heads, from Marum's office saw it was in the museum's possession and decided to investigate. The museum told him it bought the manuscript from a Jewish immigrant for $600. The immigrant said he got it from a Jewish doctor, but the doctor denied it, and the trail went cold. Barzilai says that's because the manuscript was stolen from his family. The museum wants documentation from Barzilai showing what happened to the Haggadah between 1933 and 1946. The family has hired an American lawyer recently portrayed by Ryan Reynolds in the film Woman in Gold to represent them. (A painting looted by Nazis recently turned up in an Ohio home .)
Summary: The 700-year-old Birds Head Haggadah, the oldest illustrated Passover manuscript in the world, has been at the Israel Museum for 70 years, but the grandchildren of a Jewish lawyer killed by the Nazis claim it belongs to them and are seeking compensation of less than $10 million and a plaque acknowledging their ownership.
Story: – Protesters gathered outside a Baton Rouge, La., convenience store Tuesday night to express their outrage over yet another controversial police shooting. Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old man who sold CDs outside the Triple S Food Mart, was shot dead after what cops describe as "some sort of altercation" at 12:35am Tuesday with two officers responding to an anonymous call about an armed man, the Advocate reports. In graphic bystander video circulating online, the officers can be seen pinning Sterling to the ground before apparently shooting him multiple times. The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner says Sterling, who is black, died from multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and back. Triple S Food Mart owner Abdullah Muflahi tells the New York Daily News that Sterling bought a gun for protection a few days ago after hearing that other CD sellers had been robbed, but it wasn't in his hand during the confrontation with police, nor was his hand in his pocket. Sterling, who was Tasered during the incident, "was screaming, 'What did I do? What's going on?'" Muflahi says. Muflahi tells the Advocate that after the shooting, the officer who fired the shots cursed and both men appeared to be "freaking out." Both officers are now on administrative leave, and US Rep. Cedric Richmond has called for a federal investigation, saying the video footage is "deeply troubling and has understandably evoked strong emotion and anger in our community," NBC News reports.
Summary: Protesters gathered outside a Baton Rouge convenience store after a black man, Alton Sterling, was shot and killed by police officers responding to an anonymous call about an armed man, with bystander video showing the officers pinning Sterling to the ground and shooting him multiple times, leading to calls for a federal investigation.
Story: – President Obama learned some hard lessons during last year's debt ceiling talks, and he's heading into the new round to avoid the fiscal cliff determined to take his case to the people. Rather than "hunkering down" with congressional leaders behind closed doors for weeks—a strategy that damaged him in 2011—aides tell the New York Times that Obama will travel outside of DC in an effort to ramp up public support for his plan, which combines spending cuts with higher taxes on the rich, with the ultimate goal of breaking through DC's partisan gridlock. (John Boehner seems like he might be agreeable to that.) Talks are scheduled to begin Friday, but Obama will meet with corporate executives on Wednesday in an effort to regain support in the business world, and will take his case to the public sometime after Thanksgiving. Many business leaders are looking for a budget compromise similar to what Obama favors, and the president thinks he can use them to convince congressional Republicans to see things his way. Both the Times and Bloomberg note that on yesterday's talk shows, Republican lawmakers voiced a newfound openness to working with Obama, even including the possibility of raising taxes without actually increasing tax rates for the wealthy. Indeed, Bloomberg reports, leaders from both parties see an end to the standoff on the horizon. (For more, Politico has five possible fiscal cliff scenarios.)
Summary: President Obama is taking his budget plan to the people and business leaders in an effort to gain support and break through partisan gridlock, with a focus on combining spending cuts with higher taxes on the wealthy and meeting with corporate executives before talks with Congress begin on Friday.
Story: – The Veterans Day military parade President Trump ordered in February has been controversial from the start, with critics wondering if Trump was trolling the nation, the Pentagon saying the tanks Trump wanted couldn't be involved, and the Office of Management and Budget warning the whole thing could cost millions. And now it turns out it may actually cost even more millions than originally thought: Officials who spoke anonymously to the AP, ABC News, and CNBC say the latest preliminary estimate is $92 million, up from an original estimate of $10 million to $30 million. The officials say about $50 million of that is Pentagon costs including aircraft, equipment, personnel, and other support and the rest is largely related to security costs. But the estimates have not yet been finalized or released publicly, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has yet to approve parade plans; at least one official warns that, depending on the scope of the plans Mattis signs off on, the cost estimate could change. The defense bill Trump signed this week authorized the November parade.
Summary: The estimated cost of President Trump's Veterans Day military parade has increased to $92 million, up from an initial estimate of $10 million to $30 million, with $50 million of the total being Pentagon costs and the rest related to security expenses, although the final cost estimate has not yet been released and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has not yet approved the parade plans.
Story: – Dyne Suh and her friends were minutes away from the cabin they'd booked on Airbnb for a weekend getaway in Big Bear, Calif., when the host abruptly canceled the reservation, leaving the group stranded in a snowstorm—and told Suh she was doing so because Suh is Asian. Suh originally made the reservation for two people, but later confirmed with the host that she could add two people and two dogs to the reservation. Upon texting the host again as they approached the cabin to ask how to pay for the additional guests, Suh got this in reply (errors have been left intact): "If you think 4 people and 2 dogs ate getting a room fir $50 a night on big bear mountain during the busiest weekend of the year ..… You are insanely high." Suh argued that they had already confirmed the additional people on the reservation; the host called Suh a "con artist" and said, "I wouldn't rent it to u if u were the last person on earth." She added: "One word says it all. Asian." When Suh responded that she would report the host to Airbnb for racism, the host replied, "Go ahead ... It's why we have trump." The incident happened over President's Day weekend, on Feb. 17, but is just now getting mainstream attention after being reported by NBC Los Angeles and KTLA, the Washington Post reports. Suh, a law student, happened to park next to a KTLA reporter moments after the text exchange; he interviewed her then, though it's not clear why the interview didn't air until recently. As Suh told concerned friends on Facebook after the incident, the group was able to find alternate lodging after driving around in the storm for hours; Airbnb refunded their original reservation cost and offered to pay for the new lodging. The site also says the host, who was contacted by NBC and KTLA but had no comment, has been permanently banned. (Nivea recently had to apologize for an ad many saw as racist.)
Summary: A group of friends, including Dyne Suh, were stranded in a snowstorm in Big Bear, California after the host of their Airbnb cabin abruptly canceled the reservation due to Suh's race, using racist language and slurs, and was permanently banned from the platform.
Story: – That was fast: The deal Ted Cruz and John Kasich forged on Sunday to stop Donald Trump winning already looks shaky, with confusion over whether Kasich's supporters should vote for him or not next week. Trump, meanwhile, is poised to win all five Eastern states—Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Connecticut—voting in Tuesday's primaries. A roundup of coverage: Kasich appeared to undermine the deal on Monday when he told reporters that Indiana supporters should still vote for him, reports the Washington Post. "I've never told 'em not to vote for me," Kasich said. "They ought to vote for me. But I'm not over there campaigning and spending resources." Hours earlier, Kasich's Indiana campaign co-chair had said his supporters should vote for Cruz to keep Trump from winning the state on May 3. Republican insiders are very skeptical about whether the deal will actually work, the Hill reports. Some believe Kasich supporters are unlikely to embrace Cruz. The Ohio governor's supporters are now "left choosing between two people who they see as unappealing," GOP operative Mike Murphy says. On the campaign trail Monday, Trump slammed the "collusion" as evidence of how "weak" and "pathetic" his rivals are, reports the Guardian. "If you collude in business, or if you collude in the stock market, they put you in jail," he said. "But in politics, because it's a rigged system, because it's a corrupt enterprise, in politics you're allowed to collude." RedState explains the delegate allocation process in the five states voting Tuesday and predicts a near-total sweep for Trump, though a weak spot could be Pennsylvania, which is the only state where polls put Cruz instead of Kasich second. FiveThirtyEight also predicts Trump wins in all five states, though its state-by-state analysis finds a few spots where Kasich could sneak wins. It will be interesting to see which version of Trump takes the stage for a victory speech, the New York Times notes. If it's the Trump who slams Cruz as "Lyin' Ted" instead of the more statesmanlike Trump seen after his New York victory, it could signal that a "messy spectacle at the convention" lies ahead, whether he gets 1,237 delegates or not. (Trump's latest target is Kasich's "disgusting" eating habits.)
Summary: Ted Cruz and John Kasich's deal to stop Donald Trump from winning may be shaky as Kasich's supporters are unsure if they should vote for Cruz, while Trump is poised to win all five Eastern states in Tuesday's primaries.
Story: – Anyone who’s waited by the mailbox for an important letter or much-needed paycheck will want to be first in line for a new free service USPS is rolling out widely in mid-April. Residential customers who sign up for Informed Delivery will receive a daily email with high-quality photo scans of their incoming envelope fronts, reports NBC News. The emails display up to 10 images—if there are more than 10 on a given day, the rest can be viewed via a link that stays active for seven days. After receiving “tremendously positive” feedback in pilot test runs, executive program director Bob Dixon says the program has been particularly appealing to people living with roommates, since they’re not always first to retrieve their daily mail. Frequent travelers are another group utilizing the service, which Dixon personally attests to as one of Informed Delivery’s first users. He tells NPR that he was able to flag a jury duty summons while on the road and asked his son to set it aside so it didn’t get lost in a towering mail pile. With the rate of mail delivery declining (61.2 billion pieces of first-class mail were handled by USPS in 2016 compared to 98 billion in 2006), the service is one way the post office is innovating and trying to remain relevant. "Our emerging consumers, younger folks, are digital natives," Dixon says. "That's how their communications are coming to them." USPS has opened sign-up for Informed Delivery at: informeddelivery.USPS.com. (Finland's postal service tried to innovate in a different way.)
Summary: USPS is launching Informed Delivery, a free service that sends daily email images of incoming mail to residential customers, allowing them to track and manage their mail, particularly appealing to roommates and frequent travelers.
Story: – One of the Apple announcements getting a lot of attention is the company's $99 stylus—called the Apple Pencil—for the iPad Pro. As Apple watchers were quick to point out, Steve Jobs himself hated the idea. "Who wants a stylus?" he asked in 2007. "You have to get em', put em' away. You lose them. Yuck." And in 2010, he said, "If you see a stylus, they blew it." ABC rounds up some of the immediate, snarky reactions, like this. A Gizmodo blogger sees the development as a sign that Tim Cook and his team "feel confident enough in their own leadership to ignore the now very infamous words of Jobs." More importantly, it looks like a good product, one that's a "necessity if Apple wants to compete for the business of design and engineering professionals who need a stylus to do their jobs on a tablet." And at the Verge, a blogger notes that it's a much different world now than when Jobs first condemned the stylus. "What's missing from the reactions is the obvious acknowledgment that Jobs was not only talking about using a stylus with an entirely different product—the 3.5-inch iPhone 1—but he was referring to both styluses and screens that have been blown out of the water by newer technology." For one thing, the iPad Pro has a nearly 13-inch screen. Competitors such as Microsoft and Samsung already have similar technology on the market, and Cook is showing that he's OK playing catch-up when he thinks the time is right. Still, it's a notable shift. As Fast Company declares in its headline about the Apple Pencil, "The Steve Jobs Era Is Over." (More on Apple's new toys here.)
Summary: Apple has released a $99 stylus, the Apple Pencil, for the iPad Pro, despite Steve Jobs' previous opposition to the idea, with some observers seeing it as a sign of confidence in Tim Cook's leadership and a recognition of the changing technology landscape.
Story: – Cartoonlike images of faces and serpents that appear to be the work of one person are popping up at national parks across the West, and the feds want to know who's behind them. Fortunately for them, the "artist" also signed the graffiti with her Instagram handle, creepytings, and though the account has since been deleted, it appears linked to a Tumblr page showing graffiti at various national parks, including Crater Lake, Death Valley, Zion, and Joshua Tree, reports TakePart. (The Tumblr page has since been wiped clean, save for one choice confessional statement: "i dun f***ed uuuuuuup.") A screenshot of a now-deleted Instagram comment thread reveals a viewer asking if the graffiti is paint or chalk, to which creepytings replied, "acrylic." When the commenter responded with a frowning emotion, creepytings replied, "I know, I'm a bad person." Now an investigator at Yosemite National Park has taken to Reddit to gather more evidence, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. And while the National Park Service wouldn't comment on the open investigation, a spokesman did say, "Vandalism is not only a violation of the law, but it also damages and sometimes destroys often irreplaceable treasures that belong to all Americans. It is not only criminal, it is thoughtless." (Earlier this year a graffiti suspect upped his charges to a felony when he defaced his courtroom.)
Summary: An anonymous artist has been leaving cartoon-like images of faces and serpents in various national parks across the West, signing their work with their Instagram handle "creepytings," leading to an investigation by the National Park Service.
Story: – A gunman using an automatic weapon opened fire near the US embassy in Sarajevo before he was arrested, police say. The suspected radical Islamist shooter was wounded and treated before being hospitalized, a police official told local TV. Two police officers were wounded in the operation, “one in the leg and one in the head,” national radio said. No embassy workers were hurt. The man, whom TV reports identified as Mevlid Jasarevic, was reported to be a member of the conservative Wahhabi branch of Islam, AFP notes. One of Bosnia’s three presidents, Bakir Izetbegovic, condemned “the terrorist attack,” the AP reports. “The United States is a proven friend of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its government and its people supported us in the most difficult moments in our history and nobody has the right to jeopardize our relations.”
Summary: A gunman opened fire near the US embassy in Sarajevo, wounding two police officers and a suspected radical Islamist, who was later hospitalized, before being identified as a member of the conservative Wahhabi branch of Islam.
Story: – Despite insisting last month that they're just friends, Scarlett Johansson and Sean Penn continue to set tongues wagging that there may be just a little bit more going on. Tuesday morning, they took a private jet to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where they were seen having lobster and margaritas, People reports. They were back in California by early yesterday. Penn, 50, and Johansson, 26, were also spotted earlier this week having a very friendly-looking lunch—ScarJo had her leg in Penn's lap. Click to see another Hollywood A-lister recently linked to Johansson.
Summary: Scarlett Johansson and Sean Penn were spotted on a private jet to Cabo San Lucas and had a friendly lunch together, fueling rumors of a possible romantic relationship despite their previous denials of being just friends.
Story: – Brad Pitt is opening up about the "nutter" who attacked him last week at the Hollywood premiere of Maleficent as he was signing autographs. "I saw someone stage-diving over the barrier at me. I took a step back; this guy had latched onto my lapels," he tells People, referring to prankster Vitalii Sediuk. "I looked down and the nutter was trying to bury his face in my crotch, so I cracked him twice in the back of the head—not too hard—but enough to get his attention." "I think he was then just grabbing for a hand hold because the guys were on him, and he reached up and caught my glasses," Pitt continues. "I don't mind an exhibitionist, but if this guy keeps it up he's going to spoil it for the fans who have waited up all night for an autograph or a selfie, because it will make people more wary to approach a crowd." (Sediuk has engaged in numerous other similar pranks.) As for Angelina Jolie, she tells the AP she and Pitt won't tighten their security: "People like that are an exception to the rule. Most fans are just wonderful."
Summary: Brad Pitt recounts an incident where a prankster, Vitalii Sediuk, attacked him at a Hollywood premiere by trying to bury his face in Pitt's crotch before reaching for his glasses, causing Pitt to hit him twice on the back of the head.
Story: – Want human beings to feel a massive ego-boost? Then look elsewhere, because a ground-breaking study published by Science finds that insects ruled the Earth about 400 million years ago and grew wings long before any other animal, reports Heritage Daily. They cropped up as plants began diversifying, in fact, and in short order created most of the major insect groups still flying today, notes Wired. So which one came first? Insects resembling today's silverfish existed roughly 480 million years ago, an expert tells Tech Times: "Then, about 400 million years ago, ancient ancestors of today's dragonflies and mayflies were the first to develop wings," he says. More on the study: Lice came relatively recently, cropping up about 53 million years ago (when modern mammals and birds came around). So primates are actually older than those little guys. By the evolutionary clock, insects diversified quickly. Consider that plants colonized Earth over the past 450 million years; well, insects needed just 80 million years to take over the skies and form most of their major groups. Led by a group in China, the study solicited genetic data from more than 100 insect specialists around the world and crunched it all with a supercomputer. This leapfrogged the fairly slow pace at which experts were analyzing insect subsets on their own. The study created the first-ever thorough evolutionary tree for insects, notes LiveScience. For more on insects, read about parasites that suck on mosquitoes' blood.
Summary: According to a groundbreaking study published in Science, insects evolved wings before any other animal and dominated the Earth about 400 million years ago, with some insect groups diversifying quickly and forming major groups within 80 million years.
Story: – Campaigners want a vast area of floating garbage in the ocean to be the world's newest country—and they've already got more would-be citizens than some real countries. Al Gore is on board as the first honorary citizen of the "Trash Isles," which is what activists are calling the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a huge part of the Pacific Ocean inundated with floating plastic trash, Reuters reports. "We want to shrink this nation. We don't want any more plastic added," Gore says. "The oceans are crucial to our survival and we need to protect them." More than 100,000 other people have signed a petition to become "citizens" and pressure the United Nations to accept the Trash Isles as the world's 196th country. The petition, which says garbage clogs an area the size of France, states that nationhood would cause the Trash Isles to be covered by the UN's Environmental Charter, meaning other nations would be obliged to help clean it up, Quartz reports. The lead campaigners, two advertising professionals who have partnered with publisher LADBible and the Plastic Oceans Foundation nonprofit, have created a flag, passports, and even a Trash Isles currency, reports AdWeek. The currency, called "Debris," features seabirds, turtles, and other animals affected by what campaigners call an ongoing "environmental catastrophe." (Researchers say there are at least 5 trillion pieces of plastic in the world's oceans.)
Summary: Activists are seeking to create the "Trash Isles" as the world's newest country, made up of a vast area of floating garbage in the Pacific Ocean, with former US Vice President Al Gore as the first honorary citizen.
Story: – A broken door handle proved deadly for two women in the Czech Republic on Saturday. Police say a mother and daughter, ages 65 and 45, died after becoming trapped in their friend's sauna for roughly 90 minutes. A police rep who spoke about the freak accident—which the AFP reports happened near Jicin, to the northeast of Prague—says it appears the women were unable to exit the sauna after the handle broke, and their attempts to break the door's window were unsuccessful. Their friend found them on the floor after noting the time and deciding to check on them. While sauna deaths are rare, they do occur: A 2008 study published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences looked at sauna-related fatalities between 1990 and 2002 in Finland and found an annual death rate of less than two per 100,000 inhabitants. The study found heat exposure was behind a quarter of the deaths. Saunas and Finland were under the microscope once again in 2010, when a finalist at the World Sauna Championships there collapsed and died after spending six minutes in a 230-degree Fahrenheit sauna. While such temperatures might seem uncommon outside of Finland, an organizer told the BBC at the time that "It is not so unusual" here. The competition was permanently ended due to Russian Vladimir Ladyzhensky's death. The temperature of the sauna the women were using in the Czech Republic hasn't been reported. (But there are some benefits to using saunas, too.)
Summary: Two women in the Czech Republic died after becoming trapped in a sauna for 90 minutes due to a broken door handle, with the cause of death attributed to heat exposure.
Story: – Rand Paul has only been on the job for a few months, but he wants everyone to know, for the record, that he's definitely running for reelection in five years ... assuming he doesn't become president or anything first. The Kentucky senator made the unusual move of filing a statement of candidacy to run for re-election just 11 weeks after taking office, the AP reports. But despite the early file, Paul has suggested he might have his eye on a presidential run, and Politico notes that no sooner had he filed this reelection paperwork than he jetted off to South Carolina, an early primary state.
Summary: Rand Paul has filed a statement of candidacy for re-election to the Senate in 2024, despite speculation about a potential presidential run.
Story: – No NFL player who has used the national anthem to protest against racism and police brutality has faced punishment from the league. That could be about to change. The Wall Street Journal reports NFL owners are scheduled to meet next week, and league spokesperson Joe Lockhart expects player protests "to be front and center on the agenda." Owners are reportedly considering changing the section of the NFL manual that states players "should" stand for the national anthem in order to make it a requirement. "We believe that everyone should stand for the national anthem," ESPN quotes NFL commissioner Roger Goodell as saying in a letter to teams Tuesday. "It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us." Owners are said to be privately concerned about an ongoing fight with the president affecting their bottom lines. Weeks into his attack on kneeling players, President Trump shows no sign of stopping. "Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country? Change tax law!" the president tweeted Tuesday. (The NFL gave up its tax exempt status in 2015.) And Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during a White House press conference Tuesday the administration is "glad to see the NFL taking positive steps" toward ending protests during the anthem, the Washington Post reports. While a source says "there is no fixed proposal" yet for requiring players to stand for the anthem, Lockhart says the owners believe they can make the change without the consent of the players union.
Summary: NFL owners are considering changing the league's manual to require players to stand for the national anthem, despite no punishment being handed down to players who have protested racism and police brutality during the anthem.
Story: – A FedEx employee in the Bay Area is accused of burglarizing homes while he was supposed to be working, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Police say 57-year-old Kevin Baker ripped off three homes near Palo Alto between May 3 and May 17. Baker is a convicted felon with a bunch of theft-related infractions to his name. He's been charged with first-degree burglary, and a FedEx spokesperson says the company is cooperating with authorities. According to the Mercury News, FedEx security personnel helped police in the apprehension of Baker. (A Royal Canadian Mint worker was accused of smuggling gold coins and nuggets from his job site in his rectum.)
Summary: A FedEx employee in the Bay Area, Kevin Baker, has been accused of burglarizing three homes while on the job, with a criminal history of theft-related infractions and charged with first-degree burglary, and FedEx is cooperating with authorities.
Story: – A draft constitution was approved in Egypt this morning after a marathon 16-hour voting session, but liberal, secular, and Christian members of the assembly have been walking out in protest for weeks, leaving Islamists to approve the draft without their input. The move, which was rushed in order to get the draft approved before the court rules on Sunday whether to dissolve the assembly, will likely further inflame tension between President Mohamed Morsi's supporters and the opponents who are angry over his recent power grab. An opposition rally is planned for today, the AP reports. Opponents say the new constitution, which the Wall Street Journal reports will be put to a national referendum mid-December, could give too much power to Muslim clerics and frequently refers to strict Shariah law, thus restricting freedoms. Women's rights are a particular concern; though the draft declares all citizens equal, one article specifically protecting women's equality was dumped. The revolutionaries did get some of their demands, the New York Times reports, including restrictions on torture and indefinite detention; but the new draft also gives much of the military's power back. Morsi says his new, controversial powers "will end as soon as the people vote on a constitution," Reuters reports.
Summary: In Egypt, a controversial draft constitution was approved by Islamists after liberal, secular, and Christian members of the assembly walked out in protest, despite opposition from opponents who fear it will give too much power to Muslim clerics and restrict freedoms, including women's rights.
Story: – Even in a career as glittering as Beyonce's, Sunday's MTV Music Video Awards will count as a massive highlight. She utterly dominated the night, winning eight awards, including Best Video for "Formation," and left the crowd in awe with what the AP calls an "epic 16-minute concert" that featured five songs from Lemonade. Four things to know from the night: Before the show, Beyonce posed with guests Lezley McSpadden, Gwen Carr, Wanda Johnson, and Sybrina Fulton, who are the mothers of Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, and Eric Garner, Rolling Stone reports. Beyonce has said she is inspired by the women, whose sons' deaths at the hands of police—or, in Trayvon's case, George Zimmerman—inspired protests. Britney Spears had what Vox calls the "impossible task of following Beyonce" and while her lip-synced performance of new single "Make Me" is getting mixed reviews, critics agree it was a world away from her disastrous 2007 performance, which was her last time on the VMA stage. Rihanna performed several hits over the course of the show and was presented with the Video Vanguard Award by former boyfriend Drake. "She's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old," said Drake, who didn't collect his Best Hip Hop Video award earlier in the night, CNN reports. Presenter Sean Combs said he was "stuck in traffic." Kanye West took the stage for four minutes in what the Los Angeles Times describes as a "freewheeling, remarkably self-indulgent stream-of-conscious rant" that served as a heartfelt tribute to himself. Among other things, he discussed his explicit video for "Famous," Taylor Swift controversies old and new, and Chicago gun violence.
Summary: Beyoncé dominated the MTV Video Music Awards, winning eight awards including Best Video for "Formation" and delivering an epic 16-minute concert, while other notable performances included Rihanna's hits and Kanye West's self-indulgent tribute to himself.
Story: – A 28-year-old Florida woman says her life has been destroyed by horrible allergies. But it's not pollen, cats, or peanuts she's allergic to; it's her own sweat and tears. "You don't realize how much your body sweats until you become allergic to it," Julie Reid writes on her blog. "I would say it's one step shy of being allergic to breathing or blinking." Reid, a gymnastics and dance instructor, was diagnosed with a rare condition called cholinergic urticaria three years ago, ABC News reports. People with the condition, which comes on for seemingly no reason, have overly sensitive skin that reacts to sweat, tears, and even hot showers. According to WFTS, the painfully itchy hives Reid breaks out in can last for days on end; her blog features graphic pictures. Since developing cholinergic urticaria, Reid has lost her job and gained more than 100 pounds. She says she can't go the store without getting horrible looks due to her hives. "I used to be so beautiful; now I look like a monster," she tells WFTS. "I just stay in bed and cry and cry." Reid says the Florida heat makes going out during the day impossible anyway. She says she's depressed and barely bothers to get out of bed anymore. "It's torture living like this," she says. The condition is known to disappear as spontaneously as it comes, though there is no timeline. Doctors can provide antihistamines, but without a job or health insurance, Reid has a hard time paying for appointments. She's hoping her plight will bring more attention—and hopefully a cure—to cholinergic urticaria. (Some people are allergic to vibrations, and scientists now think they know why.)
Summary: A 28-year-old woman in Florida has been diagnosed with a rare condition called cholinergic urticaria, which causes her to be allergic to her own sweat and tears, leading to painful hives and itching that can last for days, causing her to lose her job and gain weight, and making it difficult for her to go out in public due to the Florida heat and resulting depression.
Story: – Authorities say an Amtrak train struck a piece of construction equipment just south of Philadelphia, and two people were killed, reports Reuters, citing local media. Some injuries are being reported. Service on the Northeast Corridor between New York and Philadelphia has been suspended, reports the AP. Amtrak said Train 89 was heading from New York to Savannah, Georgia, when it struck a backhoe that was on the track in Chester, about 15 miles outside of Philadelphia. The impact derailed the lead engine of the train. About 341 passengers and seven crew members were on board. Amtrak said initial reports are that some passengers were being treated for injuries. Local emergency responders are on the scene and the crash is being investigated.
Summary: An Amtrak train struck a backhoe on the tracks in Chester, Pennsylvania, killing two people and injuring others, with service on the Northeast Corridor between New York and Philadelphia suspended as authorities investigate the crash.
Story: – Two college students have been charged with what police are calling the gang rape of a woman on a public beach in broad daylight, and Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen tells the Panama City News Herald that hundreds of nearby spring break revelers did absolutely nothing to stop the "most disgusting, sickening thing" he'd ever seen. Delonte' Martistee, 22, and Ryan Austin Calhoun, 23, were charged Friday with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators. WFSA reports both are students at Alabama's Troy University and have been suspended by the school; Martistee has additionally been booted from its track team. The attack allegedly occurred between March 10 and 12 in the beachside city in the Florida Panhandle; it came to light when Alabama police investigating a shooting found cell phone footage of the attack and passed it to their counterparts in Florida, reports CBS News. "This is happening in broad daylight with hundreds of people seeing and hearing what is happening, and they are more concerned about spilling their beer than somebody being raped," said McKeithen per the AP. He compared the video—in which men can be seen assaulting an incapacitated woman on a beach chair as exclamations to the effect of "she'll never know" are heard—to "wild animals preying on a carcass laying in the woods." The victim "knows something happened, but she doesn't know what happened," he adds. WJHG reports the woman is 19; she told police she thinks she was drugged at the time. Police say at least three men raped her, and CBS reports police are looking for two additional suspects. Martistee remained in jail as of Sunday while Calhoun was released on bond; their next court date is May 19.
Summary: Two college students, Delonte Martistee and Ryan Austin Calhoun, were charged with gang raping a 19-year-old woman on a public beach in broad daylight, with hundreds of nearby spring break revelers failing to intervene despite hearing the victim's cries for help.
Story: – Texas could suffer "irreparable injury" if three generations of a family that fled the Syrian civil war are allowed to fly to Dallas from Jordan on Friday, according to the state's lawyers. Texas has filed a lawsuit to prevent the refugees—a man named Tamman, his wife, their two young children, and his parents—from being resettled in the state, reports the Houston Chronicle. The lawsuit, which names the federal government as well as the International Rescue Committee nonprofit, says state officials have not been consulted about the resettlement or given enough information on background checks, the Texas Tribune reports. Texas is one of around 30 states trying to block Syrian refugees, which President Obama says they don't have the legal authority to do. Texas first threatened the lawsuit days ago, arguing that under federal law, the resettlement group is required to cooperate with the state. Aid worker Anne Marie Weiss-Armush tells the Chronicle that two Dallas-area apartments have already been obtained for the family, who have a relative that was resettled in Texas earlier this year and now works at Walmart. "It's kind of nerve-wrecking because it really is a test case," she says. "It's like, is Gov. Abbott going to meet them at the airport and send them away?" The AP reports that Texas has taken in 243 Syrians over the last five years, and the IRC plans to bring in another family of four next week. "Refugees are victims of terror, not terrorists, and the families we help have always been welcomed by the people of Texas," the group said in a statement. "The IRC acts within the spirit and letter of the law, and we are hopeful that this matter is resolved soon."
Summary: Texas is suing to prevent a family of four Syrian refugees, including a man, his wife, and their two young children, from being resettled in the state, citing concerns about background checks and lack of consultation with state officials.
Story: – All the buzz Tuesday morning about Melania Trump plagiarizing a speech by Michelle Obama is "just really absurd." At least that's the stance the Trump campaign is taking after a controversial night at the RNC. She wouldn't "do something like that knowing how scrutinized her speech was going to be," Trump spokesman Paul Manafort tells CNN. "There's no cribbing of Michelle Obama's speech. These were common words and values." He then pivoted to attack Donald Trump's presumed Democratic rival, per Politico: "This is once again an example of when a woman threatens Hillary Clinton, how she seeks out to demean her and take her down." (See the speech similarities here.)
Summary: The Trump campaign dismisses concerns about Melania Trump's speech at the RNC, arguing that she would not intentionally plagiarize Michelle Obama's speech and that the similarities are due to common values and words.
Story: – Eight people are dead after "execution-style" shootings in rural southern Ohio on Friday, reports WBNS. According to WCPO, the victims in the rampage in Peebles are all members of the Rhoden family. One of the dead is a 16-year-old boy, the AP reports. Multiple homes were involved in what the Ohio attorney general describes as a "grisly scene." A number of the dead were found in bed, including a mother who had been sleeping with her 4-day-old baby. The baby survived. The shootings took place at four homes—three within a few miles of each other and the fourth within 30 miles. No arrests have been made, and police are unclear even how many shooters there were. None people found dead appear to have killed themselves, which means the shooter or shooters may still be on the loose. If that's the case, authorities say they are "extremely dangerous." Police say the shootings do not appear random, but no motive has been determined, ABC 6 reports.
Summary: In rural southern Ohio, eight people, including a 16-year-old boy, were killed in "execution-style" shootings across four homes, with no arrests made and the possibility of multiple shooters still at large, according to reports.
Story: – A man prepared to defend in court his claim of ownership of a tiny island off the coast of North Carolina remains undeterred despite said island having, by all appearances, ceased to exist, the Charlotte Observer reports. "My land will always be there," says Ken Barlow of Virginia, adding, "I will NEVER relinquish what I own to the National Park Service. I will defend that property with the necessary force to repel invaders." According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Shelly Island—so named for the thousands of shells found by tourists who visited it—formed off Cape Hatteras National Seashore in spring 2017 and grew to a mile long and 450 feet wide. Barlow paid $26 and filed a Quit Claim Deed for Shelly Island in August, mostly to keep it out of the hands of the "incompetent" National Park Service, which he's mad at for restricting seashore access to protect wildlife. Barlow's claim was immediately contested. North Carolina law states ownership of any island in navigable waters "shall vest in the state." Barlow says he disagrees with that law. "I own it. It is clear. The story is over," Barlow told WAVY in September. It may be a moot point. Later that month, multiple hurricanes battered Shelly Island, sinking it below the water. The disappearance of Shelly Island was confirmed by NASA satellite photos and announced by Barlow's hated National Park Service on Tuesday. Barlow says at least part of his Shelly Island merged with nearby Cape Point. But even if that's true, WNCN reports Cape Point is under federal control, and officials say that means whatever is left of Shelly Island is owned by, you guessed it, the National Park Service. (A tech CEO has claimed uninhabited land between Egypt and Sudan for himself.)
Summary: A man named Ken Barlow is determined to defend his claim of ownership of a tiny island off the coast of North Carolina, despite the island having disappeared due to hurricanes, as he believes he owns the land and will not relinquish it to the National Park Service.
Story: – Serena Williams did away with the traditional skirt and donned a striking, full-length bodysuit during the French Open. And she did so for health, as well as fashion, reasons. Just don't expect to see it again. “I believe we have sometimes gone too far," French Tennis Federation chief Bernard Giudicelli tells Tennis Magazine, per the Independent. "Serena’s outfit this year, for example, would no longer be accepted. You have to respect the game and the place.” But as Williams explained during the May tournament, the bodysuit—she called it a "Wakanda-inspired catsuit"—wasn't just about looks, as Slate reported. She'd just been through a difficult, dangerous pregnancy, and the suit's compression pants improved circulation and helped ward off clots. "For all the moms out there who had a tough recovery from pregnancy—here you go,” she wrote online. “If I can do it, so can you.” Williams will be competing in the US Open, which starts Monday, but there's no word yet about her court attire. (Before a recent big loss, Williams learned jarring news about her half-sister's killer.)
Summary: Serena Williams wore a full-length bodysuit during the French Open for both fashion and health reasons, including improved circulation and clot prevention after a difficult pregnancy, but it's unlikely she'll repeat the look at future tournaments.
Story: – Michele Bachmann became the first GOP presidential hopeful to sign an extremely socially conservative pledge that might sorta call for a ban on porn. The pledge, which is being put forth by an Iowa-based group called The Family Leader, is ostensibly primarily about marriage; it’s called “The Marriage Vow—a Declaration of Dependence upon Marriage and Family.” But some, like ThinkProgress, have been criticizing it for also including a clause condemning porn. The clause in question is confusing, Mediaite observes. It insists candidates support the “humane protection of women and the innocent fruit of conjugal intimacy”—meaning children—“from human trafficking, sexual slavery, seduction into promiscuity, and all forms of pornography.” That’s not actually calling for a “porn ban,” as some are reporting, but does lump porn together with sex slavery. Other eyebrow-raising things the pledge calls for include: "Rejection of Sharia Islam” (Though a later clause calls for a “fierce defense” of “religious liberty”) “Recognition that robust childbearing and reproduction is beneficial” to the US Support for a “cooling-off” period for anyone wanting a divorce “Vigorous opposition” to any recognition of “unions which are bigamous, polygamous, polyandrous, same-sex, etc.”
Summary: Michele Bachmann became the first GOP presidential candidate to sign a socially conservative pledge that includes a clause condemning pornography, which some have interpreted as a call for a ban, but the pledge actually lumps porn together with sex slavery.
Story: – Samantha Bee had a request for Ivanka Trump Wednesday on her show, and the way she worded that request is not going over well with conservatives. The Full Frontal host flashed a photo Ivanka tweeted Sunday showing the First Daughter holding her young son, calling it "oblivious" due to the outcry this week over immigrant parents and children reportedly being separated at the US border. "You know, Ivanka, that's a beautiful photo of you and your child, but let me just say, one mother to another: Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless c---," Bee said. "He listens to you. Put on something tight and low-cut and tell your father to f---ing stop it. Tell him it was an Obama thing and see how it goes, OK?" Outrage soon followed from the right, USA Today reports, followed by a quick apology from Bee. Read on for more:
Summary: Samantha Bee called out Ivanka Trump on her show, using a photo of the First Daughter with her child to criticize her father's immigration policies and urging her to use her influence to stop the separation of migrant parents and children at the US border.
Story: – A 68-year-old London retiree has just taken on tech giant Apple, representing himself in court, and won. The uncommon victory for Deric White is the culmination of a one-year battle in court after White dropped off his phone for servicing at the Apple Store on Regent Street in London, only to return 20 minutes later to find that employees had wiped his entire phone clean without asking permission first, reports the Evening Standard. When his wife learned that their 2014 honeymoon photos from the Seychelles were gone, she cried, and White, who'd just beaten cancer, decided to wage another battle. "Having fought cancer," he says, "I was not going to get defeated by Apple." "I did this for the common man," White says. "It's not so much the money that I have won, but it's the moral victory. ... It's a monumental victory." White asked for just over $7,000 so that he and his wife could take their trip a second time, but he was reportedly happy with the roughly $3,000 he was awarded instead. He says he and his wife plan to spend it on a trip to Cornwall in the UK. In addition to losing his honeymoon pics and "favorite" video of a tortoise biting his hand, he lost pictures from an African safari, as well as photos of the medical team from his 10-month battle against cancer of the esophagus. White's case is a good reminder to regularly back up devices, notes the Daily Dot, since even tech support is far from infallible, and "you never know when you could drop it in the toilet and lose everything." (Apple lost what could be a far bigger battle earlier this year.)
Summary: A 68-year-old London retiree, Deric White, won a legal battle against tech giant Apple after employees wiped his entire phone clean without permission, resulting in the loss of his honeymoon photos and other important memories.
Story: – Audiences seem to like Suicide Squad, but critics most certainly do not. One of the most hyped films of the year has just a 27% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, compared to a 74% rating from viewers. Here's what critics are saying: Consider this "the latest letdown for DC Comics fans who've been waiting for someone to pick up the baton Christopher Nolan left behind and do this universe justice," Rene Rodriguez writes at the Miami Herald. There's not a "moment of spontaneous fun or humor," and the script is "a giant pile of nonsense." Rodriguez is no fan of Jared Leto's "cartoonish" Joker, while Will Smith is simply "coasting" as assassin Deadshot. The flick actually "gives villainy a bad name," writes Adam Graham at the Detroit News. Among the disappointments: "A consistent tone is never established, the action is choppy, and the climax reaches Green Lantern levels of embarrassment," he writes. But the biggest sin is "that in a movie about villains they couldn't get an interesting villain for the Squad to fight against." Andrew O'Hehir at Salon offers a silver lining: "Sure, it's terrible. But it's not even close to the worst movie of the summer or the year" and "the terrible reviews will have little impact on its opening weekend," he writes. That said, "the only thing remotely surprising about this movie is how profoundly second-rate it turned out to be at every level of conception and execution." Brian Truitt, however, liked it. "Suicide Squad is an excellently quirky, proudly raised middle finger to the staid superhero-movie establishment" with "shades of Guardians of the Galaxy and the original Ghostbusters," he writes at USA Today. Smith finds his "best role in years" and Margot Robbie has her "star-making turn" as Harley Quinn. And though Leto's Joker can't compare to Heath Ledger's version, "it definitely works." (Here's another reviewer who thinks "Suicide Squad kinda sucks.")
Summary: Suicide Squad has received mixed reviews from critics, with a 27% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes compared to a 74% rating from viewers, with some critics praising its quirky tone and performances while others find it to be a disappointing and poorly executed film.
Story: – At the very least, it would have been an easy $2,000. That's how much cash was in the envelope that 23-year-old Brian DiCarlo found in a strip-mall parking lot in Clackamas, Oregon, reports KATU-TV. It also had a cashier's check for $38,000, money for a house down payment by the woman who had dropped it (and was going crazy trying to find it). Luckily for Sharon Davis, DiCarlo turned the money into police, and they were able to track her down, reports KPTV-TV. "This is all for her stuff," says DiCarlo. "If she loses it, I mean, she can’t do what she was hoping to do and so I would have hoped that someone would have done it for me." Davis gave him a $300 reward for his honesty. “I was so stunned and so stressed, I swear I was going to have a heart attack or a stroke," she says.
Summary: A man found an envelope containing $2,000 and a cashier's check for $38,000 in a strip-mall parking lot in Oregon, which he turned over to police, who were able to locate the owner, a woman named Sharon Davis, who rewarded him with $300 for his honesty.
Story: – Cary, North Carolina, is courting controversy with its speaker choice for the annual MLK Dreamfest Celebration in January, reports the New Observer. The city has invited former NAACP leader Rachel Dolezal, who triggered a national conversation about race and identity last year when it was revealed that she had presented herself as black even though she was born to white parents, to participate on a panel. The controversy forced her from her post as president of the Spokane, Wash., chapter of the NAACP. On Twitter, Dolezal said she was looking forward to attending the event. The announcement of Dolezal's participation has renewed the conversation surrounding her, with several citizens and media outlets calling for Cary to "rethink this," as Paul Blest at IndyWeek put it. Cary City Council is divided, with people speaking out on both sides of the issue. Festival organizers hope the event will give people the "opportunity to see her in a different light," and ignite discussions about the wider role of race and self-identity. The MLK Dreamfest Celebration will run from January 14 to 16 with the theme of "Healing Race Relations through Conversation and Participation."
Summary: Former NAACP leader Rachel Dolezal has been invited to participate in a panel at Cary, North Carolina's MLK Dreamfest Celebration, despite controversy surrounding her identity and race, with some calling for the event to be canceled and others hoping it will spark discussions on race and identity.
Story: – On Monday, Israeli celebrity chef Segev Moshe proudly posted a pic on Instagram showing off his latest creation: what looked to be a man's shoe filled with a "chocolate selection from the world." Per the Washington Post, it was Moshe's dessert offering for a May 2 dinner he oversaw for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, wife Sara, and their guests of honor: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, who were making their second official visit to Israel. Observers were quick to point out, however, one big problem with Moshe's display of confections, as explained by an anonymous senior Israeli official who has served in Japan to the Yediot Aharonot newspaper, via the Jerusalem Post: "There is nothing more despised in Japanese culture than shoes." That belief extends to etiquette that requires taking off one's shoes before entering a Japanese home. The official says that Moshe's dish was "stupid," "insensitive," and "equivalent to serving a Jewish guest chocolates in a dish shaped like a pig." A Japanese diplomat adds "we were offended on behalf of our prime minister." Abe was said to have handled the incident "gracefully," however, per USA Today, and a source tells YA that Abe and his wife even invited Moshe to come whip something up in Japan, per the Times of Israel. Meanwhile, Moshe's publicist says in a statement that what the chocolates were served in was a "high-quality piece of art made of cast metal in the shape of a shoe," a creation by artist Tom Dixon. "It is not a real shoe." (Why a dot on a mousse dish recently made Japan furious.)
Summary: Israeli chef Segev Moshe caused offense when he served chocolates in a shoe-shaped dish at a dinner for Israeli and Japanese leaders, as shoes are considered disrespectful in Japanese culture.
Story: – With the US election over and Syrian rebels seemingly gaining momentum, the Obama administration is taking a fresh look at its own potential involvement in the conflict, the New York Times reports. First, Washington must consider whether NATO should install surface-to-air missiles in Turkey, which some see as a deterrent to Syrian Air Force attacks near the border. Another possibility: Directly arming the rebel forces, instead of supplying weapons through countries like Qatar. Recent rebel successes have lent "a new urgency, and a new focus" to the debate in Washington, says an official. What's more, "the administration has figured out" that if it doesn't get involved before the war ends, "they won’t have influence with the fighters, and the fighters will control the territory," says a defense expert. In other Syria news: If the rebels want Western support, they'll need a transitional government, and quickly, notes the Christian Science Monitor, and yesterday saw the first meeting of Syria's new opposition coalition. "The objective is to name a prime minister, or at least have a list of candidates ahead of the Friends of Syria meeting" that's coming up, says a vice president. But the meeting was rife with disagreement. Russia appears to be sneaking helicopters to Syrian forces, Time reports. Documents leaked by Anonymous show an apparent flight plan to deliver choppers via travel over Iran, Iraq, and Azerbaijan—thus avoiding countries that have a weapons embargo against Syria. "It’s getting to Syria by the back door," says an expert.
Summary: The Obama administration is reassessing its involvement in the Syrian conflict, considering options such as installing surface-to-air missiles in Turkey or directly arming rebel forces, as recent rebel successes have added urgency to the debate and the administration seeks to maintain influence over the post-conflict territory.
Story: – This is, apparently, not a joke: Mitt Romney will fight boxer Evander Holyfield. In the Salt Lake Tribune, Paul Rolly calls it the "marquee event" of a black-tie evening involving several other bouts on May 15 in Salt Lake City, meant to raise money for Charity Vision. The humanitarian organization was founded by a fellow Mormon who happens to be friends with Romney. "It will either be a very short fight, or I will be knocked unconscious," Romney, 68, said recently of his boxing debut. "It won't be much of a fight. We'll both suit up and get in the ring and spar around a little bit."
Summary: Mitt Romney, a 68-year-old former presidential candidate, will box against boxer Evander Holyfield in a charity event in Salt Lake City on May 15, with the two men set to spar for a few rounds despite Romney's lack of boxing experience.
Story: – A veteran dropped some knowledge on an anonymous, misogynistic note-leaver who tried to shame her for parking in a veterans-only space Monday in North Carolina, Mashable reports. When Rebecca Landis Hayes finished shopping at a Harris Teeter grocery store in Concord, she returned to her car to find a note on her windshield. The note read: "This parking is for veterans, lady. Learn to read and have some respect." Landis Hayes posted the note to Facebook with her response. “I’m sorry that you can’t see my eight years of service in the United States Navy," she wrote. "I’m sorry that your narrow misogynistic world view can’t conceive of the fact that there are female veterans. I’m sorry that I have to explain myself to people like you.” She ends the post, which has been shared more than 2,500 times, with a question for whoever left the note: "I served, did you?" WCNC reports Harris Teeter has apologized to Landis Hayes. And a local veterans group has spoken out against the note, according to WSOC. (Hundreds attended the funeral of a veteran with no family.)
Summary: A veteran named Rebecca Landis Hayes was left a note on her car windshield in a veterans-only parking space, with the note shaming her for parking there as a woman, to which she responded by sharing the note on Facebook and questioning the note-leaver's military service.
Story: – The uncertain fate of Netflix's House of Cards is now a certain one: Production on the sixth season, which was put on ice at the end of October following a slew of sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey, will resume after the holidays. It will be the show's final season and consist of eight episodes, all absent Spacey, reports Variety. The Hollywood Reporter notes the season was originally supposed to clock in at 13 episodes and that production had been finished on episodes one and two when things were halted. Chief content officer Ted Sarandos announced the news Monday and explained how glad he was an agreement could be reached for the sake of the 370 people who work directly on the show and "the 2,000 people in Baltimore," where it's shot, who have some kind of employment because of it. The Hollywood Reporter's take: "Writing Spacey out of House of Cards isn't a stretch. In the Michael Dobbs book that inspired the Netflix series, Frank's character dies." No word on plot yet, but the episodes will revolve around Robin Wright.
Summary: Production on the final season of Netflix's "House of Cards" will resume after the holidays with eight episodes, all without Kevin Spacey, after the show's creative team reached an agreement to complete the season for the sake of the 370 direct employees and 2,000 people in Baltimore who work on the show.
Story: – When fans disagreed over scoring at an Indonesian boxing match yesterday, a fight broke out—followed by a stampede to exit the stadium that left at least 17 dead and 39 injured, Reuters reports. Most of the dead were women. Some 1,500 attended the match in Papua province, though the stadium capacity was only 800, the BBC reports, and the venue had just two working exits. "There were military and police personnel present in the stadium, but with so many people panicking ... the situation quickly got out of control," says a police official. Backers of the match's loser threw chairs at fans of the winner. So far, there are no suspects in the incident, but 13 people are being questioned.
Summary: At an Indonesian boxing match in Papua province, a fight broke out and led to a stampede that left at least 17 dead and 39 injured, with most of the dead being women, and the incident was exacerbated by the limited number of exits and the panic caused by fans of the losing team throwing chairs at those of the winning team.
Story: – As experts warn of the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant "superbugs," one culprit is the drugs used to treat farm animals. McDonald's is now taking a step to fix the issue: The restaurant chain's US operation will no longer use chicken that's been treated with human antibiotics, Reuters reports. The company plans to make the change within two years. "We're listening to our customers," says an executive, noting that the chain will cooperate with suppliers like Tyson Foods in the effort. McDonald's, Reuters notes, is the biggest restaurant chain on earth, and the shift could be a "tipping point for antibiotic use in the poultry industry," says an expert. Just three days ago, McDonald's got a new CEO, Steve Easterbrook, the Wall Street Journal reports. Easterbrook has said he wants to turn McDonald's into a "modern, progressive burger company," calling himself an "internal activist." The restaurants will still use chicken that is treated with ionophores, antibiotics used only on animals; that puts McDonald's a step behind Chipotle and Panera Bread. Chick-Fil-A has also announced plans to halt the use of chicken raised using antibiotics within five years, the Journal notes. McDonald's changes, at least for now, don't apply to its operations outside the US. (A new drug offers more good news in the fight against superbugs.)
Summary: McDonald's has announced that it will stop using chicken treated with human antibiotics in its US operations within two years, following customer demand and expert warnings about the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant "superbugs."
Story: – The Fed's controversial plan to buy $600 billion worth of Treasuries to stimulate growth has brought the phrase "quantitative easing" out from the obscurity of financial blogs. Will it work? Two columns today on the subject from Ben Bernanke himself in the Washington Post and Felix Salmon at Reuters: Bernanke: The Fed chief offers three examples of how the move will help: It will lower mortgage rates and thus help prospective homebuyers or those who want to refinance; it will encourage business investment by lowering corporate bond rates; and it will raise stock prices, which will in turn boost consumer wealth, confidence, and spending "in a virtuous circle." Salmon: Sorry, but lower rates will have a "decidedly marginal" effect on the housing market and business investment. As for boosting stock prices, "surely if we’ve learned anything from Greenspan’s mistakes it’s that the Fed shouldn’t be trying to support stock prices, and that attempts to do so are liable to end in tears." He doesn't like that Bernanke addressed (and largely dismissed) only the threat of inflation, without mentioning other potential costs such as "currency-related difficulties" for investors. All in all, he wishes Bernanke had called a press conference to answer questions rather than writing an op-ed.
Summary: The Federal Reserve's plan to buy $600 billion in Treasuries to stimulate growth has sparked debate, with former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke arguing it will lower mortgage rates and boost stock prices, while financial columnist Felix Salmon is skeptical of its effectiveness, citing potential costs such as currency-related difficulties for investors.
Story: – Ethan Couch got "no party, no cake, no ice cream" when he turned 19 on Monday, and on Wednesday, he got something quite a bit worse. The so-called "Affluenza Teen" was sentenced to four consecutive 180-day terms in Tarrant County jail by state District Judge Wayne Salvant during Couch's first appearance in adult court. The AP explains that the Fort Worth judge was able to hand out more jail time as part of the conditions of Couch's adult probation. The four terms relate to four counts of intoxication manslaughter, reports the AP; Couch killed four people and severely injured several others in a DUI crash in 2013. ABC News reports that Salvant did say the total term—10 days short of two years—could change. The Dallas Morning News backs that up with this quote from Salvant: "Nothing I do is in stone, so I might reconsider." He said both sides could make their arguments in coming weeks. But Salvant was clear about one point: "You're not getting out of jail today," he told Couch, per NBC News, which notes the case will resume in two weeks. The AP notes it isn't clear if Couch's 720 days will include time already served.
Summary: Ethan Couch, the "Affluenza Teen" who killed four people in a DUI crash in 2013, was sentenced to four consecutive 180-day terms in jail by a Texas judge, with the possibility of the term being reconsidered in coming weeks.
Story: – North Korea defied international warnings and launched a long-range rocket that the UN and others call a cover for a banned test of technology for a missile that could strike the US mainland. The rocket was fired from North Korea's west coast and tracked separately by the governments Japan and South Korea, which immediately convened an emergency national security council meeting, reports the AP. South Korean media reported that the rocket may have failed, but provided no other details. The launch follows North Korea's widely disputed claim last month to have tested a hydrogen bomb. This time, the North had said it was launching a satellite, reports CNN. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the launch and the weapons test violations of UN agreements. "We absolutely cannot allow this," he told reporters at the prime minister's residence. "We will take action to totally protect the safety and well-being of our people." A South Korean defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the rocket disappeared from South Korean military radars around six minutes after its launch. The official said there were no immediate reports of debris landing on South Korean territory or damaging property. The rocket's first stage fell off South Korea's west coast, the official said.
Summary: North Korea launched a long-range rocket despite international warnings, which was tracked by Japan and South Korea and may have failed, with the launch following its disputed hydrogen bomb test last month and prompting condemnation from Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who vowed to protect the safety and well-being of his people.
Story: – Something stinks in one southeastern New Mexico town and residents want police on the case. KRQE-TV in Albuquerque reports skunk smell is plaguing the town of Hagerman thanks to a mild winter that is bringing out the smelling mammals early. Viola Badcock, the owner of Hagerman Township Animal Shelter, says the annoying animals are hanging in town and generally are not healthy. She says their stink appears to be a growing problem. Hagerman Police Patrolman Adam Chavez says officers are settling up traps around the town, which has a population of 1,200, and in nearby Lake Arthur and Dexter, reports the AP. Chavez says healthy skunks caught in traps will be relocated on the east side of town near a river—but the traps have yet to bear fruit: Fox News reports they've thus far snared a dozen cats, four dogs, and a house rabbit. In the meantime, Fox News reports that "skunk carcasses are strewn all over the town’s streets," so much so that it claims you'll see at least one on any given street. "We're finding a bunch of dead ones on the road almost nightly now," says Chavez.
Summary: A skunk smell is plaguing the town of Hagerman in southeastern New Mexico due to a mild winter, with residents reporting a growing problem of dead skunks strewn on the streets and healthy skunks trapped in town and nearby areas.
Story: – The tone of the worst mass shooter in American history ranges from calm to nervous to irritated in a series of 911 calls released by police Monday. In the calls, Orlando gunman Omar Mateen, who called 911 from inside the Pulse nightclub, can be heard pledging allegiance to ISIS, calling himself an Islamic soldier, and describing the massacre as revenge for American bombing in Iraq and Syria, CBS reports. He hung up on police several times. A negotiator who identifies himself as Andy deals calmly and professionally with Mateen, though during one attempt to call him back, Andy tells fellow officers that he's not convinced the man he's dealing with is really inside the nightclub, the Orlando Sentinel reports. Mateen becomes impatient as the negotiator tries to obtain information, telling him it's "none of his business" whether he has an accomplice. At one point, he claims to have vehicles full of bombs outside the nightclub. "Your people are going to get it and I’m going to ignite it if they try to do anything stupid," says Mateen, who was shot dead by police at the end of an attack that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. The AP reports that audio of the calls was released by order of Circuit Judge Margaret Schreiber, who is still considering whether to release another 232 calls to 911 made during the incident. The city of Orlando's lawyers say they shouldn't be made public because they involve suffering and killing.
Summary: Omar Mateen, the gunman responsible for the worst mass shooting in American history, made 911 calls from inside the Pulse nightclub, during which he pledged allegiance to ISIS, called himself an Islamic soldier, and described the massacre as revenge for American bombing in Iraq and Syria, while also expressing impatience and irritation with the negotiator attempting to obtain information from him.
Story: – It looks like the US won't have a reformed tax system by Labor Day after all. Steven Mnuchin tells the Financial Times that having a tax reform bill ready for President Trump's signature by August is "not realistic at this point." Two months ago, the Treasury secretary said the administration hoped to have tax reform done by the time Congress goes on recess in August, CBS News reports. The Los Angeles Times notes it's a known fact that lawmakers get more done when they have a vacation coming up. But Mnuchin says the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act pretty much blew up that timetable. While Mnuchin says he still expects tax reform to happen sometime in 2017, there's no guarantee that's realistic either. The last major tax reform effort—back in the 1980s—took more than two years. The setback means US companies will have a harder time planning their budgets, as it's uncertain they'll get that Trump-promised lower tax rate. Trump's tax reform plan calls for lowering taxes for both businesses and individuals. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, says that won't increase the US deficit because the money lost from lower taxes will be offset by economic growth.
Summary: The US may not have a reformed tax system by Labor Day as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has stated that it is "not realistic at this point" due to the failure to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, despite earlier hopes to have it done by August.
Story: – Sen. Robert Menendez yesterday once again denied allegations that he had hired Dominican prostitutes, after an FBI raid on a major campaign donor's office rekindled interest in the rumors. On Tuesday, FBI agents descended on the offices of Dr. Salomon Melgen, the optometrist who supposedly flew the New Jersey Democrat to the Dominican Republic for his illicit trysts. The Miami Herald reports that the raid on Melgen's office was for an unrelated Medicare fraud investigation—though sources say the bureau is also working on a separate corruption investigation involving Menendez and Melgen. Menendez says Melgen did indeed fly him to the Dominican, but that those trips were "paid for and reported appropriately," the LA Times reports. He says the prostitution allegations "are manufactured by a politically motivated right-wing blog and are false." In a Breitbart post, Matthew Boyle, who originally broke the prostitution story, says he now has emails between the FBI and his original source offering to fly the source to Miami to talk. The Herald says an ethics group got the FBI in contact with Boyle's source, but that the group suspected the allegations were politically motivated.
Summary: Sen. Robert Menendez denied allegations of hiring Dominican prostitutes after an FBI raid on a campaign donor's office reignited interest in the rumors, with Menendez claiming the trips were "paid for and reported appropriately" and denying the allegations as "manufactured" and "false."
Story: – Donald Trump called out the six-pointed stars on a Frozen coloring book amid his own Star of David controversy, and Frozen star Kristen Bell was having none of that. "Zip it Don & get ur head outta ur ass. We've more important things 2 think abt today #AltonSterling #PhilandoCastile," Bell tweeted Thursday (before the police killings in Dallas, Vanity Fair notes). Trump didn't directly respond, but on Friday morning, he appeared to address all of this week's tragedies in one tweet: "Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country." On Facebook, he specifically mentioned Sterling, Castile, and the Dallas shootings as an example of how "divided" America has become, adding that "we must restore law and order." He also postponed a speech on economic opportunity he had planned for Friday. (Here's a list of celebrities who've threatened to leave the country if Trump is elected president.)
Summary: Donald Trump was criticized by Kristen Bell for using six-pointed stars from a Frozen coloring book during a controversy surrounding his own use of a Star of David, and he responded by mentioning recent police killings and calling for "law and order" restoration, while also postponing a speech on economic opportunity.
Story: – March 14, 2005, was a day like any other for William, a 38-year-old member of the British Armed Forces stationed in Germany. He got up, went to the gym, played volleyball, and answered emails from his office. By 2:40pm, he was sitting in a dentist’s chair for a root canal. And that’s essentially where he’s been ever since—at least in his mind, reports the BBC. Diagnosed with anterograde amnesia—a condition that keeps him from forming new memories and learning procedural skills—the father of two can’t remember anything for longer than 90 minutes and begins every day believing it's March 14, 2005. Now when he wakes, he reads a detailed note on his phone, titled "First thing—read this," and attempts to grasp all that has happened over the last decade. Unlike patients who've suffered similar fates after surgery, William's brain is undamaged. "We do not know what to make of it," a researcher tells Medical Daily. Doctors don’t think his case is linked to psychological stress either. Though the Gulf War vet had just lost his grandfather, he had no history of mental illness. Plus, psychogenic memory loss usually keeps patients from recollecting painful memories, not from creating new ones. In William's case, "it's as if the memories are being written in sand. Every hour and a half the tide comes up and washes them away," reports the Washington Post. The best explanation has to do with the consolidation of memories, the process of shipping events to long-term storage. It requires restructuring synapses, and the change takes about 90 minutes. Doctors say this might explain five other cases of anterograde amnesia found in patients who had a medical emergency. They may even carry a genetic predisposition. But why did a root canal perhaps trigger it? "That's the million-pound question," says a researcher, "and I don’t have an answer." (Read about another medical mystery involving one family' four kids.)
Summary: A 38-year-old British soldier stationed in Germany, William, has been diagnosed with anterograde amnesia, a condition that prevents him from forming new memories and learning procedural skills, causing him to wake up every day believing it is still March 14, 2005, and forgetting everything that has happened since.
Story: – Syria's Bashar al-Assad addressed his country's new parliament on Tuesday, and he sounded very much like a confident ruler with no plans to step down. “Just like we liberated Palmyra and many other areas before it, we are going to liberate each and every inch of Syria from their hands,” he said, referring both to the Islamic State and US-backed insurgents fighting him separately, per USA Today. The defiant speech comes in the wake of the collapse of peace talks in Geneva, which failed in part because Assad rejected a rebel demand that he give up power. Some related coverage of the speech: Al-Jazeera: "Assad's comments were a far cry from remarks he made last July when he conceded that his army was facing a series of setbacks on the battlefield and was being forced to relinquish certain areas. However, the scales of war have tipped in Assad's" favor. Washington Post: "His tough words came amid indications that Russia is preparing to reengage in the war in support of Assad. ... The violence has already been ticking up, with government and Russian warplanes conducting air raids over northern Syria in the past week and rebels launching an offensive to recapture territory south of the city of Aleppo." New York Times: "Assad’s defiance was notable partly because of efforts in recent months by Secretary of State John Kerry and other leaders of a 17-nation collaboration, known as the International Syria Support Group, to set a series of deadlines and limits that Syria could not violate. Every one of the directives has been broken." Middle East Eye: "During the speech, Assad also appeared to harden his position on UN-sponsored peace talks, saying that Syria will be ruled by a 'unity government'—not a 'transitional governing body' without Assad as president, a central demand of the opposition."
Summary: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad vowed to recapture all of Syria from ISIS and US-backed insurgents in a defiant speech to parliament, despite recent setbacks and the collapse of peace talks in Geneva.
Story: – A bill awaiting President Trump's signature has angered China so much that the state-run China Daily warns it could trigger war over the island Beijing still considers a renegade province. The Taiwan Travel Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous consent Thursday and earlier passed the House without opposition, states that "the US government should encourage visits between US and Taiwanese officials at all levels." In China, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying says Beijing "resolutely opposes" the bill and has already "lodged stern representations with the US side," the South China Morning Post reports. The bill allows high-level Taiwanese officials to enter the US "under respectful conditions." China's Taiwan Affairs Office issued a warning to the island: "Do not rely on foreigners to build yourselves up, or it will only draw the fire upon you." Reuters reports that the China Daily's editorial predicted that Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen would push for greater sovereignty if the bill becomes law, triggering China's 2005 law that allows it to use force "to prevent the island from seceding." "Since the US is bound by domestic law to act on behalf of the island in that instance, it would only give substance to the observation that the descent into hell is easy," it said. (Last year, China called a $1.4 billion US-Taiwan arms deal "the wrong move.")
Summary: The Taiwan Travel Act, which has angered China, could lead to a war over Taiwan as it encourages high-level Taiwanese officials to visit the US and potentially seek greater sovereignty, according to China's state-run media and a 2005 law that allows China to use force to prevent Taiwan's secession.
Story: – A 23-year-old Canadian backpacker was murdered by the same three drifters who killed a hiker found clutching the leash of his dog in Marin County, Calif., police say. When authorities caught up with Morrison Lampley, 23; Sean Angold, 24; and Lila Allgood, 18, at a Catholic church soup kitchen in Portland, Ore., on Wednesday, they say they not only found the gun that killed Steve Carter, 67, but also the property of Audrey Carey of Quebec. She was found dead in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park last Saturday, per the San Francisco Chronicle. Police initially said Carey, who had just set out on her first solo backpacking trip, suffered blunt force trauma to the head. However, a medical examiner later found the trauma was a gunshot wound, reports NBC Bay Area. "The three suspects will be charged with the robbery and murder of Audrey Carey," a police rep adds. Police say the slayings were similar as both occurred in wooded or park areas. Carter, a tantra teacher and massage therapist, moved to Costa Rica in December with his wife to build their dream home but returned to California in July when his wife was diagnosed with a rare form of breast cancer. Carter had been staying with friends when he went out to walk his Doberman pinscher on a popular fire trail near Fairfax on Monday; police say his murder was a "crime of opportunity." Court records show Lampley previously pleaded guilty to the unlawful selling or receiving of a stolen vehicle. (Police tracked the three suspects using GPS.)
Summary: A 23-year-old Canadian backpacker, Morrison Lampley, was murdered by three drifters, Sean Angold, 24, Lila Allgood, 18, who also killed a hiker found clutching the leash of his dog in Marin County, California, and a Canadian woman, Audrey Carey, 25, found dead in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, with both murders occurring in wooded or park areas.
Story: – The creators of Lara Croft have tried to add some depth to their character's back story for an upcoming game reboot, and Mary Hamilton at the Guardian is among many crying foul. For one thing, Lara is subjected to a beating and attempted rape, the latter generally a "lazy shorthand that allows a writer to paint a bad guy as particularly bad, and a woman as particularly vulnerable." It's a shame, writes Hamilton, because Lara—despite her gravity-defying bosom—has evolved into an interesting, tough female character and the new story line demeans her. She needs this history to explain her actions? One executive producer explains that game designers want players to "root for her in a way that you might not root for a male character." They want players to protect Lara, instead of just playing the game via her avatar. "It's hard to see that as anything other than a sexist approach, an assumption that men can't lose themselves in stories with female protagonists and/or that female gamers simply don't exist," writes Hamilton. Adds Tom Mendelsohn at the Independent: "This is weak storytelling; women, being people too, can have their personalities and motivations shaped through avenues other than their genitals."
Summary: The creators of the upcoming Lara Croft game have faced criticism for adding a traumatic backstory of sexual assault to the character's characterization, with some arguing that it demeans her evolution into a tough and interesting female character and reinforces sexist assumptions about female gamers.
Story: – A young nurse in Colorado is in custody, charged with trying to support ISIS militants fighting in Iraq and Syria, authorities say. According to newly unsealed court records, 19-year-old Shannon Maureen Conley told FBI investigators she had met a Tunisian militant online and agreed to be his wife and work as a nurse in an ISIS camp near the Turkish border, reports CNN. She was arrested when she tried to board a flight out of the country in early April and has been in custody since, accused of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and conspiring to commit an offense against the US, Reuters reports. The teen first came to the attention of authorities last year, when she was reported for behaving strangely at a Baptist church, the Denver Post reports. She was interviewed by the FBI multiple times and told them that she was "ready to wage jihad," according to court documents. Earlier this year, she underwent military tactics and firearms training with the US Army Explorers. In what federal agents describe as frank and open conversations, Conley was warned repeatedly that her plans to travel to the Middle East could result in her arrest but she didn't waver, even after agents contacted her parents in an attempt to moderate her views.
Summary: A 19-year-old nurse in Colorado, Shannon Maureen Conley, has been charged with attempting to support ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria after she was arrested at an airport while trying to leave the country and admitted to meeting a Tunisian militant online and agreeing to work as a nurse in an ISIS camp.
Story: – Though she hasn't done an interview in three years, Halle Berry graces the cover, and pages, of Vogue's September issue because "what that means for a woman of color and what that means in the fashion world, what that means to pop culture, there was no way I could say, 'No I'm not going to be on the biggest issue of the year.'" More from the interview: She loves being naked: "If the world wouldn’t persecute me, I’d take nude pictures every day of the week." She also loves daughter Nahla: "Best thing that ever happened to me." Why she's been so silent: "I was burned-out with having other people tell the story about me that they wanted to tell. I told my publicist, 'I'm not going to talk anymore. I'm just going to live my life and be who I am.'" On her breakup with Gabriel Aubry: "There is no discord, there is no fighting. It's just that you realize you are not meant to go the distance with everybody. We were meant to bring this amazing little person into the world. And I think that's why we came together. And because of that, we are going to be together forever, all three of us. We are a family until we are not here anymore." For more from the interview, and to see her cover photo, click here.
Summary: Halle Berry graces the cover of Vogue's September issue, discussing her love for nudity, motherhood, and why she's been quiet in the past, stating that she's been burned out by others telling her story and now wants to live her life on her own terms.
Story: – Democrats' support for gay marriage appears to be gaining momentum ahead of two key Supreme Court cases this week. Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia have joined Missouri's Claire McCaskill in endorsing gay marriage, leaving just 11 Democrat senators still opposed, Time reports. "Like so many of my generation, my views on allowing gay couples to marry have been challenged in recent years by a new, more open generation," Rockefeller tells ABC. "I support marriage equality because it is the fair and right thing to do," Warner wrote on his Facebook page. "Like many Virginians and Americans, my views on gay marriage have evolved, and this is the inevitable extension of my efforts to promote equality and opportunity for everyone." Out of the 11 Democrat senators who haven't endorsed gay marriage, three—Tim Johnson, Joe Manchin, and Mark Pryor, all in conservative states—bluntly restated their opposition, three declined to comment, and five signaled that they have a more moderate stance, Time finds.
Summary: Eleven Democratic senators have not endorsed gay marriage, with three explicitly stating their opposition and five expressing a more moderate stance, while several other Democrats, including Senators Mark Warner and Jay Rockefeller, have recently endorsed the issue.
Story: – Since NFL player Colin Kaepernick first refused to stand for the national anthem in August, he (and other protesters in the sports arena who've followed suit) has had his share of supporters and detractors. Count Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the latter category after a Yahoo interview Monday with Katie Couric in which she was asked about the patriotically-tinged hubbub. "I think it's dumb and disrespectful," she said, per Mediaite, adding she'd say the same thing about burning an American flag. "I think it's a terrible thing to do, but I wouldn't lock a person up for doing it." She also calls such protests "arrogant," though she adds, per the Independent, that it would be "dangerous to arrest people for conduct that doesn’t jeopardize the health or well-being of other people." Barry Petchesky at Deadspin labels her commentary as "gross," saying, "And here I was thinking these athletes have played a pretty significant role in reigniting an important national discussion." A (somewhat) sympathetic commenter on the site, however, notes: "Eh, I know I probably shouldn't, but I tend to give people who lived through WW2 a little bit of leeway on being stupid about this sort of thing." (Watch the interview with Couric at Yahoo.)
Summary: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has criticized NFL player Colin Kaepernick and other athletes who have protested during the national anthem, calling their actions "dumb and disrespectful" and suggesting that they should not be arrested for their protests.
Story: – Could a failed lawsuit be another piece of the Stephen Paddock puzzle? Video has emerged of the Las Vegas gunman slipping and falling in the city's Cosmopolitan Hotel in 2011, the New York Daily News reports. Paddock, who shot through the windows of another casino to massacre 59 people Sunday night, claimed to have slipped in a puddle of liquid and sued the Cosmopolitan for $100,000 in compensation. According to court records, Paddock tore his hamstring in the fall and had $32,000 in medical bills. The case was dismissed after it went to arbitration in 2014. The arbitrator decided Paddock had failed to prove negligence. Investigators are still trying to determine Paddock's motive for the mass shooting. Paddock was on his way to a high-roller part of the casino at the time of the fall, though Marty Kravitz, an attorney for the Cosmopolitan, tells NBC News that when Paddock showed up for a deposition, he was "unkempt," slovenly," and "bizarre." At the time of the fall, Paddock "was wearing crappy flip-flops with a beverage in a bag in his hand," the attorney says. "You wonder what a guy like this is doing at the Cosmo." Kravitz says, however, that there were no signs Paddock was unstable. "This is not a guy that I would have looked at and thought, 'He's going to commit a crime one day," he says. (Paddock's girlfriend has returned to the US from overseas.)
Summary: Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas gunman, sued the Cosmopolitan Hotel in 2011 after slipping and falling, claiming $100,000 in compensation, but the case was dismissed due to lack of negligence proof.
Story: – John McCain has accused the White House of deliberately leaking information that could jeopardize national security in order to "paint a portrait of the president of the United States as a strong leader on national security issues." The senator, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, has called for an investigation of recent New York Times stories, including one about Obama's kill list, one on drone policies, and one on American cyberattacks on Iran's nuclear program, reports Roll Call. "This is not a proud day for the United States of America," McCain said. "Our friends are not the only ones who read the New York Times. Our enemies do, too." He said Armed Services Committee chairman Carl Levin has agreed to hold a hearing on the issue, Politico reports. Senate Intelligence Chairman Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, said she was "deeply disturbed" by the leaks, and has sent a letter to Obama making it clear "that disclosures of this type endanger American lives and undermine America’s national security."
Summary: Senator John McCain has accused the White House of leaking classified information to portray President Obama as a strong leader on national security issues, sparking calls for an investigation from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.
Story: – Texas authorities say five people have been killed following separate shootings that included a nursing home in a Corpus Christi suburb, the AP reports. Robstown City Secretary Herman Rodriguez says via Twitter that three people were killed Friday following a shooting at the Retama Manor nursing home. Two additional men were found dead in a home linked to that shooting. Rodriguez says officers responded to the nursing home about 7pm Friday and found two men and a woman dead. He says a phone call from family members prompted police to visit the residence of one of the nursing home victims, where two more men were found dead. The shooter was among those killed. Rodriguez say authorities believe the shootings are related but have not identified the victims or established a possible motive. The nursing home was still on lockdown Friday night, leaving residents and family to use a nearby high school, the Caller Times reports. "You never think it’s going to happen to your family," says a woman whose mother stays at the home. "You think they're safe."
Summary: Five people, including a nursing home resident, were killed in separate shootings in a Corpus Christi suburb, with the shooter among the deceased, and authorities believe the incidents are related but have not yet identified the victims or established a motive.
Story: – The Justice Department, under Eric Holder's orders, will investigate whether yesterday's shootings at two Kansas City Jewish sites broke the federal hate crimes law, the AP reports. Holder today issued a statement on the shootings, which ended with three dead, allegedly at the hands of white supremacist Frazier Glenn Cross, saying he was "horrified" by the murders, which "are all the more heartbreaking as they were perpetrated on the eve of the solemn occasion of Passover." President Obama also addressed the shootings at an Easter prayer breakfast at the White House this morning, the AP reports. "No one should ever have to fear for their safety when they go to pray," he said, noting that synagogues and temples across the nation are taking extra security precautions today. Meanwhile, hundreds gathered at an interfaith service in Kansas today to remember the victims, the Washington Post reports. Mindy Corporon, who lost both her father and her 14-year-old son, surprised the crowd by showing up to speak. "I know they’re in heaven together," she said of Dr. William Corporon and Reat Underwood.
Summary: The Justice Department will investigate whether yesterday's shootings at two Kansas City Jewish sites broke federal hate crimes law, with Attorney General Eric Holder issuing a statement expressing horror at the murders and President Obama calling for extra security precautions at houses of worship.
Story: – Are you sitting down? Because we are about to unleash some information on you that is all but impossible to believe: Kim Kardashian staged her now-failed marriage to Kris Humphries, according to her former publicist. "She knew weeks before getting married she didn't want to do it," said Jonathan Jaxson, who worked with the reality star from 2007 to 2009, on the Elvis Duran Morning Show. "She's never gotten over [ex Reggie Bush]." Jaxson claimed to have worked with Kardashian on similar stunts throughout their partnership in a bid to get her press, the New York Post reports. "I staged several of the moments that the world has seen of her, such as a ring that we alleged was from Reggie Bush," he said. "It was calculated to a T and then it was leaked to a magazine." Whether Jaxson speaks the truth or not, apparently you needn’t worry about Kim and Kris dragging this whole thing out: TMZ reports that the marriage is definitely over, despite Kim’s recent trip to Minnesota. And both MediaTakeOut and Australia’s Daily Telegraph report that she’s since been linked to Lance Gross, her co-star in an upcoming Tyler Perry film named (wait for it…) The Marriage Counselor.

Summary: Kim Kardashian staged her marriage to Kris Humphries with the help of her former publicist Jonathan Jaxson, who claims to have staged moments to get her press, including a fake engagement ring from ex-boyfriend Reggie Bush, and the marriage is now officially over despite Kim's recent trip to Minnesota.
Story: – The US Department of Agriculture is recalling more than 228,000 pounds of Spam and another product made by Minnesota-based Hormel after four consumers complained about metal objects in the food. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service says the canned chicken and pork in question was produced in February at the company's plant in Fremont, Nebraska. The agency says "minor oral injuries" have been reported, the AP reports. The recall covers 12-ounce metal cans containing "SPAM Classic" with a "Best By" date of February 2021. Those products were shipped throughout the US. The recall also includes 12-ounce metal cans of "Hormel Foods Black-Label Luncheon Loaf" with a "Best By" date of February 2021. Those products were shipped only to Guam.

Story: – A Satanist group has stolen a holy wafer from a Catholic church to use in an upcoming "black Mass," or so alleges a lawsuit filed yesterday by the Oklahoma City Catholic archbishop. Paul S. Coakley asked an Oklahoma County district court judge "to halt the desecration" of a stolen "Eucharistic Host," scheduled to be sacrificed on Sept. 21 at the Oklahoma City Civic Center Music Hall, reports the Oklahoman. Adam Daniels, who paid $420 to rent a basement theater in the civic center for five hours, is organizing a tamer version of a traditional black Mass, or the inversion of a Catholic Mass, for Dakhma of Angra Mainyu Syndicate, but it still involves a sacrifice to the devil. "A host is simply a piece of bread," the lawsuit reads. "However, a consecrated host—including the Consecrated Host that is the subject of this action—is a host that has undergone the transubstantiation and is now the body and blood of Jesus Christ. To Catholics, the consecrated host is the most sacred, respected, and revered thing in the world." Daniels, meanwhile, wouldn't tell the AP how he came to possess the wafer, but he says he didn't steal it and he shot back at Coakley, saying he'd sue for defamation. (Earlier this summer, the Vatican formally recognized a group of exorcists.)
Summary: A Satanist group has stolen a consecrated host from a Catholic church to use in an upcoming "black Mass," according to a lawsuit filed by the Oklahoma City Catholic archbishop, with the group organizer claiming he did not steal the host and plans to sue for defamation.
Story: – We’re always hearing that this wine goes with that food, and feel guilty when we get it wrong—but what if it’s all a scam? asks Jason Wilson in the Washington Post. A new study suggests it might be: More than 60% of wine sipped by “high-frequency wine drinkers”—those who drink wine several times weekly—isn’t accompanied by a meal. It just goes to show, argues wine blogger Alder Yarrow, that the chatter over correct pairings is propagated by the wine establishment, perhaps as a moneymaking move. "For every glass carefully chosen to go with a specific dish, there appear to eight more consumed in the same way most people drink a scotch," writes Yarrow at Vinography. “I can only barely imagine what might happen if wine writing and the attentions of wine lovers actually matched their real behavior,” muses Yarrow, who has for years called “correct” pairing a lie. “Would wine drinkers feel free to not only drink whatever they like, but to explore and experiment in their wine choices without fear of doing something wrong? Would more people actually drink wine because they knew it didn’t always HAVE to go with food?” (Click for more complaints about fancy wine talk.)
Summary: A new study suggests that the majority of wine consumed by frequent drinkers is not paired with food, challenging the conventional wisdom of wine pairing and raising questions about the motivations of the wine establishment.
Story: – Rebekah Brooks, the woman who ran Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper unit and is now facing criminal charges in its phone-hacking scandal, is going Hollywood. But not exactly in a good way. A new studio called BiteSize Entertainment is developing a feature film about Brooks and her fall from power, says the Hollywood Reporter. It will be based on Suzanna Andrews' Vanity Fair article about "mystery woman" Brooks, which, among other things, calls her the "fantasy daughter" of Murdoch, “the daughter he always wished he had, the one who never argued with him, who devoted her life to pleasing him." It's still so early in the process that no writer, director, or actors have been hired. The Telegraph, though, thinks Nicole Kidman would do nicely.
Summary: Rebekah Brooks, former head of Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper unit, is the subject of a forthcoming Hollywood film based on a Vanity Fair article, with Nicole Kidman being speculated as a potential lead actor.
Story: – Top Democrats circled the wagons today around the Affordable Care Act, with Kirsten Gillibrand offering what Politico calls "a stirring defense of the law." "The point is, if you are being offered a terrible health care plan that the minute you get sick you have to go into bankruptcy, those plans should never be offered," she said. President Obama "should have just been specific," when he said Americans could keep their plans. She dismissed 39 Democrats who voted with the GOP on a fix as "just responding to the worries of their constituents." (James Clyburn said they were "insulating themselves against soundbytes.") Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, said "Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act. This is an issue that has to be dealt with, but it doesn’t mean, 'Oh, it’s a political issue so we're going to run away from it.’ It’s too valuable for the American people." Of the president's comments Thursday, she said, "He is gracious and he is taking responsibility." Elsewhere, on your Sunday dial: Bob Woodward on the fumbled ObamaCare rollout: "What this is, it’s a mess, clearly, but what it isn’t, and I think you have to look at the question of motive. And the president’s motive here, even though there were deep problems with the implementation, he wants to do something good for 30 million people and get them health insurance. So this isn’t Watergate, this isn’t [Bill] Clinton and Monica Lewinsky." LBJ daughter Luci Baines Johnson on moving into the White House: "One night I heard my mother and father actually have raised voices. That was just not in their temperament. My mother was saying, 'No, Lyndon, we can’t. We just can’t.' And my father was saying ... firmly, 'Bird, we have to… We have to move on Dec. 7 because that’s the date that’s convenient to Mrs. Kennedy and to the Secret Service.' I didn’t understand that Dec. 7 was a date that would live in infamy for their generation. Nov. 22 had become that day for me." Kathleen Kennedy Townsend on whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone: "I don’t know, I don’t know. I’m not going to solve that problem and what I’m going to do is focus on things to make a difference. That was a really terrible time in our country’s legacy." Liz Cheney on gay marriage: "I love (openly gay sister) Mary very much, I love her family very much. This is just an issue on which we disagree. I believe in the traditional definition of marriage." The New York Times notes that Mary Cheney's wife has responded, calling Liz Cheney's comments "offensive to say the least," and warning that she's "on the wrong side of history." Scott Walker has seen the GOP's 2016 nominee, and ... "I think it's got to be an outsider, I think both the presidential and vice presidential nomination needs to be a former or current governor, people who have done successful things in their states, taken on big reforms, who are ready to move America forward." As for Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Marco Rubio, "All good guys, but it’s got be somebody who is viewed as being exceptionally removed from Washington."
Summary: Top Democrats defended the Affordable Care Act, with Kirsten Gillibrand arguing that people should not be offered "terrible" healthcare plans that can lead to bankruptcy, while Nancy Pelosi and others emphasized the law's value to the American people.
Story: – Dani Mathers says she became a Playboy model because she loves the female body. She had a funny way of showing it Thursday when she posted a photo to Snapchat of a nude woman in a locker room at an LA Fitness in Los Angeles, with the caption, "If I can't unsee this then you can't either." The 29-year-old, named Playboy's 2015 Playmate of the Year, then shared a selfie of herself covering her mouth, as though to hide a laugh. The backlash was hard and swift. The photo is "body shaming at its worst" and "maybe illegal," Kelsey Garcia writes at POPSUGAR. Twitter users, some of whom called on LA Fitness to ban Mathers, were equally outraged. "Shame on you," wrote one user. "Now we know who you really are. Can't unsee that either." In a series of Snapchat videos, Mathers later said she was "deeply sorry" and had only meant to share the photo with a friend, per the BBC. "I love the female body and I know that body shaming is wrong and that's not what I'm about," she added. In other words, "she knows body shaming is wrong, but was going to do it anyway—just privately," writes Sam Escobar at Good Housekeeping. Escobar also casts doubt on her claims of a posting oops, noting it's "extremely easy" to tell the difference between posting direct to a user versus to one's Snapchat story. Mathers has since deleted all of her social media accounts except for Facebook and says she will "take some time to myself now to reflect on why I did this horrible thing." LA Fitness tells TMZ that Mathers' "behavior is appalling and puts every member's privacy at risk. We have handled this internally and also notified the police." (Snapchat just got sued by a teen over sexually explicit content.)
Summary: Dani Mathers shared a nude photo of a woman in a locker room on Snapchat, sparking backlash for body shaming and potential legal action, despite her claims of only intending to share the photo with a friend.
Story: – A Banksy mural taken from a wall in north London was sold for over $1.1 million at a private auction last night. The piece, "Slave Labour," of a young boy sewing Union Jack flags, was sprayed onto the side of a store in 2012. It was removed in February this year, and was supposed to be sold off at an auction house in Miami, but was pulled from the auction at the last minute amid protests. But the sellers weren't fazed this time: the piece pulled in three bids over $1.1 million by champagne-sipping collectors at the members-only event, reports Bloomberg. Legally, graffiti is the property of the owner of the building it is painted onto. But many street art fans claim the pieces are intended to be enjoyed by the public, and should remain the property of all. One British politician called for "Slave Labour" to be returned to its original location. "You have deprived a community of an asset that was given to us for free and greatly enhanced an area that needed it," she said, as per the BBC. "I call on you, and your consciences, to pull the piece from both potential sales and return it to its rightful place."
Summary: A Banksy mural, "Slave Labour," sold for over $1.1 million at a private auction in London despite protests from street art fans who argue that the piece should remain public property.
Story: – Proposition 106 has passed in Colorado, making the state the nation's sixth to legalize assisted suicide, reports 9NEWS. Adults who are terminally ill, with less than six months to live, and found to be mentally competent, can request life-ending medication—a high dose of secobarbital used in sleeping pills—from a doctor, reports the Denver Post; those with dementia or Alzheimer's aren't eligible. The measure passed with two-thirds support with 63% of votes counted, per the Post. Advocates called it a "tremendous victory," while "disappointed" critics promised that "the fight is not over."
Summary: Proposition 106 in Colorado has legalized assisted suicide for terminally ill adults with less than six months to live, excluding those with dementia or Alzheimer's, after passing with two-thirds support.
Story: – Benjamin Netanyahu went on Israeli TV Monday night and issued a blunt accusation against the nation he sees as an arch-nemesis: "Iran lied," he declared. "Big time." Netanyahu said Israel had obtained a "half ton" of documents proving that Iran had been trying to develop nuclear weapons, something it has long denied, reports the AP. Netanyahu further asserted that Iran sought to cover up the weapons program before signing a 2015 deal with the international community. “Iran is brazenly lying when it said it never had a nuclear weapons program," said the Israeli prime minister. His office billed it as a bombshell development, though Tom DiChristopher of CNBC writes that Netanyahu's presentation "largely rehashed what the world long ago accepted: That Iran sought to develop nuclear weapons." Still, the timing is significant, given that President Trump must decide by May 12 whether to continue to go along with the 2015 deal or reimpose sanctions, reports the Guardian. The newspaper notes that Netanyahu spoke to Trump by phone over the weekend and met in person with new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday. "We've shared this material with the United States and the United States can vouch for its authenticity," Netanyahu said on Monday. Iran did not immediately respond to the claims, but its foreign minister tweeted before the presentation that Netanyahu is "the boy who can't stop crying wolf" in regard to accusations about Iran. Netanyahu said Israel had obtained 55,000 documents and 183 CDs from the "nuclear archives" of Iran.
Summary: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of lying about its nuclear weapons program, presenting what he claimed was evidence of Iran's attempts to develop nuclear weapons, including 55,000 documents and 183 CDs from Iran's "nuclear archives."
Story: – Melvyn Wilson won $500,000 in the Virginia lottery in 2004, so it was a surprise when he won $25,000 five months later. Six months after that, he scratched off a card to win $1 million. He retired shortly afterward, but the money keeps coming in for the 72-year-old former postal worker: Wilson has now won another $500,000. This was from Virginia's $20-a-ticket "Millionaire Mania," the Washington Post reports. All of Wilson's six-plus-figure winnings have come in scratch-off games. It's unclear how many tickets he's purchased total, but he says he enters every day but Sunday. “I’m just in the right place at the right time," he says, per InsideNoVa. So what does he do with all the money? "I invest in Melvyn," he says. Seems like a good bet. Meanwhile, the rest of us can hope for a sliver of Wilson's good luck ahead of Saturday's Powerball jackpot, which now stands at $475 million, the AP reports.
Summary: Melvyn Wilson, a 72-year-old former postal worker, has won over $1.7 million in Virginia lottery scratch-off games over the past few years, including $500,000 in 2004, $25,000 in 2005, $1 million in 2006, and another $500,000 in 2023, with all of his winnings coming from scratch-off games.

Story: – Esquire is here, as always, to tell us which woman is the sexiest one on the planet, and this year it's Emilia Clarke. Or, as you may know her, Game of Thrones' Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons. Anyway, the 28-year-old gives the magazine an interview in which she does not, shockingly, discuss how surprised she was to be named 2015's sexiest woman alive, but does discuss how she got the GoT role. "My agent calls me up and says, 'Did you ever go up for Game of Thrones?'" At that point, the pilot had already been filmed, but HBO was reconsidering the casting because people were unhappy with how it turned out. "My agent told the casting director, 'I know that the breakdown for this character is tall and willowy and blonde. I know she's short and round and brown, but I'd like you to see her,'" Clarke continues. "I had two scenes which told me nothing and not very much time in which to read all those [George R. R. Martin] books. So I did what every good actor does and Wikipedia'd the living crap out of it." (Meanwhile, sorry, there's no GoT movie in the works.)
Summary: Emilia Clarke, known for her role as Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones, reveals how she landed the role after her agent convinced the casting director to consider her despite her physical differences from the character's description, and how she prepared for the role by extensively researching the books.
Story: – Aydian Dowling is a 27-year-old guy who enjoys bodybuilding, has a YouTube channel called "Beefheads Fitness," and likes to go on hikes with his wife on his days "off" from working out. He's also transgender, and currently in the lead (way in the lead) of Men's Health magazine's "Ultimate Guy Search." The winner will appear on the November 2015 cover. The amount of support he's gotten since entering the contest is "crazy," the New York native, who now lives in Eugene, Ore., tells People. "I think I would have laughed if someone said that in five years I was going to be in a competition to be on the cover of Men's Health magazine. I would be like, 'No way would you be putting me shirtless on a magazine!'" He explains that he started bodybuilding "because I wanted my outer body to feel more masculine like my inner soul does," and soon after, "I started to feel better. You're forced in front of a mirror to make sure that you're doing an exercise properly, and after five days a week in front of a mirror, you start to get used to your body. You start to appreciate it." His YouTube channel is geared toward helping other transgender people on a similar journey, and he explains in his contest entry that he also trains local transgender males. "They have greatly progressed and I feel very proud to see their self-confidence grow," he says. As for winning, it's a complicated process: User votes are taken into account, but according to the rules, there are three more phases of the competition, and judges will make the ultimate decision in September. (Transgender rights recently got two new high-profile advocates.)
Summary: Aydian Dowling, a 27-year-old transgender man and bodybuilder, is in the lead in Mens Health magazine's "Ultimate Guy Search" contest, with a YouTube channel focused on helping other transgender people and training local transgender males, despite initially finding the idea of being on a shirtless magazine cover unthinkable.
Story: – Many of the details surrounding the execution of 10 aid workers, including six Americans, in Afghanistan are still being sorted out. But one of the victims, British surgeon Karen Woo, knew the dangers. "The trek will not be easy," she wrote beforehand of the journey to Nurestan, which entailed a 120-mile hike in the mountains. "The expedition will require a lot of physical and mental resolve and will not be without risk but ultimately, I believe that the provision of medical treatment is of fundamental importance and that the effort is worth it in order to assist those that need it most," wrote Woo, who was engaged to be married. She was traveling with a Christian group known as the International Assistance Mission when they were stopped, robbed, and murdered. The Taliban has claimed responsibility. The Washington Post and the Guardian have more details on Woo.
Summary: British surgeon Karen Woo and 9 others, including 6 Americans, were killed on a 120-mile hike in Afghanistan while traveling with a Christian group, with the Taliban claiming responsibility.
Story: – Soon, Starbucks will be more than just a place where you can get a Frappuccino and a croissant: It will also be a place where you can get some bacon-wrapped dates and a nice glass of Malbec. The COO recently revealed that the coffee chain has been testing its evening "alcohol and light bites" menu in select locations, and will be expanding it to thousands of stores, Businessweek reports. "This is a program that works," says Troy Alstead. "As we bring the evening program to stores, there’s a meaningful increase in sales during that time of the day." So far, alcohol has been sold at about 40 stores in Seattle, Chicago, Atlanta, LA, Portland, and DC. Other items on the menu, available after 4pm, include truffle macaroni and cheese, parmesan-crusted chicken skewers, and chocolate fondue. But don't get too excited: The rollout of the menu to more stores is expected to take several years, and only stores in urban areas—where people are likely to be out at night—will likely see the expansion. In other Starbucks news, the company will start selling "Oprah Chai" next month—yes, really. Winfrey helped to create the blend, the AP reports.
Summary: Starbucks is expanding its menu to include alcohol and light bites in select locations, with plans to roll it out to thousands of stores over several years, starting in urban areas.
Story: – Sunday saw the publication of a lengthy Kansas City Star investigation into the alleged rape of 14-year-old Daisy Coleman in Maryville, Mo., a case which saw authorities drop charges against a well-connected 17-year-old boy. Now, hackers are taking matters into their own hands, Time reports. "If Maryville won’t defend these young girls, if the police are too cowardly or corrupt to do their jobs, if (the) justice system has abandoned them, then we will have to stand for them," Anonymous says in a video statement. "Mayor Jim Fall, your hands are dirty. Maryville, expect us." "We demand an immediate investigation into the handling by local authorities of Daisy's case. Why was a suspect, who confessed to a crime, released with no charges? How was video and medical evidence not enough to put one of these football players inside a court room?" the group asks, though it does not specify what it might have planned. Anonymous recently took up the cause of Rehtaeh Parsons, a Canadian victim of alleged sexual assault who eventually killed herself; the group also helped bring attention to the Steubenville case, the Inquisitr and Time note. The group is calling its latest mission #OpMaryville, the Raw Story reports. Click for more on "Daisy's case."
Summary: Anonymous, a hacktivist group, has taken up the cause of 14-year-old Daisy Coleman, who was allegedly raped in Missouri, and is demanding an investigation into the local authorities' handling of the case after they dropped charges against a well-connected 17-year-old boy, threatening to take matters into their own hands.
Story: – Kids who suck their thumbs or bite their nails past preschool age may drive their parents crazy, but at least the habits appear to incur a health benefit: a reduced risk of allergies. So report researchers in a new study showing that the protective effect lasts into adulthood. Their findings add further credence to the "hygiene hypothesis," which suggests that early exposure to microbes can help strengthen a developing person's immune system, reports US News & World Report. And kids who both suck their thumbs and bite their nails seem to enjoy an even greater protective effect, reports Scientific American, which adds that a similar study in 2013 found that kids had a reduced risk of allergies if their parents sucked their pacifiers clean. While Dr. Robert Hancox, the paper's senior author out of New Zealand, says the benefits aren't strong enough to encourage kids into these habits, he adds that it's "difficult to imagine" what else would explain the decreased susceptibility to allergies his team found when looking at 1,000 New Zealand children into adulthood. Meanwhile, a pediatrician who reviewed the study said that this doesn't mean kids should "roll around in the dirt," but that adults can "loosen up a little" about cleanliness. By the way, one in three of the kids studied were either sucking their thumbs or biting their nails "frequently" between the ages of 5 and 11 and enjoyed being a third less likely to develop allergic sensitization than their peers by age 13; those numbers held through the study's conclusion, when they were 32. (This woman is allergic to her own sweat and tears.)
Summary: According to a new study, children who suck their thumbs or bite their nails past preschool age may have a reduced risk of allergies due to the "hygiene hypothesis," which suggests that early exposure to microbes can strengthen a developing immune system.
Story: – The outline of a naked "fertility" giant carved into the chalk of a steep English hillside is being linked to a baby boom in the surrounding community. Folklore has it that women who sleep somewhere on top of the 180-foot-long club-wielding Cerne Abbas giant—also known as the "Rude Man," not because all his junk's hanging out but because he's "rudely" or roughly cut—will be "blessed with fecundity." It's also said that infertility may be cured by having sex on the figure, particularly at the business intersection, reports the Telegraph. Now it turns out that the women of nearby Dorset have the highest birthrates in the nation with an average of three kids each, twice the rate of the rest of the country. Experts don't know when the huge figure was carved. Some link the giant to a Saxon deity, a Celtic British figure or the Roman Heracles. The earliest known written reference to the nude man was in 1684. The giant shared space in 2007 with a contemporary pal, semi-nude Homer Simpson, painted on the hill to advertise a Simpson movie. Neopagans were infuriated and threatened rain magic to wash Homer away.
Summary: A 180-foot-long "fertility" giant carved into an English hillside has been linked to a baby boom in the surrounding community, with women sleeping on or near the figure said to be blessed with fecundity, leading to the highest birthrates in the nation.
Story: – The Romanian women's gymnastics team has scored a medal in every Olympics since 1976, making it the longest Olympic medal streak in the sport—and one that has now been broken, reports NPR. The team failed to nab a spot at the Rio Olympics during a qualifying "test event" on Sunday when competitors fell on the uneven bars, beam, floor, and vault, reports the Guardian. Nancy Armour at USA Today calls it "a shocking downfall for Romania." The fact that Romania had to attend the event at all after finishing 13th at the 2015 World Gymnastics Championships was "a stunning embarrassment for a team that has been a gymnastics powerhouse for 40 years," she wrote in October, and the one that gave the world Nadia Comaneci. The loss of star Larisa Iordache, who recently broke a finger, clearly hurt the team. But legendary coach Octavian Bellu—who, along with Mariana Bitang, returned as a volunteer coach in advance of the Rio test event—blames the current crop of athletes. "I have the feeling they're not motivated enough or don't like the sport," he says. The publisher of International Gymnast Magazine, however, accuses the Romanian coaches of being "egocentric and stupid" and says Bellu and Bitang's decision not to attend the test event in Rio "would easily [breed] thoughts that this team was an embarrassment to them." Brazil, Germany, Belgium, and France will now join the US, Russia, Britain, China, Italy, Japan, Canada, and the Netherlands at the team event in Rio. One female gymnast from Romania will compete individually.
Summary: The Romanian women's gymnastics team, which has won a medal in every Olympics since 1976, failed to qualify for the Rio Olympics after falling during a qualifying event, with the team's coaches blaming a lack of motivation and ego clashes.
Story: – Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators that he and his brother originally planned their attack for July 4th—but they built their bombs so quickly that they moved the mission up to the day of the Boston Marathon, reports outlets including the New York Times, Boston Globe, and CBS News. All of the accounts are based on anonymous law-enforcement officials. Dzhokhar reportedly said the brothers first wanted to attack Boston's July 4th celebration on the Charles River. But when the bomb-making went so smoothly in Tamerlan's Cambridge apartment, they drove around the city casing police departments to attack, says the Globe. Eventually they settled on the marathon—Patriots' Day in the state. The brothers kicked around the idea of being suicide bombers but opted for pressure cookers instead, according to the Times. Dzhokhar also revealed that the brothers watched sermons by Anwar al-Awlaki over the Internet, but there is no evidence that they communicated directly with the radical US-born cleric before his death in 2011. Meanwhile, the Tsarnaev family has claimed Tamerlan's body.
Summary: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators that he and his brother originally planned to attack the Boston Marathon on July 4th but moved the date up due to the ease of building their bombs, with the brothers watching online sermons by Anwar al-Awlaki but lacking direct communication with him before his death in 2011.
Story: – An international campaign to spare an Iranian woman from hanging seemed to be working over the last month, with authorities granting Reyhaneh Jabbari a temporary stay. Today, though, the message on the campaign's Facebook page reads, "rest in peace," reports the Guardian. Iran's official IRNA news agency says the 26-year-old was hanged at dawn today for the killing of an intelligence official. Jabarri, then 19, maintained that she stabbed Morteza Abdolali when he tried to sexually assault her inside an apartment. Groups including Amnesty International say that the investigation was a joke and that her confession was obtained under duress, reports the BBC. Jabbari had been an interior designer, and Abdolali hired her to redesign his office. Her supporters say that she stabbed her assailant once in the shoulder and fled and that a second man in the building was the true killer. Abdolali's family insists the killing was premeditated and refused to offer last-minute clemency, which is allowed in Iran with sometimes dramatic results.
Summary: Reyhaneh Jabbari, an Iranian woman sentenced to death for killing an intelligence official, was hanged at dawn today despite an international campaign to spare her life, with Iranian authorities rejecting last-minute clemency requests.
Story: – "Keep up your work up there, keep looking for the missing and saving lives." It's an unusual message for a deceased dog, but an appropriate one for Kaos, a German shepherd credited with helping find survivors buried in Italy following a 6.2-magnitude earthquake that killed nearly 300 people in August 2016 and another 6.6-magniture temblor in October of that year, reports the Guardian. Labeled a hero, the dog met its own untimely end over the weekend in what owner Fabiano Ettore claims was a poisoning, per the BBC. There are "no words" to describe the grief following "such a horrible act," Ettore wrote in a Facebook post, shared more than 69,000 times, after finding Kaos dead in his garden in Sant'Eusanio Forconese on Saturday. Italian police, who say the dog fell ill while outside and died a short time later, are now investigating. Per Sky News, a 2014 report named poisonings as the second leading cause of canine deaths in Italy, and politicians are now using Kaos' death as a kind of rallying cry. Referring to the "terrible and unjustified act," Health Minister Giulia Grillo is calling for tougher sentences against "these hateful crimes committed by heartless criminals." Member of parliament Michela Brambilla, who previously proposed a law that would ban the use of poisoned bait, likewise calls for harsher penalties for those "who mistreat and kill those who do not even have a voice." Meanwhile, #Kaos was trending among Italian tweeters. (This gang put a big bounty on a dog's head.)
Summary: A German Shepherd named Kaos, who was credited with finding survivors after two major earthquakes in Italy, died from poisoning, prompting outrage and calls for tougher sentences for animal abusers.
Story: – Today is the 35th anniversary of the day Mark David Chapman killed John Lennon outside the singer's New York City apartment building. A look around at the coverage: A photographer took the only image of Chapman and Lennon together—just five hours before Chapman killed Lennon. He recounts the day to NJ.com. "Something in the back of my mind was going, 'Do it, do it, do it," Chapman recalled a few years after the killing. CNN explores what drove him. Read Jimmy Breslin's Daily News column written on deadline that night in 1980, reprinted at the Daily Beast. What's it like to live in New York and look just like John Lennon? The New Republic interviews Charles Gariepy and learns it's not like bearing a resemblance to Elvis. "You have to be much more chill about it." The AP is re-running its original coverage of the shooting here, including Yoko Ono's plea to police: "Tell me it isn't true." Cox Media rounds up other original stories here. Lennon had released Double Fantasy just weeks before his death, and Ultimate Classic Rock takes a look at how it was seen as a "potentially exciting, yet still determinedly tentative, step back toward music" for him. Many Americans learned of his death during Monday Night Football. The International Business Times rounds up that and other factoids about the night. "All those great songs are still with us," writes Chris Shields at the St. Cloud Times. "Whether you grew up with them, were raised on them as I was, or whether you discover them on your own, the music remains. It doesn't matter if you are 15 or 50, John Lennon's legacy, his voice, his spirit is here with us whenever we need it."
Summary: Mark David Chapman killed John Lennon outside Lennon's New York City apartment building 35 years ago, with a photographer capturing the only image of the two together before the murder, and Chapman recalling a voice in his head urging him to commit the act.
Story: – Gold-medal sprinter Gil Roberts nearly kissed away his career. But an arbitrator cleared the champ of charges he ingested a banned substance, conceding the drug got into his system exactly as Roberts says it did—through smooching with his girlfriend, reports Sports Illustrated. Roberts, 28, who won the 4x400-meter relay with Team USA at the 2016 Rio Games, was suspended in May after testing positive for probenecid. The runner says the drug got into his system through his girlfriend, who was treating a sinus infection and whom he "frequently and passionately" kissed. Roberts' paramour bought the drug during a trip to India and was still taking it when she returned to the US. "He had no idea that kissing his girlfriend could lead to his ingesting a prohibited substance," the independent arbitrator writes in a June 20 report released Friday, per the BBC. "When he kissed her he did not remember the taste of medicine in her mouth," he adds. The decision was expedited so Roberts could compete in the USA Track and Field Outdoor Championships in order to qualify for world championships in London next month. The arbitrator says the failed drug test for Roberts "must have been like lightning out of a clear blue sky for him to learn by kissing his girlfriend this time that he was exposing himself to a prohibited substance," adding that the runner "has met his burden of proof." The case echoes that of pole vault champ Shawn Barber, who tested positive for cocaine after visiting a female escort, USA Today notes. (After a doping finding, an Olympic wrestler turned down a silver medal.)
Summary: Gil Roberts, a gold-medal sprinter, was cleared of charges of ingesting a banned substance after an arbitrator found that the drug entered his system through kissing his girlfriend, who had purchased the substance in India and was still taking it when she returned to the US.
Story: – The prostitute who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and administering drugs in the 2013 death of a Google executive aboard his yacht has been released from custody early due to good behavior—but she might not be hanging around the US for long. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office says Alix Tichelman was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials immediately upon her release from Santa Cruz jail on March 29, reports the Santa Cruz Sentinel. Agents had filed a 24-hour hold request a month after she was sentenced in 2015 and again days before her release, reports the New York Daily News. However, jail officials refused to hold Tichelman since the law prohibits them from detaining a person for immigration reasons. Instead, ICE agents arrived to take Tichelman into custody at her release around 5am. ICE officials haven't commented—a rep tells the Sentinel that a press release is in the works—but the director of the Santa Cruz County Immigration Project says "anyone with a felony is put in a very special category, and there's virtually no way of preventing their deportation." Tichelman was born in Canada but spent much of her childhood in Georgia, reports KSBW. She was living in California at the time of her arrest.
Summary: A Canadian prostitute who was released from custody early due to good behavior in the 2013 death of a Google executive on his yacht has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents for possible deportation, despite a law prohibiting jail officials from holding individuals for immigration reasons.
Story: – The bond a baby forges with his or her parents may have big implications for the child's mental health as a teenager, a study finds. Researchers evaluated children's behavior starting at the age of four months, watching how they reacted to seeing their mothers after a period apart, PsychCentral reports. Those who happily greeted their parents before venturing off to explore were deemed to have secure bonds; those who stayed away or seemed upset were seen as having insecure bonds. The scientists also studied whether the children were "behaviorally inhibited": Did they retreat when confronted with new people or things? Many years later, 165 of those children, as well as their parents, discussed the now-teenage subjects' experiences with anxiety, as the researchers report in Child Development. The team found that the kids who had been behaviorally inhibited and had had insecure bonds with their parents showed higher levels of anxiety as teens; the link was particularly pronounced among boys. "The most important message from this study is that competent, responsive parents who form a secure relationship with their young children can be an extremely important protective factor in their child’s development," a researcher tells the University of Waterloo's news service. (Another interesting study finds that for moms, the smell of their newborns is like a drug.)
Summary: According to a study, babies who form a secure bond with their parents are less likely to experience anxiety as teenagers, with the strongest link found among boys.
Story: – The least suspenseful part of the New York Republican primary is history: Donald Trump has won his home state over Ted Cruz and John Kasich in a rout, with the race called by CNN and AP as soon as polls closed at 9pm Eastern. Now the big question: How many of the state's 95 delegates up for grabs will he be able to win by night's end? Getting all or most would keep him in the running to secure the magic number of 1,237 ahead of the GOP convention. Delegates are doled out via congressional districts, and for a clean sweep, Trump would have to win 50% of the vote in each district. Early overall returns suggested he could well pull it off: He had 63% of the vote, followed by Kasich at 23% and Cruz at 14%. NBC and Fox are projecting a second-place finish for Kasich. In a speech to supporters, Trump thanked New Yorkers, "the people who know me best," for the landslide win. "We don't have much of a race anymore," he said of the overall GOP contest. He also credited his "evolving" campaign team, a nod to a recent high-level shakeup amid what the Washington Post calls "staff turmoil" and worries that his team wasn't organized enough about securing delegates. Next up: Contests in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut, and Rhode Island next week. (On the Democratic side Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton won her home state, too.)
Summary: Donald Trump has won the New York Republican primary with a landslide victory, securing 63% of the vote, and is poised to win a majority of the state's 95 delegates, which could bring him closer to the magic number of 1,237 needed to secure the Republican nomination.
Story: – Amid withering criticism of his failing to more directly address domestic abuse issues at a news conference earlier this week, suspended Ohio State coach Urban Meyer issued an apology Friday to the ex-wife of a former assistant coach who was suspected of abusing her. Meyer, who is serving a three-game suspension for his handling of abuse allegations and other misdeeds from former receivers coach Zach Smith, was criticized because he declined to address Courtney Smith during a question-and-answer session with reporters on Wednesday night, reports the AP. "Let me say here and now what I should have said on Wednesday: I sincerely apologize to Courtney Smith and her children for what they have gone through," he tweeted. "My words and demeanor on Wednesday did not show how seriously I take relationship violence." "This has been a real learning experience for me. I fully intend to use my voice more effectively to be a part of the solution." An investigative report released soon after Meyer answered questions about his suspension Wednesday night showed that he tolerated bad behavior for years from Zach Smith, who was arrested after he allegedly abused Courtney Smith in 2009 while working as a graduate assistant under Meyer at Florida. In 2015 Courtney Smith said her husband put his hands around her neck and shoved her against a wall. He wasn't charged in either case. Meyer eventually acknowledged he was aware of the 2015 allegations but didn't fire Zach Smith until July 24 after Courtney Smith was granted a domestic protection order to protect her from her ex-husband. (A female ESPN host had a strong reaction to Meyer's presser.)
Summary: Urban Meyer apologized to Courtney Smith and her children for his handling of her abuse allegations, acknowledging that his words and demeanor on Wednesday did not show how seriously he takes relationship violence, and vowed to use his voice more effectively to be part of the solution.
Story: – The usual suspects descended on the Sunday talk shows today with their eyes firmly fixated on Wednesday's presidential debate, when President Obama and Mitt Romney go mano a mano for the first time. Chris Christie, appearing on no fewer than three shows, minced no words in building up expectations for Romney, saying the debate would create a "barn burner:" “This whole race is going to be turned upside down come Thursday morning,” he said, adding that even "folks like Charles Krauthammer will be happy." Paul Ryan was more measured, notes Politico, saying, "I don't think one event is going to make or break this campaign." Elsewhere on the great debate debate on your Sunday dial, as per Politico: More from Ryan: The debate will highlight "who is Mitt Romney, what kind of president will he be, and what choice do I have. Then the country understands the choice they have to make." David Plouffe on Romney: “He’s prepared more than any candidate, certainly in recent memory. So we believe Gov. Romney. He’s been a good debater in the past. He’s got all these clever zingers and lines in his pocket, so we understand he’ll probably have a good night on Wednesday night.” Plouffe on Christie's 'barn burner' prediction: "They've set it—they expect to come out of this with the race changed. They've set the bar high." Ryan on his own debate: Joe Biden is "fast on the cuff. He's a witty guy. He knows who he is and he's been doing this for 40 years. So you're not going to rattle Joe Biden." John McCain: "Sometimes we expect a major breakthrough, but that doesn't happen very often." But Romney's only "behind because Americans probably feel better than they did" in a "glimmer of hope." Nevertheless, people will watch: "I think you're going to see more viewers at this first debate than you have in history," McCain added.
Summary: The Sunday talk shows featured discussions about the upcoming presidential debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, with some guests predicting a "barn burner" and others emphasizing the importance of the debate in shaping the campaign narrative.
Story: – Carol Bartz is not beating around the bushes when it comes to her dismissal from Yahoo. “These people fucked me over,” she told Fortune Tuesday, in her first interview since the ouster. Bartz says that when she made a scheduled call to Chairman Roy Bostock, he began reading her a lawyer-approved statement. “I said, ‘Roy, I think that’s a script. Why don’t you have the balls to tell me yourself?” But Bostock soldiered on. When he was done, Bartz simply replied, “It got it. I got it. I thought you were classier.” Nonetheless, Bartz intends to stay on Yahoo’s board, out of loyalty to its employees, and anyway, "I have way too many purple clothes." Bartz’s bluntness about her firing is rare from top executives, the New York Times notes. Some experts expect such honesty to become a trend, as executives try to protect their personal brand more than their ex-company’s brand. “The younger generation appreciates this honesty,” one professor says. “You’re authentic, and you’re vulnerable.”
Summary: Carol Bartz was fired from Yahoo and is openly critical of the company's chairman, Roy Bostock, for reading her a scripted statement instead of being direct, but she intends to stay on the company's board out of loyalty to employees and because she has too many purple clothes.
Story: – Someone has stolen a plaque commemorating the man who tried to blow up Adolf Hitler from its spot of honor at Hitler's infamous Wolf's Lair in Poland, AFP reports. According to the AP, a guide at what is now a popular tourist attraction noticed the plaque was missing last Sunday, and police announce its theft yesterday. A number of German tourists were in the area when the 24-inch-by-24-inch plaque was last seen, and Polish police are hoping German authorities will help them find out if those tourists have any information about the theft, AFP reports. The plaque was unveiled in 2004 to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Col. Claus von Stauffenberg's failed attempt to assassinate Hitler with a briefcase bomb. The attempt killed three officers and a stenographer but failed to take out Hitler, and von Stauffenberg and three others were executed. Wolf's Lair was the largest of Hitler's 10 command bases during WWII. Seventy years later, approximately 200,000 tourists visit the overgrown ruins of its 200 bunkers and barracks every year.
Summary: A plaque commemorating Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler with a bomb was stolen from its location at Hitler's Wolfs Lair in Poland, with Polish authorities hoping German tourists may have information about the theft.
Story: – Food: It seems relatively inoffensive, but it has a history of names that are racist, shocking, or just plain gross. Salon recalls the 10 worst names in food history: Spotted Dick: An English pudding filled with currants (hence the “spotted”). Why “dick”? Wikipedia notes it may be some sort of contraction for the word “pudding” or “dough.” Still. Welsh Rarebit: Cheese, beer, and bread: What’s not to like? Just the name, which was meant to imply this was the poor Welsh man’s substitute for rabbit, already a poor man’s meat. Chicken Poo House: Yes, that is the literal translation for Korean dish daak ddong jib. Sometimes also translated as the equally yummy-sounding “chicken anus.” What it actually is: chicken gizzards. Nun’s Farts: One theory for how the French came up with this name: One nun farted in a kitchen; another laughed and dropped her cream-puff dough into hot oil. Sounds tasty, but can you imagine ordering this at a restaurant? Priest Stranglers: The literal translation of strozzapreti, sometimes even called strangolapreti, a gnocchi-type pasta said to have once, yes, choked a gluttonous priest. For the complete list, click here.
Summary: The article highlights 10 foods with offensive or unusual names, including Spotted Dick, Welsh Rarebit, Chicken Poo House, Nun's Farts, and Priest Stranglers, with origins ranging from racist to mundane to absurd.
Story: – Hillary Clinton is clinging to a razor-thin lead over Bernie Sanders in Kentucky's Democratic primary and lost to him by a solid 6 points in the Oregon primary on Tuesday, CNN reports. In Kentucky, where Clinton is considered the favorite, she has 212,549 votes (46.8%) to Sanders' 210,626 (46.3%) with 99% of precincts reporting. "I do believe ... that based on what we are seeing coming in, that Kentucky will remain in a win column for the Clintons," says Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. "Hillary Clinton will be the unofficial winner." Over the last few days, Clinton invested time and money in the bluegrass state in an attempt to blunt Sanders' recent surge of primary victories and strengthen her position in the general election, assuming her substantial delegate-lead holds. She took an expected loss in Oregon's primary, which was decided by a mostly white, liberal voting base that favors Sanders. With 60% reporting, Sanders is ahead there with 219,602 votes (53%) to Clinton's 94,443 (47%)—enough for the AP to call it in his favor. Oregon is also hosting a Tuesday GOP primary that Donald Trump won handily. The New York mogul is ahead by 174,793 votes (66.6%) to John Kasich's 44,666 (17%) and Ted Cruz's 42,837 (16.3%) with 60% reporting. Oregon has 28 Republican delegates and 61 Democratic delegates up for grabs. Like all Democratic primaries, Oregon and Kentucky will divvy up delegates proportionally, so Sanders won't make much of a dent in Clinton's delegate-lead, Five Thirty-Eight notes. Follow the latest results at the New York Times.
Summary: Hillary Clinton is maintaining a slim lead over Bernie Sanders in the Kentucky Democratic primary with 46.8% of the vote to his 46.3%, while Sanders won the Oregon primary by a wider margin of 53% to 47%.
Story: – A French-Canadian comedian found a child singer with a genetic disease who's performed for Celine Dion and Pope Benedict to be the perfect butt of his jokes—and now the Quebec Human Rights Tribunal is making the funnyman pay some not-so-funny money to both the singer, now 19, and his mother, Vice News reports. Mike Ward has to pay $35,000 ($25,000 in moral damages, $10,000 in punitive damages) to Jeremy Gabriel—who Ward has referred to as "Petit Jeremy"—for a series of jokes about Gabriel, who suffers from Treacher Collins syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes facial deformities and hearing issues, at shows between 2010 and 2013, per the Toronto Star. The tribunal, which found the remarks to be discriminatory, also awarded Gabriel's mom $7,000. The jokes revolved around Gabriel's visit with the pope in 2006, which Ward first addressed in his 2010 act. In that set, the comedian noted he had initially been happy for Gabriel's meeting with the pontiff, since he thought Gabriel was terminally ill, the CBC notes—"but now, five years later, and he's still not dead! Me, I defended him, like an idiot, and he won't die!" is how he wrapped his piece up, adding Gabriel was "ugly," not dying. Gabriel says his self-esteem plunged and it led to him being bullied; he says he even tried to commit suicide. Some don't agree with the tribunal's decision, noting it sets a sticky precedent for free speech. "This is terrifying. A comedian forced to pay someone who got offended by his joke," a fellow comedian who has dwarfism tweeted. Ward, who says the bullying against Gabriel likely started before his joke, doesn't appear to be giving up the fight. "Even Rocky lost the first one, we're gonna appeal," Ward posted on Facebook early Thursday, with Vice noting he also joked around about the tribunal's decision. A "disappointed" Gabriel tells the CBC, "it shows Mike Ward didn't understand the reason for the complaint and the decision." (A deaf woman is suing Taco Bell over how difficult it was to order food.)
Summary: A Quebec human rights tribunal ordered comedian Mike Ward to pay $35,000 in damages to a 19-year-old man with Treacher Collins syndrome and his mother after Ward made jokes about the man's genetic disorder in his comedy shows between 2010 and 2013.
Story: – President Trump took to Twitter early Thursday to push back against the criticism of his controversial remarks about the violence in Charlottesville. He took particular issue with GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham. "Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists and people like Ms. Heyer," he tweeted, referring to Heather Heyer, the woman killed during the protests. He called that a "disgusting lie" and said voters in Graham's home state of South Carolina "will remember!" He also accused the media in general of distorting his remarks. "The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is," he wrote. "They totally misrepresent what I say about hate, bigotry etc. Shame!" In his Tuesday remarks—here is the full transcript—Trump insisted that "alt-left" counter-protesters shared in the blame for the weekend's violence, and Graham has been one of many public officials to criticize the president over that. "Trump took a step backward by again suggesting there is moral equivalency between the white supremacist neo-Nazis and KKK members who attended the Charlottesville rally and people like Ms. Heyer," Graham said in a statement, per CNN. "I, along with many others, do not endorse this moral equivalency."
Summary: President Trump lashed out at Senator Lindsey Graham on Twitter for criticizing his remarks on the violence in Charlottesville, denying that he equated white supremacists and counter-protesters and accusing the media of distorting his words.
Story: – Seattle's KOMO has quite the scoop: The first interviews with one of America's most prolific serial killers since he was imprisoned a decade ago. It's pretty grim stuff. Green River Killer Gary Ridgway pleaded guilty to killing 48 women (a 49th victim was IDed in 2011), but he tells KOMO's Charlie Harger the true number could be closer to 80. The story of how the five months of interviews came to be is pretty fascinating: Harger met an Air Force criminal investigator named Rob Fitzgerald, who has dedicated his weekends for much of the past five years to searching for remains of Ridgway's female victims—largely prostitutes, runaways, and drug addicts. And it turns out he has an unlikely assistant in his quest: Ridgway. The two speak as many as four times a week, with Ridgway calling from the Walla Walla prison in which he's spending the rest of his life, providing details on possible "dump sites." Harger, shocked to hear Ridgway was talking, managed to get to him as well. Ridgway reiterated to Harger that his goal is to help: He says at least 20 bodies are still out there, and he wants to help police find them. Harger's not so sure about that, though; he notes that for all of Ridgway's assistance, Fitzgerald has yet to find any remains (Ridgway apparently attributes that to decomposition or animals). Harger theorizes that Ridgway may just be attempting to "up his count," and notes that he complained that Ted Bundy is a household name, and he isn't. Click for more from the interviews, in which Ridgway, without emotion, discusses a victim’s head falling off her decomposing body.
Summary: Gary Ridgway, the Green River Killer, has confessed to killing 80 women, including 48 confirmed victims, and has been providing details on possible dump sites to an Air Force criminal investigator, despite his previous guilty plea for 48 murders.
Story: – Elon Musk reportedly went on a Twitter rant Sunday against a key player in the recent rescue of 12 boys and their soccer coach from a cave in Thailand. According to Vox.com, the billionaire investor called British cave diver Vernon Unsworth "pedo guy" as part of a series of tweets that appeared to be a retaliation for Unsworth's assertion in an interview that Musk's attempt to contribute to the rescue was just empty posturing. Musk's ideas had “absolutely no chance” of working, said Unsworth, who lives in Thailand and has extensively explored the Tham Luang cave system where the 13 people were trapped for weeks. “He can stick his submarine where it hurts,” Unsworth continued. In addition to directing his teams at SpaceX to engineer a mini submarine to help pull out the kids, Musk reportedly proposed an underwater air tunnel that could be used in the rescue. Musk went to Thailand, but neither method was used. "Never saw this British expat guy," Musk tweeted Sunday, per Business Insider, before demanding he show video that Musk believed would prove him right. Minutes after the initial post, Musk's tone took a turn. "You know what, don’t bother showing the video. We will make one of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo," he wrote. "Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it." Musk offered no evidence to back up his assertion that Unsworth is a pedophile, but bet one doubtful follower "a signed dollar it’s true." The Twitter posts appear to have since been deleted.
Summary: Elon Musk launched a Twitter rant against British cave diver Vernon Unsworth, calling him "pedo guy" and making unsubstantiated claims of sexual misconduct, after Unsworth criticized Musk's attempts to contribute to the rescue of the Thai cave boys.
Story: – Best line in a police report in a while: "Agosto mentioned he regretted applying cologne on his person prior to leaving his house." It comes via police in Lebanon, Ore., in reference to Charles Agosto, reports KPTV. Cops say the 35-year-old refused to stop after a traffic violation and led them on a high-speed chase early Sunday. He actually got away, at least at first. But after officers spotted his car parked in a driveway, they began searching the neighborhood with dogs. While they couldn't see Agosto in the darkness, they could smell him thanks to his heavy cologne, reports the Albany Democrat-Herald. Agosto was hunkered down in shrubbery, and the search took only a few minutes. He is charged with attempting to elude a police officer, reckless driving, and criminal trespassing.
Summary: Charles Agosto was found hiding in shrubbery after a high-speed chase and traffic violation, thanks to the strong scent of his cologne that could be detected by police dogs despite the darkness.
Story: – Amid a buildup to the centennial of the Titanic's sinking that went on and on, the actual event arrived last night, with ceremonies from Belfast to the North Atlantic marking the disaster that claimed nearly 1,500 lives. The MS Balmoral, on a cruise retracing the doomed liner's first and final voyage, observed a moment of silence at the site of the sinking with passengers lining the decks, reports the AP. Three wreaths were tossed into the waters. "It was just so eerily quiet," says the great-niece of one of the ship's victims. "And then you look down over the side of the ship and you realize that every man and woman who was not fortunate enough to get into a lifeboat had to make that decision of when to jump or to stay with the ship, until the lights went out." Says another passenger aboard the Balmoral, "You still get a chill just looking at that water, imagining you have to go into it." In Belfast, where the Titanic was built, a plague with the names of the victims was unveiled in the Titanic Memorial Garden, notes the BBC. Titanic hit an iceberg some 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland at 11:40pm on April 14, 1912, and sank a scant three hours later.
Summary: Passengers on a cruise ship reenacting the Titanic's final voyage observed a moment of silence at the site of the sinking and tossed wreaths into the ocean, while in Belfast, a plague with the names of the victims was unveiled in a memorial garden to mark the 100th anniversary of the disaster.
Story: – Following up its latest Captain America flick can't have been easy, but Marvel Studios has apparently aced the task. With a 90% approval rating from both critics and audiences on Rotten Tomatoes, Doctor Strange is a superhero movie almost universally adored. Here's what critics are saying: Sara Stewart had "a heck of a lot more fun than [she's] had at a Marvel movie lately," she writes at the New York Post. "With a mischievous, metaphysical flourish, Doctor Strange administers some much-needed CPR to the flagging superhero genre" and is one of only a few movies that truly delivers on its promise of a 3D spectacle. Benedict Cumberbatch "makes a funny, dashing addition to the Marvel pantheon," and Tilda Swinton is also "excellent." The film opens with a "spectacular, slow-motion car accident," but "it's nothing compared to the ocular extravaganza that follows," writes Michael O'Sullivan at the Washington Post. Viewers are in for "a fun and trippy excursion to a place where Marvel rarely seems to go: that is, to the retinal roots of the comics," he writes. Beware of motion sickness, though: the special effects are "quite literally, out of this world." "Doctor Strange creates its own world. And it's a badass beauty," writes Peter Travers at Rolling Stone, though he saves most of his praise for Cumberbatch. "What Robert Downey Jr. is to Iron Man ... that's what Benedict Cumberbatch is to Doctor Strange. By that I mean, he's everything." See the flick in 3D IMAX, he adds. "You're in for the hallucinatory headtrip of the year." In some ways, Doctor Strange is generic Marvel, yet refreshingly, the special effects "serve beauty and meaning rather than the grimly tedious destruction," Manohla Dargis writes at the New York Times. In fact, the film is "so visually transfixing, so beautiful and nimble that you may even briefly forget the brand," she writes. Plus "the space-and-time warping and mirrored realities … are a blast."
Summary: Doctor Strange has received widespread critical acclaim with a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics praising its unique visuals, mischievous tone, and the performances of Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton.
Story: – In what the FBI and local police are treating as a hate crime, two California mosques in the same city were vandalized with pro-Christian graffiti over the weekend. On Sunday morning, "Jesus Is the Way" was found painted on the front of one mosque in Hawthorne, and the word "Jesus" was on the fence of another, where police found a grenade that turned out to be fake, the Los Angeles Times reports. Police in Hawthorne, which is about an hour away from San Bernardino, say they've been communicating more closely with Islamic centers since the massacre and are working with the FBI and the LA County Sheriff's Department on this investigation, reports CNN. Last week, a Coachella mosque was set on fire and a pig's head was dumped in front of a Philadelphia mosque amid what Council on American-Islamic Relations spokesman Ibrahim Hooper tells the New York Times was an "unprecedented spike in anti-Muslim incidents" after the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. He blames the surge on heated rhetoric from Donald Trump and others. "Right after 9/11, anti-Muslim hate was on the fringes of society, and now it has been brought right into the mainstream," Hooper says. "It's almost acceptable now to hate Islam and Muslims, and now we see the results." (A Texas group posted the addresses of Muslims and people it labeled "Muslim sympathizers.")
Summary: Two California mosques were vandalized with pro-Christian graffiti over the weekend, including the phrase "Jesus Is the Way" on one mosque and the word "Jesus" on the fence of another, where a fake grenade was found.
Story: – Next month, a Spanish court will hear arguments in a most unusual case: A woman who claims to own the sun has sued eBay for blocking her extraterrestrial real estate sales. Though it sounds a little nuts, a court in Madrid has ruled that 54-year-old Maria Angeles Duran has the right to have her case heard, reports the International Business Times. The court won't rule on the larger issue of whether Duran's claim of ownership is legit, but on the narrower one of whether she violated eBay's seller agreement. She had been selling parcels of about 11 square feet for about $1 each and had racked up 600 orders before eBay shut her down. Because nothing tangible was sold, it feared a scam. Duran says she was never able to collect her money and is suing for about $11,000 in damages, reports the Consumerist. “I am not a stupid person and I know the law,” Duran has said of her solar real estate gambit. She's basing her claim on a loophole in the UN's Outer Space Treaty that says no nation can stake ownership to a heavenly body but makes no mention of individuals—borrowing the strategy used by this entrepreneur's claim on the moon. Duran, as you might imagine, is an eclectic character, observes the Washington Post. "She’s studied nursing and law, dreamt up her own religion, and penned a kinky romance novel," writes Caitlin Dewey. The story notes that Duran is framing her sun fight as a statement against the corporate world and promises that any profits will go to charity. For those who want in, Duran is still selling parcels on her own website. (Or check out eBay's haunted dolls.)
Summary: A Spanish woman, Maria Angeles Duran, is suing eBay for blocking her sales of extraterrestrial real estate, claiming ownership of the sun based on a loophole in the UN's Outer Space Treaty, despite eBay's fear of a potential scam.
Story: – Dead puffins are washing up on the shores of an island in the Bering Sea at an alarming rate, National Geographic reports. "In 10 years of monitoring, we've only seen six puffins wash in—total," a professor who coordinates a West Coast volunteer bird-monitoring network says. In just shy of three weeks, they've seen 250. Scientists believe the actual number of dead puffins is much higher, to the point that half the puffin population in the North Pacific may be dead. The cause is no great mystery: The birds are simply starving to death. And scientists are concerned what that means for other animal populations in the Bering Sea, which provides a good chunk of North America's seafood, from crab to salmon to the pollock found in fish sticks. The culprit appears to be water temperatures that were "off-the-charts warm" this year, according to NOAA ecologist Nata Mantua. Even the normally chill water found at the bottom of the Bering Sea was 6 degrees Celsius above normal. The warm water not only killed off the fatty zooplankton fish rely on for food, but almost all zoo plankton; that hurt fish populations, which meant less food for mammals and birds. In August, the Portland Press Herald reported on the woes plaguing the largest puffin colony in the Gulf of Maine. On Machias Seal Island, 60% of puffin nests that hold eggs produce viable chicks who ultimately enter the sea; this year it was 12%, and those who didn't starve to death were notably small. Scientists theorize a warming gulf impacted the food supply there, too. (There's other drama happening at Machias Seal Island.)
Summary: An alarming number of dead puffins are washing up on the shores of an island in the Bering Sea, with over 250 found in just three weeks, leading scientists to believe that half of the puffin population in the North Pacific may have died due to starvation caused by unusually warm water temperatures that killed off the birds' food supply.
Story: – The Miss Liberty America pageant may include a marksmanship category, have a goal of "restoring Liberty to the United States," and judge contestants based on their knowledge of the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence ... but don't call it a Tea Party beauty pageant. That's what Tim Murphy did last week in Mother Jones, and the founder was quick to correct him. "We don't want to be associated with that," says Alicia Hayes-Roberts. "We're a corporation, we are a for-profit operation, and I can't have that." Hayes-Roberts happens to be sister to Rutherford B. Hayes (no relation to our 19th president), a 2012 presidential candidate who appears to be "something of a Tea Partier" himself, Murphy notes: He wants to "weed out 'socialists, communists, and marxists,' ... institute a 10% flat tax ... return to the gold standard," and "abolish the IRS," among other things. Even so, his sister insists the pageant (for which her bro is the chief financial officer) is not on the "fringe"—it's "associated with what the meat of America is."
Summary: The Miss Liberty America pageant, which includes a marksmanship category and judges contestants on their knowledge of the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence, is not a Tea Party beauty pageant despite the founder's relation to a 2012 presidential candidate who holds conservative views.
Story: – Scientists have unraveled the genome of the tsetse fly after a 10-year effort, and the development could save Africa from the devastating effects of the fatal infection it carries known as sleeping sickness, reports LiveScience. While the disease—one that drives its victims crazy in rabies-like fashion and is fatal without treatment—hits about 20,000 a year, it tends to surge in epidemics and thus endangers an estimated 70 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, reports National Geographic. A form of it also attacks livestock. The decoding of the genome gives scientists the potential to identify and attack vulnerabilities of the insect, including a particularly unusual one. “Tsetse biology is just freaky,” an insect neurobiologist at Rockefeller University tells the New York Times. “This is an insect that breastfeeds its children.” Scientists found the particular gene that regulates milk production, and if they can disable it through chemicals, the tsetse larvae will starve. Another option is to manipulate genes so the fly rejects the parasites that cause sleeping sickness in the first place. One expert at Johns Hopkins calls the paper "really kind of a landmark in the molecular genetics of neglected tropical diseases." (Click for four more of the week's fascinating discoveries.)
Summary: Scientists have decoded the genome of the tsetse fly after a 10-year effort, which could lead to the development of new treatments for the fatal sleeping sickness it carries, including disrupting the gene that regulates milk production or manipulating genes to make the fly reject the parasites that cause the disease.
Story: – Democrats think they've found the issue that will carry them to victory in 2014: the minimum wage. Polls show broad support among both Republican and Democratic voters for hiking the $7.25 federal rate, the New York Times reports, but congressional Republicans have come out against it. "It puts Republicans on the wrong side of an important value issue," says one senior Obama adviser. Democrats think the issue will boost turnout among crucial minority and young voters, who often skip midterms. To that end, Democrats will push minimum wage ballot initiatives in challenging states like Arkansas, Alaska, and South Dakota, even though the Democratic incumbents in some of those states aren't currently backing wage hikes. The strategy comes as lawmakers prepare for what Politico is calling a "go small" year. It's predicting that what's oft been derided as a do-nothing Congress will do even less, as Republicans use ObamaCare's rocky debut to hammer any attempts to expand government.
Summary: Democrats are focusing on the minimum wage as a key issue for the 2014 midterm elections, hoping to boost turnout among crucial demographics by pushing for ballot initiatives in challenging states despite opposition from congressional Republicans.
Story: – Writer and director John Ridley takes audiences back to 1966 and '67, before Jimi Hendrix was a rock god, in Jimi: All Is by My Side. The new flick starring Outkast's Andre 3000, also known as Andre Benjamin, has been called "fascinating," yet also downright weird. Here's what critics are saying: Simply put, Andre 3000 "gets it right," writes Steven Rea at the Philadelphia Inquirer. He "captures Hendrix's nodding swagger, his effortless cool, and most important, his voice—going beyond mimicry into some other, spookier realm." Together, the cast and Ridley "make you appreciate" Hendrix's "impossibly short, impossibly brilliant" life. Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle, however, was less thrilled. "Think of a famous Hendrix song. For that matter, think of an obscure Hendrix song. Whatever you're thinking of, it's not in the movie," he writes. "That's a little like making a film about Henry Ford without ever showing a car." The lack of music is "largely the result of the tangled condition of the Hendrix musical estate," writes Andrew O'Hehir at Salon. "But the damn thing is, Ridley very nearly makes this insuperable obstacle work to his benefit." The film is a "fascinating" and "deeply peculiar portrait of one of the 20th century's most enigmatic musical talents" that "resembles no other pop-music biopic you've ever seen." Kenneth Turan at the Los Angeles Times agrees the absence of Hendrix's best-known tunes "doesn't hurt this moody, mesmerizing film one bit" thanks to Andre 3000's "extraordinary performance." He "is able to almost instinctively create a sense of what it must have felt like to be Hendrix." And Ridley shows, like Hendrix, that he can think outside the box.
Summary:  All Is by My Side" tells the story of Jimi Hendrix's life before he became a rock god, with Andre 3000 starring as the legendary musician. Despite the lack of Hendrix's most famous songs, critics praise the film for its "fascinating" and "deeply peculiar" portrayal of Hendrix's life, with Andre 3000's "extraordinary performance" bringing the musician to life in a way that feels both authentic and innovative.
Story: – The search for a youth soccer team lost for three days in a cave in Thailand resumed Tuesday with a message of hope. "We are still optimistic they are all alive," Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwon said, adding, "even though they may not have anything to eat, they should have water to drink." It was a message fueled by the discovery of fresh handprints and footprints inside the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex, which the 25-year-old team coach and 12 boys aged 11 to 16 are believed to have entered Saturday through a 50-foot-long tunnel crossed by a stream. With heavy rains, that stream has now become a wall of water, partially flooding caves and passageways, some of which extend nearly 4 miles underground in Chiang Rai province, per the BBC. "Our concern is about the rain. The water inside the cave keeps rising," deputy governor Passakorn Bunyalak tells the New York Times, though officials are pumping water out. Still, officials believe the team remains alive—though perhaps with depleted oxygen—inside the cave's main chamber. "The kids are athletes, and they have skills," says Bunyalak. "They will try to survive by continuing to move." Rescuers in scuba gear can be seen mingling with medical teams at the cave entrance, while outside, family members pray around makeshift shrines as they wait for news, and more water pumps. "When I saw his bike parked inside parked at the cave, my tears were just dropping. I was desperate to find my son," an impatient father tells CNN. "We need a miracle, I want him back."
Summary: A search for a lost youth soccer team in a Thai cave resumed with renewed hope after fresh handprints and footprints were discovered, despite heavy rains causing the stream inside the cave to become a wall of water, partially flooding the caves and passageways.
Story: – It's known that a runner's high isn't actually the result of endorphins, which are too large to cross the blood-brain barrier, but scientists have long sought the elusive cause of the much-talked-about sense of euphoria and calm that can accompany the end of a workout. Now researchers are reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that endocannabinoids—chemicals that the New York Times describes as, "essentially, internally produced marijuana"—are behind the subtly intoxicating effects of exercise. To test this, researchers conditioned mice to run on a treadmill, then let one group run for five hours and forced the second to be inactive. All mice were then watched for signs of anxiety (i.e. preference for darkness, pain intolerance, etc.). Then, in a second experiment that looked nearly identical, the researchers added endocannabinoid and endorphin antagonists to block their effects. This time the mice who ran did not exhibit the reduced anxiety associated with a runner's high, reports CBS Atlanta. The results can't be directly translated to humans, but the fact that such tiny animals have to run three miles a day to produce a runner's high may suggest that humans have evolved to be in motion. "The subtle upshot of the new study may be that we should run," writes Gretchen Reynolds in the Times. "And if we don’t feel a high, perhaps try running more, until eventually a gentle euphoria may settle in and we can turn to our running companion and say, 'Ah, my endocannabinoids are kicking in at last!'" (Endocannabinoids are implicated in over-eating, too.)
Summary: Researchers have discovered that endocannabinoids, rather than endorphins, are the cause of the euphoric and calming sensation experienced after exercise, known as a "runner's high."
Story: – Parks and Recreation put its last show in the books last night, and while we'll try to limit the big spoilers, anyone planning to catch up with Leslie Knope later should stop reading now. Generally speaking, critics were left feeling warm and fuzzy by the finale from Amy Poehler and crew, and the show's legacy in general: The Office comparison: It's great Parks went out after seven seasons, "pretty close to the top of its game," writes Margaret Lyons at Vulture. If only The Office (remember that Parks began as a kind of clone of that show) had done the same. Poehler's sitcom avoided the lows to which The Office sometimes sank. "Parks might have had some narrative flabbiness in there over its run, but this last arc has been strong and, maybe more important, incredibly true to the show's best essential natures: smart and silly and gleeful." 'Audacious': "Almost aggressively devoid of broad humor, the super-sweet finale may have been the most audacious creative direction a series could’ve taken," writes Kevin Fallon at the Daily Beast. "There were no 'events'—a long-built-up-to wedding, for example—or wild, long-teased revelations—like how a guy met his kids’ mother. ... Instead, we got an hour that simply let us know, with excessive positivity, that everyone was going to be OK." As for Poehler and her memorable character: "genius." But: Parks "isn’t such a sweet show because it lives in a vacuum where nastiness, selfishness, and stupidity don’t exist, as they more or less didn’t in the finale," writes Willa Paskin at Slate. "It’s such a sweet show because it exists exactly in the midst of such things and its characters try to rise above the muck and their own natures anyway, even when they don’t succeed. The finale had no hint of that muck. Luckily, there are 123 other episodes of this great series to balance it out." Never again: Sadly, we won't see a show like Parks again because its model—low-rated but critically acclaimed—is "essentially extinct," writes Emily Yahr at the Washington Post. Networks wouldn't let a show like that survive today, even though it proves the point that "sometimes, the non-hit TV shows are the ones that resonate the most."
Summary: The Parks and Recreation series finale was well-received by critics, with many praising the show's ability to end on a positive note while avoiding the lows of other comedies.
Story: – The family of a woman shot dead as she walked along a San Francisco pier last year, allegedly by a Mexican man who had been deported five times before, is suing the city and the government agencies whose failings they say led to her death. Kate Steinle's family filed a wrongful-death lawsuit on Friday against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Bureau of Land Management, and San Francisco, which, under a "sanctuary city" policy, ignored a request to notify ICE when suspect Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez was released, NPR reports. The lawsuit, which also names former Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi, states that the city's policy of not sharing information on undocumented immigrants with federal agencies was in "direct contravention" of federal and state law, reports CNN. After Lopez-Sanchez finished a prison term for felony re-entry last year, ICE sent him to San Francisco to face an old marijuana warrant instead of deporting him, and the sheriff's office let him go when the case was dismissed, the Los Angeles Times reports. On July 1, within weeks of his release, Lopez-Sanchez is believed to have shot Steinle, 32, with a government-issued firearm that had been stolen from a BLM agent's car. "Kate's death was both foreseeable and preventable had the law enforcement agencies, officials, and/or officers involved simply followed the laws, regulations, and/or procedures which they swore to uphold," the lawsuit states. NPR notes that San Francisco has kept its controversial policy in place, though the sheriff is now allowed to share information with the feds when detained immigrants have felony convictions. (Lopez-Sanchez, who is in jail awaiting his murder trial, says the shooting was an accident.)
Summary: A wrongful death lawsuit was filed by the family of Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed by a Mexican man who had been deported five times, against the city of San Francisco and government agencies, alleging that their failure to notify immigration authorities led to her death.
Story: – The New York Times has pored over hundreds of pages of Donald Trump testimony from his many lawsuits over the last decade and found a lot of what it describes as "hyperbolic overstatements" and "outright misstatements," as well as some instances of truly obnoxious behavior—like the time he told a lawyer who wanted to take a break to pump breast milk that she was "disgusting." That happened during a 2011 hearing in a Florida real estate case, the Times reports, when lawyer Elizabeth Beck asked for a medical break to pump milk for her 3-month-old daughter, holding up the pump to make a point when the Trump team objected. "You're disgusting," Trump said, per the Times, and walked out of the room, ending proceedings for the day. Trump lawyer Alan Garten doesn't dispute the events, but he tells the Times that "disgusting" wasn't a statement on breastfeeding—it was on Beck displaying the pump. "In my 20 years of legal practice, I've never seen more bizarre behavior at a deposition," the lawyer says. "That is what led to his remark." Another Trump lawyer, Michael Cohen, has apologized for falsely claiming that "by the very definition, you can't rape your spouse." He tells CNN that the remark was made in a "moment of shock and anger" when a Daily Beast reporter brought up a decades-old allegation. The Trump campaign tells CNN that Trump "didn't know of his comments but disagrees with them" and that Cohen is a Trump corporate employee not affiliated in any way with the campaign.
Summary: In a deposition, Donald Trump made derogatory comments towards a lawyer who requested a break to pump breast milk, including calling her "disgusting," and a Trump lawyer has apologized for falsely claiming that it is impossible to rape one's spouse.
Story: – Well, so much for that "healthy" experiment: McDonald's is doing away with McWraps. The wraps, introduced in snack-size in 2006 and entree-size in 2013, were meant to "attract younger, healthier eaters," millennials, and customers who would otherwise eat at Subway, Bloomberg reports. But the wraps took a long time to make and never gained much of a fan base, and both sizes started to be phased out last summer, per a McD's spokesperson. (Last year, McWraps earned this headline from Business Insider: "How the McWrap is killing McDonald's business." And the New York Times explained that wraps took 60 seconds to assemble compared to a burger's 10 seconds.) The wraps featured more vegetables and not as many calories as some of the other items on the McDonald's menu, but "a lot of people who eat at restaurants aren’t interested in health and wellness," an analyst says. "You’ve got to give the people what they want." New CEO Steve Easterbrook has been working to simplify the McDonald's menu, especially with the rollout of all-day breakfast complicating the work in the kitchens. Other items recently cut: grilled-onion cheddar burgers, buffalo ranch McChicken sandwiches, and jalapeno McDoubles.
Summary: McDonald's is discontinuing its McWraps, which were introduced in 2006 and 2013 to appeal to health-conscious customers, but never gained popularity due to long preparation time and low demand.
Story: – It's for occasions like this that American Greetings sells "I'm sorry" cards: The greeting card maker is apologizing after customers took issue with one of its Father's Day cards. The front shows the phrase "Baby Daddy" over an image of a black couple kissing, which some interpreted as racially insensitive, per USA Today. (See an image of the card here.) American Greetings responded, pointing to the loving inside message, addressed to "a wonderful husband and father." But it acknowledged "the front page, taken out of context, can communicate an unintentional meaning that we are strongly against perpetuating." Therefore, "we have notified our store merchandisers to remove the card from the shelves and apologize for any offense we've caused." Target, however, was already working to remove the card from some 900 stores following complaints on social media. "This was the only Father's Day card that featured a black couple," Takeisha Saunders wrote in a May 31 Facebook post after seeing the card at a Target in Rockwall, Texas. "Baby daddy" is "not sweet or nice. It's a term used to describe a deadbeat or absent parent," she added. Others said the card was an example of "microagression racism," per Fox News. "We appreciate the feedback and apologize," Target says in a statement of its own. "It's never our intent to offend any of our guests with the products we sell." If your intent is to offend dad this Father's Day, though, Slate may have found the card for you.
Summary: American Greetings apologized for a Father's Day card featuring a black couple kissing, which some interpreted as racially insensitive due to the term "baby daddy" on the front, despite the loving message inside, and the card was removed from shelves after complaints on social media.
Story: – Kristen Biel was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014—and when she told her employer she would need time off for surgery and chemotherapy, she was dealt a second blow. St. James Catholic School in Torrance, Calif., declined to renew her contract to teach for the next academic year. She sued for discrimination, but last year, a federal judge dismissed the suit, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. On Monday, a federal appeals court reinstated it. The initial ruling against Biel cited the "ministerial exception" to civil rights laws, Education Week reports, concluding that she actually worked as a minister, not a teacher, and as such the school was allowed to fire her. But the appeals court ruled that the fact Biel taught her fifth-grade students religion curriculum along with the rest of their academic subjects, at a religious school, does not make her a minister, USA Today reports. Biel was hired by the Roman Catholic parish school within the Archdiocese of Los Angeles in 2013 as a substitute teacher, and was promoted to a full-time teacher a few months later. In November 2013 she received a positive evaluation from the principal, but less than six months later, when she was fired, the principal said her "classroom management" was "not strict." The principal also said "it was not fair ... to have two teachers for the children during the school year." The constitution's religious freedom guarantee gives religious organizations the right to choose their faith leaders, but the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals said in its 2-1 decision that religious organizations do not have carte blanche to disregard the Americans With Disabilities Act when it comes to employees who are not faith leaders. Biel's lawyer says she is still fighting cancer. (This teacher says she was fired for getting married.)
Summary: A teacher, Kristen Biel, was fired from her job at a Catholic school after being diagnosed with breast cancer, despite being told by her employer that she could take time off for surgery and chemotherapy.
Story: – Eric Huang says he's "good at vaccine development." The UC San Diego dermatology professor tells the university's Guardian he has even worked on a biodefense vaccine to fight anthrax, with a boost from the National Institutes of Health. Huang's latest development on the vaccine scene, however, may be of more interest to an even greater swath of people: He says a six-year study could lead to a vaccine that can fight the effects of Propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria that causes acne. "This is the first vaccine for human beauty," Huang tells NBC 7, adding he sees a "huge market" for it. Huang told Allure earlier this month that attempts to combat the skin condition have been challenging, as p. acnes is found in everyone's skin; it can sometimes even be beneficial, per a 2013 study. Teens' faces become P. acnes magnets, since the oils they produce during this hormone-charged period are what feeds the bacteria. Researchers sussed out an antibody that affects only the toxic Christie-Atkins-Munch-Petersen protein secreted by the bacteria, instead of killing off the actual bacteria, changing the course of the vaccine's development. Huang tells NBC two types of vaccines are in the works: a therapeutic one and a preventive one they plan on giving to kids before they reach adolescence. For now, though, only zit-prone rodents may have cause to celebrate: Large-scale clinical trials may still be a year or two away, per Business Insider—the vaccine has only been tested on mice and small samples of human skin biopsies, the website for Huang's lab notes. (If the vaccine tanks? There's always the catwalk.)
Summary: Professor Eric Huang is developing a vaccine to combat acne, which could be the first of its kind, by targeting the toxic protein secreted by the bacteria that causes acne, rather than killing the bacteria itself, and there are two types of vaccines in development, a therapeutic one for adults and a preventive one for children, but large-scale clinical trials are still a year or two away.
Story: – A state senator has won an upset over longtime US Senator Dianne Feinstein. On Saturday, the California Democratic Party voted overwhelmingly to endorse Kevin de León instead of the 4-term incumbent after de León, a progressive out of Los Angeles, successfully lobbied party activists, per the AP. In accepting the endorsement, de León called it a "rejection of politics as usual." He wrote in a tweet Saturday: "Earning the endorsement of so many leaders and activists of the California Democratic Party isn't just an honor and a privilege; today's vote is a clear-eyed rejection of politics as usual in Washington, DC." As CNN notes, de León won 65 percent of the vote despite arguments from Feinstein and her supporters that failing to support her would damage the Democrats internally and affect down-ballot races in November. Feinstein won over just 22 voters from a 360-member board, but her campaign manager says he's confident she'll have the support of Californians. "While 217 delegates expressed their view on Saturday, Senator Feinstein won by 2.1 million votes and earned 70% of the Democratic vote in the California Primary election, carrying every county by double digits over her opponent," Millman said in a statement referring to Feinstein's win over de León. The two Democrats will duke it out come November thanks to California's primary system, which sends the two top candidates from the primary election in terms of votes to the general election, regardless of party.
Summary: In a surprise upset, California state Senator Kevin de León won the endorsement of the California Democratic Party over longtime US Senator Dianne Feinstein, with 65% of the vote despite Feinstein's campaign manager expressing confidence in her support among Californians.
Story: – If you've concluded that a one-way ticket to Mars isn't for you, there's a tamer alternative: Send your name to Mars instead. Today is the last day to sign up to get your moniker on a "dime-sized microchip" that's being blasted into space on the Orion spacecraft, NASA reports. The first launch on Dec. 4 is technically only a test flight, but [insert your name here] will still get to take a 4.5-hour, two-orbit journey around Earth, then hurl back to terra firma at close to 20,000mph before splashing down in the Pacific. Your name will also be placed on future test flights and eventual missions to Mars. "When we set foot on the Red Planet, we'll be exploring for all of humanity," the Orion Program manager says. "Flying these names will enable people to be part of our journey." Hurry up to get a "seat" on the chip: More than 1.3 million other adventurers had already signed up as of this morning, USA Today reports. Get your boarding pass here before midnight EDT—though NASA notes "the public will have an opportunity to keep submitting names beyond Oct. 31 to be included on future test flights." (In other planetary news, ancient meteorites have changed the story of Earth's water.)
Summary: NASA is offering people the opportunity to send their names to Mars on a microchip aboard the Orion spacecraft, with over 1.3 million people already signed up and a deadline of October 31st to submit names for the first launch on December 4th.
Story: – Three people were killed with a crossbow Thursday afternoon in Toronto, Reuters reports. According to the CBC, police responded to reports of a stabbing to find three people with crossbow bolts in them inside a residential garage in a suburban area of the city. "It was going on for about five minutes—the screaming," a neighbor says. "After that, all quiet." The victims—two men and a woman—are believed to be related. However, it's unknown if they were specifically targeted, the Toronto Star reports. At least one other person was injured in the attack. Police say the crossbow attack is connected to a suspicious package that forced the evacuation of a mixed-use condo building housing a daycare later Thursday afternoon in downtown Toronto. Police aren't saying how the incidents were connected or what was in the package. A 35-year-old man with minor injuries was arrested in connection with the crossbow attack. He has not been identified, and police aren't sure of a motive. The investigation is ongoing.
Summary: Three people were killed and at least one other person injured in a crossbow attack in a suburban area of Toronto, with police linking the incident to a suspicious package that forced the evacuation of a condo building and daycare center in the city's downtown area.
Story: – Halliburton admits it destroyed evidence related to the construction of the notorious Macondo well that ruptured in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico and caused the biggest oil spill in US history, reports Reuters. Eleven rig workers were killed. The company will plead guilty to the charge and pay the maximum fine of $200,000, the Justice Department announced. Halliburton also made a voluntary $55 million payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Halliburton destroyed the evidence during an internal investigation into what went wrong and who was to blame. BP owned the well, but Halliburton oversaw the pouring of cement during its drilling, explains the Times-Picayune of New Orleans. Halliburton recommended that BP use 21 "centralizers," or metal collars, on the well, but BP used only six. When Halliburton ran simulated tests during its spill investigation, the results showed that it made little difference whether BP used six or 21. That didn't please Halliburton execs, so they ordered the results destroyed, say the feds. They did the same with results from a second simulation that reached the same conclusion. (Read the full Justice Department explanation via Boing Boing.)
Summary: Halliburton admitted destroying evidence related to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, including internal tests that showed the use of only six centralizers on the well did not significantly impact the disaster, and will pay a $200,000 fine and made a voluntary $55 million payment to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
Story: – Indiana University sophomore Lauren Spierer hasn't been seen since Friday, and family and friends are showing how social media has transformed missing persons' cases, reports the Washington Post. They've launched Facebook groups and Twitter posters and even gotten celebs such as Alyssa Milano and Ryan Seacrest to tweet her photo. Unfortunately, no leads have emerged, and Bloomington police suspect foul play, reports the South Bend Tribune. The 20-year-old was last seen by friends walking back to her apartment about 4:30am, and she had neither shoes nor a phone with her. The search has consumed the campus and community, echoing one from more than a decade ago, notes the AP. The father of that missing girl, whose remains were eventually found and her killer imprisoned, is now helping in the search for Spierer. "After a period of time—after you've searched, you've exhausted the contacts—that's when a real feeling of fear creeps in," he says. "You realize no one knows where your child is."
Summary: Lauren Spierer, an Indiana University sophomore, has been missing since Friday and her friends and family have launched a social media campaign to find her, but despite celebrity involvement and community search efforts, no leads have emerged and police suspect foul play.
Story: – For a few seconds, a light illuminated Brooke Hughes' face. "Are you going live?" a voice asked, but Hughes didn't have time to respond. With the sound of squealing tires, the Facebook Live video went dark after midnight on Tuesday, reports the Scranton Times-Tribune. By the time a bearded man appeared to pick up Hughes' phone and stop the recording seven minutes later, Hughes, 18, and her passenger Chaniya Morrison-Toomey, 19, were likely dead. Police say a tractor-trailer hit Hughes' car from behind as it drove slowly in the right lane of Interstate 380 near Tobyhanna, Penn., where the posted speed limit is 70mph, per the Times-Tribune. The car, which a state trooper said was driving with a "doughnut" tire, hit a guardrail before bursting into flames, per WFMZ. The women from Lackawanna County were pronounced dead at the scene, though their bodies were unrecognizable. The driver of the tractor-trailer was uninjured; it isn't clear if he'll face charges. Police say the live video—later posted to Hughes' Facebook page and watched at least 7,000 times before it was removed—will be an important piece of evidence as they investigate. "It broke me," says a friend of the teens who watched the video after driving around with Hughes and Morrison-Toomey in the hours before the crash. She was later dropped off in Scranton, but "I feel like if I went [with them], I could have stopped it somehow," she says. Adds a friend of Hughes who also watched the video: "I [saw] light, and then I heard the crash." (Three men were gunned down on Facebook Live.)
Summary: A Facebook Live video of two teenage girls, Brooke Hughes and Chaniya Morrison-Toomey, showed them driving slowly on a highway before their car was hit by a tractor-trailer and burst into flames, killing them both, with the driver of the tractor-trailer uninjured and facing uncertain charges.
Story: – UK police are digging up a property previously owned by the mother of a convicted killer in the hope of solving a 32-year-old cold case. Real estate agent Suzy Lamplugh, then 25, vanished on July 28, 1986, after leaving her London offices to meet an unknown "Mr. Kipper" at a property in Fulham and was presumed dead in 1994. On Tuesday, Met Police confirmed officers were searching a property formerly owned by murder suspect John Cannan's mother. Later imprisoned for 35 years for the rape and murder of a Bristol woman, Cannan had finished serving a six-year sentence for rape just three days before Lamplugh vanished and was known to be in Fulham at the time, report the Guardian and BBC. Though he's denied involvement, Cannan also went by Kipper while in prison, per ITV News. While a "Mr. Kipper" has never been traced, witnesses do recall seeing Lamplugh arguing with a man at her appointment. Her car was later found 1.5 miles away with its doors open and Lamplugh's purse inside, per the BBC. The owner of the property now being examined in Birmingham, who purchased it from Cannan's mother in 1992, says it was also searched "on and off" from the end of 2003 to spring 2004. This time, authorities are actually digging—removing the concrete floor of a dismantled garage behind the semi-detached home, reports the BBC, which adds the sad note that both of Lamplugh's parents are now deceased. Her mother died in 2011 following two strokes and an Alzheimer's diagnosis, per Sky News, while her father reportedly died in June after a battle with Parkinson's disease. (A husband is charged in a cold case murder in Wisconsin.)
Summary: UK police are digging up a property previously owned by the mother of a convicted killer in Fulham, London, in hopes of solving the 32-year-old cold case of real estate agent Suzy Lamplugh, who vanished in 1986 after meeting an unknown "Mr. Kipper" and whose car was found 1.5 miles away with her purse inside, with witnesses recalling an argument between Lamplugh and a man at her appointment, and the owner of the property confirming it was searched multiple times between 2003 and 2004.
Story: – Jeb Bush and a handful of other GOP presidential hopefuls are heading to Las Vegas later this week to court big bucks—mostly from the pocket of casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, the LA Times reports. Bush will be featured speaker at the Republican Jewish Coalition (for donors offering $25,000 or more, Time notes), followed by talks from Govs. Chris Christie, Scott Walker, and John Kasich for lesser donors. All have their eye on billionaire Adelson, who almost single-handedly sustained Newt Gingrich's run for the GOP nomination in 2012 by giving his "super PAC" $10 million. Adelson later backed Mitt Romney's super PAC, and Romney visited Jerusalem to address US-Israeli ties and the Iranian nuclear threat—two major concerns for Adelson. While new hopefuls court Adelson, other speakers will include Israeli Ambassador to the US Ron Derber, and Saturday's keynote speaker, Dick Cheney. One politician who won't attend: Sen. Rand Paul, whose father was the sole 2012 candidate not invited to the RJC forum in 2011. The RJC is a major force behind a Senate bill to slap Iran with new sanctions, but the White House threatened to veto it, saying it could damage negotiation efforts.
Summary: Jeb Bush and several other GOP presidential hopefuls are traveling to Las Vegas to court donations from casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who played a significant role in supporting Newt Gingrich's 2012 campaign and has been a major force behind sanctions against Iran.
Story: – While putting yourself in the way of stampeding bulls is considered a matter of personal choice at Pamplona's annual festival, authorities say slowing down for a selfie while doing so is just plain stupid. A runner who was filmed trying to get a photo of himself inches ahead of the bulls at this year's festival could face a fine of $4,100 under a new law banning runners from using recording devices, reports the Guardian. A picture of the man has been circulated with the hashtag #Eltonmóvil—"the idiot with the mobile"—and commentators have sharply criticized him for putting other runners in danger. The selfie-snapping runner was filmed by Spanish network TVE, which has been criticized itself for urging participants to send their best selfies in for a prize, reports the Local. "Be careful, we didn't quite mean that," the network tweeted after the man's photo surfaced. The festival wraps up today and so far, four Spaniards have been gored and one American: the co-author of How to Survive the Bulls of Pamplona.
Summary: A runner at Pamplona's annual festival was filmed trying to take a selfie while running ahead of the bulls, potentially putting himself and other runners in danger, and could face a fine of $4,100 under a new law banning recording devices.
Story: – Apple has started placing orders for screens for its next iPhone, and this time it's going big, according to a South Korean newspaper report picked up by Reuters. The new displays will be 4.6-inch "retina" displays, and the updated phone will launch sometime around the second quarter this year, the paper said. While Apple started the trend of smartphones with large touchscreens, its 3.5-inch screen has started to look diminutive next to offerings like Samsung's Galaxy Nexus' 4.65 inches. But MacRumors is dubious about the report, noting that numerous previous whispers put the new screen at 4 inches, and that many companies making iPhone cases seem to be betting on that. One source with a good track record said the new iPhone would have a longer, 4-inch display and an aluminum casing, but was "still in the engineering phase, not early production." Apple Insider is also dubious of the second quarter launch date; previous reports have always put it in September or October.
Summary: Apple has reportedly placed orders for new 4.6-inch "retina" displays for its next iPhone, which is expected to launch sometime in the second quarter of this year, according to a South Korean newspaper report, but there is uncertainty about the exact screen size and launch date due to conflicting reports and doubts from industry sources.
Story: – Chicago Blackhawks star Patrick Kane's hockey career could be over just two months after he won the Stanley Cup. The player is being investigated for an alleged rape last weekend in Hamburg, NY, where he lives during the off-season, police sources tell the Buffalo News. The sources say a local woman accused the 26-year-old of sexual assault, but he has not yet been charged with a crime and police officers have been banned from publicly discussing the case. A neighbor tells the Chicago Sun-Times that police officers, some of them wearing plastic gloves, searched Kane's home on Sunday night. The NHL and the Blackhawks say they are aware of the investigation and are "following developments," the News reports. Kane, who is one of the biggest celebrities in the Buffalo area, has been involved in off-ice incidents in the past, including an altercation with a cab driver in 2009 which led to assault charges. He was scheduled to bring the Stanley Cup to Buffalo this weekend but it's not clear whether the victory celebration will go ahead, the AP reports.
Summary: Patrick Kane, a star player for the Chicago Blackhawks, is under investigation for alleged rape in New York, with police searching his home and the NHL and team following developments, despite Kane's history of off-ice incidents.
Story: – Mitt Romney and President Obama are taking two very different approaches on how they'll spend their last few hours as candidates, reports CNN. Obama will follow presidential candidate tradition and hunker down in his hometown of Chicago to await an outcome, as well as his personal tradition of playing a little basketball. He'll also do a couple of satellite interviews. The Republican nominee, meanwhile, is breaking with tradition in a sprint to the end, with last-minute rallies planned in Cleveland and Pittsburgh, and radio interviews in Virginia and Ohio, reports ABC News. Romney voted this morning in Belmont, Mass., with wife Ann and son Tagg.
Summary: President Obama is hunkering down in Chicago to await the election outcome while playing basketball and doing satellite interviews, while Mitt Romney is breaking with tradition with last-minute rallies and radio interviews in key states.
Story: – Egyptian leader Mohamed Morsi went on state TV today and suggested talks with opposition leaders on Saturday, reports the BBC. Morsi also expressed sorrow over the deaths of protesters, but said he would not tolerate anyone trying to overthrow his "legitimate government." Nor did he rescind any of the extra powers he recently assumed, as opponents have demanded. Al-Jazeera sums it up as "a few half-measures and no meaningful concessions to an increasingly angry opposition." It's not clear yet whether the speech will ease the protests, and news coverage seems to be of two minds on the tone: Wall Street Journal: "Egypt's leader made a tentative concession to his opponents, inviting them to join a national dialogue on Saturday ..." AP: "Morsi offered nothing concrete to defuse the country's worst political crisis in nearly two years in a nationally televised speech ..."
Summary: Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi called for talks with opposition leaders on Saturday, but offered no concrete concessions to address the ongoing political crisis, with news coverage suggesting a mixed reaction to his speech.
Story: – Australia's "Smash a Strawberry" campaign can be easily misinterpreted if one isn't up to date on Australian slang. Here, "smash" refers to devouring a strawberry, rather than turning it into mush. Some might prefer to do the latter, however, after at least 100 reported cases of needles found in fruit. While many cases are believed to be hoaxes or copycat events stemming from original cases in Queensland, sewing needles and pins have been found in strawberries from various brands in all six Australian states, while two other cases involve an apple and banana, reports CNN. Fearing the effects on the country's multimillion-dollar fruit industry as supermarkets pull strawberries from shelves—one grower describes dumping $35,000 worth of fruit per day, per the Telegraph—politicians are encouraging Australians to #SmashAStrawb in support. "Get behind our local industry. Slice them in half and #SmashAStrawb to help out our local growers today," Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan tweeted Tuesday. Another politician published his family's secret strawberry jam recipe, per CNN. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday announced the maximum prison sentence for food tampering would be raised from 10 to 15 years. Though there are no reports of serious injuries, "it's not a joke, it's not funny, you're putting the livelihoods of hard-working Australians at risk and you're scaring children," he said. As international strawberry exports undergo X-ray scans, three states are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to culprits' convictions, per ABC Australia. CTV News reports there's been one arrest: a young boy in New South Wales, who cops say he admitted to placing needles in some of the cases as a "prank."
Summary: In Australia, the "Smash a Strawb" campaign to support local fruit growers has been met with confusion and concern after reports of needles found in strawberries and other fruits, with some people interpreting the phrase as "smashing" the fruit into mush rather than eating it, leading to a wave of hoaxes and copycat incidents.
Story: – Details are coming to light in yesterday's shooting spree north of Philadelphia, as police search for the suspect and communities in Montgomery and Bucks counties hunker down. Bradley William Stone, a 35-year-old former Marine reservist who spent a few months in Iraq and is said to have PTSD, is suspected of killing his ex-wife and five of his former in-laws, CNN reports. The first 911 call came in around 4:30am yesterday, and police found Stone's former mother-in-law and former grandmother-in-law dead in a house in Lansdale. Shortly thereafter, a neighbor of Stone's ex-wife, Nicole, also called 911; police found Nicole Stone, 33, dead at an apartment in Lower Salford. The couple's two daughters, believed to be around 8 and 5 years old, lived with Nicole Stone, but they were unharmed; Stone dropped them off with one of his neighbors in Pennsburg around 5:30am. The Stones divorced in 2009 and were said to be in a bitter custody dispute. Around 8am, police found Nicole Stone's sister, her husband, and their 14-year-old daughter dead in their home in Souderton; their 17-year-old son was wounded and is being treated in a Philadelphia hospital. Before the teen was taken out of the house on a stretcher, SWAT teams had surrounded the home and Stone was believed to have barricaded himself inside, ABC News reports. But upon entering the home after firing a diversionary device, officers did not find Stone, NBC Philadelphia reports. A man resembling Stone and wearing fatigues attacked a man in Doylestown, in neighboring Bucks County, last night, demanding his car keys; the man had a gun and fired shots at the suspect, who was last seen running into the woods. "We do not know where he is," says the district attorney, who noted that officials have his vehicle, so it's not clear how he's traveling. Schools in Upper Perkiomen have closed today as a precaution.
Summary: A former Marine reservist, Bradley William Stone, is suspected of killing his ex-wife and five former in-laws in a shooting spree in Montgomery and Bucks counties, Pennsylvania, with police searching for him and schools closed as a precaution.
Story: – Chad Jones, a New York Giants draft pick who was a two-sport star at LSU, is in guarded condition and in danger of losing his left foot after a car accident early this morning in New Orleans, the Shreveport Times reports. Jones, a safety who entered the draft after his junior year, was trapped in his 2010 Range Rover for 20 minutes but was able to give emergency workers his father's cellphone number, the Baton Rouge Advocate reports. "We're strong and we're praying," said Al Jones, a high school principal in New Orleans. "I'm used to making those phone calls and now we've received one. It's heartbreaking." Chad Jones, the Giants' third-round pick and a Houston Astros draftee in 2007, was on the LSU teams that won the national football title in 2007 and the College World Series in 2009. "We are praying for Chad and ask that everyone does the same," his agent said in a statement.
Summary: New York Giants draft pick Chad Jones is in guarded condition and at risk of losing his left foot after a car accident in New Orleans, with his father expressing hope and asking for prayers.
Story: – A 17-year-old track star and valedictorian candidate drowned while volunteering at a beach cleanup in Southern California, My News LA reports. Thuy Tran, a student at Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School in Los Angeles, was swept away by a wave at Santa Monica Beach on Saturday and wasn't found for an hour. According to KTLA, she was in the water with a number of other young people at the time, possibly swimming in an inshore hole, which is a trench in the sand close to shore. Lifeguards helping other people out of the water weren't aware initially that there was a person missing and possibly submerged; when they discovered this and Thuy was finally found, she was rushed to the hospital and put on life support, KABC reports. She died Sunday, the coroner's office confirmed Thursday. "Our hearts go out to the relatives and friends of this exceptional young woman," school district superintendent Michelle King said in a statement. Thuy had just opened up the electronic letter accepting her to Stanford last week, and the school's dean of admissions has since sent her family the official acceptance note, along with a condolence letter, her original application, and what would have been her admissions info, a school spokeswoman tells the Los Angeles Times. "Even in her short association with us as an applicant and newly admitted student to Stanford's Class of 2020, we knew she was absolutely the right person to be a part of the incoming class," the letter read. Local track teams plan to wear ribbons in Thuy's honor during the upcoming season. (Two BASE jumpers survived their leap into the Pacific—but were then swept away by the waves.)
Summary: A 17-year-old valedictorian candidate and track star drowned while volunteering at a beach cleanup in Southern California, after being swept away by a wave and not found for an hour, despite being in the water with other young people, including possibly swimming in an inshore hole.
Story: – Law enforcement officials have identified the second shooter at the "Draw Muhammad" cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, yesterday but say they don't know too much about him, CNN reports. Unlike the first identified shooter—30-year-old Elton Simpson—Nadir Soofi, 34, hadn't already attracted the FBI's attention. Soofi was Simpson's roommate in a Phoenix, Ariz., apartment, and had studied pre-med from 1998 to 2003 at the University of Utah, but the school says he left without earning a degree, the Washington Post reports. Mediate reports that a journalist tweeted this photo of Soofi. Both gunmen were shot dead after they allegedly opened fire at the Curtis Culwell Center, where the event was taking place; neither got any further than the parking lot.
Summary: Law enforcement officials have identified the second shooter at the "Draw Muhammad" cartoon contest in Garland, Texas, as 34-year-old Nadir Soofi, who had a previous connection to the first shooter Elton Simpson and studied pre-med at the University of Utah before leaving without earning a degree.
Story: – In what he calls a "terribly sad day," the editorial page editor of the Denver Post tendered his resignation Thursday, the culmination to a tumultuous month at the paper. Chuck Plunkett's departure was announced in an email from Lee Ann Colacioppo, the paper's editor, per the Post. Plunkett, who's been with the newspaper for 15 years, didn't get into the details in an interview. "Being the editorial page editor of the Denver Post was a years' long goal of mine, and I thoroughly loved the position," he says, adding he didn't want to go and that he'd hoped to "mature in the role and create an editorial page that Denver and Colorado could be proud of." His stepping down took place after a scathing Post editorial in April that ripped into the paper's "vulture capitalist" parent company, Alden Global Capital, which owns Post owner Digital First Media. That editorial slammed management for not being willing to "do good journalism" and encouraged it to sell the paper to a company that would. Plunkett offered more details to the New York Times, revealing he resigned after another editorial he'd slated for this Sunday was nixed by a Post executive. The new editorial addressed Alden's slashing of newsroom jobs despite profitability, its attempts at censoring the Post newsroom, and the recent firing of another DFM editorial page editor, Dave Krieger of the Boulder Daily Camera, for a similarly biting editorial. "What they were asking was [for me] to be quiet," he says. "For me to just sit quietly by would be hypocritical." He added to the Post, "I hope all the journalists who have worked for the … Post and continue to toil in this difficult environment can continue to do good work."
Summary: Chuck Plunkett, the editorial page editor of the Denver Post, resigned after 15 years due to disagreements with the paper's parent company, Alden Global Capital, over its management of the newsroom and its refusal to prioritize good journalism.
Story: – A young mother in Bellefontaine, Ohio, has confessed to an incomprehensible crime and given a reason that's equally hard to understand. Police say 23-year-old Brittany Pilkington has told investigators that she killed her three young sons over a 13-month period, and that she did so because her husband, Joseph Pilkington, wasn't paying enough attention to their 3-year-old daughter, the Columbus Dispatch reports. She has been charged with murder in the deaths of 3-month-old Niall, who died in July last year; 4-year-old Gavin, who died in April this year; and 3-month-old Noah, who died yesterday—just six days after a judge returned him to his parents when a coroner decided the other two boys hadn't died of suspicious causes. Noah had been removed from the home soon after his birth, along with the 3-year-old girl, and Logan County Prosecutor William Goslee says his office wanted to keep them in state custody for longer, the Dayton Daily News reports. He tells the Dispatch that hours after the latest death, Pilkington admitted smothering the boys with a blanket and in her mind, "she was protecting her daughter from being not as loved as the boys were by their father." Joseph Pilkington's brother tells the Dispatch that his brother—who found the bodies of the first two boys after returning home from work at a Honda plant—is so distraught that he's considering admitting himself to the hospital. "I just feel real bad for my brother," he says. "It's messed up." The couple married when Brittany was 18 and Joseph was 38.
Summary: A 23-year-old mother, Brittany Pilkington, has confessed to killing her three young sons over a 13-month period, citing her husband's lack of attention to their 3-year-old daughter as the reason, despite being returned to their parents just days before the latest death.
Story: – A preliminary nuclear deal between Iran and world powers is now in effect. "In line with the implementation of the Geneva joint plan of action, Iran suspended the production of 20% enriched uranium in the presence of UN nuclear watchdog inspectors" at two sites, an Iranian atomic energy official told Iranian news, per AFP. UN authorities have confirmed the news, diplomats tell the BBC. The agreement allows the country to continue enriching uranium to 5%. As for the other side of the deal, "the sanctions iceberg against Iran is melting," says Iran's nuclear head. Assuming the EU is satisfied with the enrichment cuts, Iran should today be allowed to restart petrochemical exports as well as trade in gold, meaning billions of dollars for its economy, the BBC notes. Under the deal, Iran is also required to convert half of its existing 20% enriched uranium to oxide; the other half must be diluted to 5% enrichment, CBS News reports. In exchange for the dilution, Iran will gain access to some of its frozen foreign assets worth as much as $4.2 billion, the New York Times reports.
Summary: Iran has suspended the production of 20% enriched uranium at two sites in accordance with a preliminary nuclear deal with world powers, allowing it to continue enriching uranium to 5% and potentially gain access to frozen foreign assets worth billions of dollars.
Story: – Perhaps palm readers are on to something. A massive study of some 140,000 people aged 35 to 70 in 17 countries finds the palms of a person's hands may be better than blood pressure at indicating their risk of heart attack, stroke, or an early death. Specifically, researchers say quick declines in the force of a person's grip—as opposed to a slower, natural decline with age—show an increased risk for health problems, the BBC reports. Researchers monitored participants’ health over four years and used a handgrip dynamometer to measure grip strength, Harvard Health reports. Each 11-pound drop in grip strength was associated with an increase in a person's risk of dying from heart disease by 17% and from any cause by 16%. The weaker grip was also associated with an increased risk of stroke by 9% and heart attack by 7%, researchers say. There was no connection, however, to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cancer, or other chronic conditions. Researchers aren't sure why evidence of a weak heart might appear in a person's grip, but it's possible that hardened arteries hinder muscle strength. Experts also say a person’s grip is a strong indicator of a person’s biological age—a measure of body function influenced by physical fitness, illnesses, and strength—rather than their chronological age. "Grip strength could be an easy and inexpensive test to assess an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease," a researcher says in a press release. "Further research is needed to establish whether efforts to improve muscle strength are likely to reduce an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease." (A study claims our hands were designed to punch.)
Summary: A study of over 140,000 people found that a rapid decline in grip strength, as opposed to a natural decline with age, is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and early death.
Story: – Even with her best score yet, Bristol Palin still couldn't stay out of last place on Dancing With the Stars. The semifinals—yes, shockingly, Palin made it all the way to the top four—started last night, and the teen mom scored 27 out of 30 for her paso doble and 26 for her waltz. Jennifer Grey landed in first place with two perfect scores, followed by Disney star Kyle Massey with two 29s and Brandy with a 27 and a 30, E! reports. If Bristol manages to win, her mom will take it as a sign that she should run for president—yes, really—click here to find out why. Or click here to see which DWTS professional Bristol claims doesn't like her.
Summary: Bristol Palin finished in last place on Dancing With the Stars semifinals despite scoring her best marks yet, with Jennifer Grey and Kyle Massey taking the top two spots.
Story: – Last night's revelation that one of the Germanwings flight's pilots was locked out of the cockpit before the plane went down and tried desperately to get back inside suggested something sinister occurred. Today, Marseilles prosecutor Brice Robin indicated that was indeed the case, saying it appears that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was at the controls, intended to "destroy this plane." Lubitz began the descent manually and "intentionally," reports the AP, and was conscious until impact. The Guardian reports that the revelations came by way of the cockpit voice recorder's last 30 minutes. The initial 20 minutes capture normal conversation, says Robin; at that point, the pilot leaves to make a "natural call." In what Robin classified as a "voluntary" move, the 28-year-old German co-pilot then manually accelerated the descent, having pressed "the buttons of the flight monitoring system," per the BBC. The pilot's entreaties to be let in go unanswered, and the co-pilot's breathing can be heard; he doesn't utter a single word. Though the plane had a keypad that could be used to gain entry outside the cockpit door, the New York Times reports by way of an Airbus video that someone in the cockpit can move a "toggle to a position marked 'locked'"; doing so renders the keypad useless for five minutes. As for Lubitz, he is "not known as a terrorist, absolutely not," says Robin, who did not categorize the move as a suicide, though "it is a legitimate question to ask." NBC News reports Lubitz signed on with the airline in September 2013 after completing his training; he had flown for 630 hours.
Summary: The co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, Andreas Lubitz, intentionally and manually descended the plane without the pilot's knowledge or consent, according to prosecutors, and was conscious until impact, despite the pilot's attempts to regain control of the cockpit.
Story: – Syria's fragile ceasefire seems to be largely holding, as renewed protests today put it to its first real test. But one Hama protester was shot dead by security forces as thousands of protesters again took to the streets, reports the BBC, while the New York Times notes that clashes had broken out in scattered areas of the country. Opposition leader Burhan Ghalioun has his doubts, saying officials have their "hand on the trigger," Reuters reports. "While we call on the Syrian people to protest strongly ... we ask them to be cautious because the regime will not respect the ceasefire and will shoot." "As soon as there is a real ceasefire, people will come out to the streets, demonstrating and demanding" President Bashar al-Assad's exit, says an opposition spokesman. "So I think the regime has to retaliate by opening fire again." Meanwhile, the UN Security Council is preparing a resolution allowing monitors to keep an eye on the tentative peace. While the ceasefire is a step forward, "the world is watching, however, with skeptical eyes since many promises previously made by the government of Syria have not been kept," said UN chief Ban Ki-moon.
Summary: Syrian protesters took to the streets despite a fragile ceasefire, with one killed by security forces, as opposition leaders express doubts about the government's commitment to the agreement and the UN prepares a resolution to monitor the situation.
Story: – George Zimmerman's defense team is painting an unflattering picture of Trayvon Martin through his text messages, which it released yesterday—and they contain a haunting warning from a friend: "Boy don’t get one planted in ya chest," the friend writes. The text came three months before Trayvon was shot, the Miami Herald reports. The same friend earlier said Trayvon was "turning into a lil hoodlum." ("No not at all," Trayvon replied.) In another text, Trayvon says he was suspended from school over fighting; later, he says he fought a friend who "snitched on me." "I lost da 1st round :) but won da 2nd nd 3rd," he says. In other texts, however, he suggests that he got in trouble for fights he wasn't involved in. Several later messages appear to discuss getting a gun, with questions like "U got heat??" and a later question posed to him: "You want a 22 revolver?" The texts also contain discussions of marijuana; Trayvon gets called a "weedhead." The Herald describes the release as "part of Zimmerman's defense plan to put [Trayvon] posthumously on trial." Prosecutors say the text messages, as well as Trayvon's school records and some photos, aren't pertinent evidence; images like one of him displaying gold teeth play on "stereotypical and close-minded thinking." The Orlando Sentinel has more on the defense's argument for the evidence (for instance, it's expected to argue that marijuana references are admissible because Zimmerman said in his 911 call that Trayvon was acting like he was high). The judge will decide whether to allow the materials.
Summary: George Zimmerman's defense team released text messages from Trayvon Martin that portray him as a troubled teen involved in fights and drug use, while prosecutors argue that the evidence is irrelevant and could play into stereotypical thinking.
Story: – It was a great idea—until it really, really wasn't. Burger King on Wednesday launched a 15-second ad designed to promote the Whopper in a wholly 2017 way. A man dressed as an employee bemoans the lack of time available to explain what a Whopper is, then leans into the camera and offers this: "OK Google, what is the Whopper burger?" Any viewer who had a Google Home near the TV would see the device activated, and it would prattle off the Wikipedia entry for the burger—but things didn't exactly go as planned. As the Verge reports, the trouble with relying on Wikipedia is that anyone can edit it, and it appears that Burger King did just that, perhaps in violation of Wikipedia's rules against "shameless self-promotion." A first line that once framed the burger as a "signature hamburger product" was altered to reference a "flame-grilled patty made with 100% beef," and the Verge found evidence the edit was made by Burger King’s marketing chief. But the edits didn't stop there. Gizmodo describes the ad as "crashing like the ... Hindenburg" in a piece that rounds up some of the more creative edits the masses then made to the line, which variously framed the burger as being made from "rat and toenail clippings" and "100% medium-sized child" and being topped with "cyanide." But the hijinks were to be short-lived. Google, which had no hand in the commercial, apparently disabled the prompt from working within three hours of the ad's debut, reports the Verge. Wikipedia took action, too, returning the entry to its original format and locking it from editing. (Another burger ad recently made headlines.)
Summary: Burger King's attempt to use Google Home to promote their Whopper burger backfired when the ad triggered Wikipedia edits from unauthorized users, including one that framed the burger as made from "rat and toenail clippings" and "100% medium-sized child," and another that disabled the prompt within three hours of the ad's debut.
Story: – Pretty soon, thousands of new Tesla owners won't even need to leave their homes for car repairs—and they'll get a cup of espresso to boot. Tesla's Model 3, which hits the streets later this month, will cost $35,000—or about half the price of its previous models, the AP reports. The Model 3 is expected to create hundreds of thousands of new Tesla owners at a time when current owners are already complaining about long wait times for repairs. According to Business Insider, a former Tesla employee called the repair process for his Model S a "nightmare," and other Tesla owners have said it can take weeks to get repairs done. On Tuesday, Tesla announced how it will handle what the Wall Street Journal calls the "most critical test" in its history: The company is hiring 1,400 repair technicians, adding 100 service centers, and deploying 350 new service vans. Currently there are only 150 or so Tesla service centers and 130 repair vans worldwide. Tesla says it can diagnose 90% of maintenance issues remotely and can fix 80% of them without the car being brought to a service center. The new repair vans—equipped with espresso machines and snacks for the customer—will be dispatched to homes and roadsides, ideally freeing up space at service centers.
Summary: Tesla is hiring 1,400 repair technicians, adding 100 service centers, and deploying 350 new service vans to address long wait times for repairs, as the company's Model 3 model hits the streets at a lower price point of $35,000 and is expected to create hundreds of thousands of new owners.
Story: – Millions of people in cities including New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas are out of luck if they try to tune in to CBS, reports USA Today. Time Warner Cable began blacking out the network's signal for its subscribers as of 5pm Eastern in several markets because the two sides weren't able to reach a deal on fees. Viewer anger might be muted considering we're in the summer TV doldrums, notes the New York Times. Probably the biggest thing on the network's horizon is the PGA golf championship next week. Your dueling quotes: Time Warner: "CBS has refused to have a productive discussion. It's become clear that no matter how much time we give them, they're not willing to come to reasonable terms." CBS: "We deeply regret this ill-advised action, which is injurious not only to our many affected viewers, but also to Time Warner Cable itself." The New York Post says CBS wants to be paid $2 a month by Time Warner for each subscriber, up from somewhere between 50 cents and $1 now. The network's contract expired in June, and the two sides had been negotiating since.
Summary: Time Warner Cable has blacked out CBS's signal in several markets, including New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas, due to a dispute over fees, with CBS seeking an increase of $2 per month per subscriber and Time Warner refusing to reach a deal.
Story: – Greg Smith's new book bashing former employer Goldman Sachs has been met with a yawn, its critics complaining that it contains no bombshell revelations not found in his celebrated New York Times op-ed. "Everyone already knows the 'squid' isn't on the side of the angels," writes David Weidner at MarketWatch. But Matthew Yglesias at Slate thinks there's value in being outraged over things "everyone already knows," and indeed, thinks we need to revive the concept of moralistic outrage in general. "Norms matter," Yglesias writes. "People work for money. But people also work for status, and people work because they take pride in a job well done." Sure, Goldman Sachs is a business designed to make money, but everyone's in business to make money. If a doctor bragged that he'd made money conning patients, we'd frown on that. We can't outlaw all the "bad" ways to make money, "but that makes it more important, not less, to maintain a social sense of outrage around sleazy behavior." Click for Yglesias' full column, or for Weidner's full column.
Summary: Matthew Yglesias argues that while Goldman Sachs' business practices may be unethical, it is important to maintain a social sense of outrage around such behavior to uphold norms and values in society.
Story: – A new allegation of inappropriate behavior against Geoffrey Rush comes from a fellow Australian, who also happens to be a well-recognized face from Orange Is the New Black, reports Deadline. Yael Stone, the 33-year-old actress who plays Lorna Morello on the Netflix series, "is scared" and not sleeping, she tells Bari Weiss in the New York Times. That's because she's coming forward with accusations against "one of our national treasures," as Stone puts it to Leigh Sales in an interview for the ABC's 7.30 show. Stone says when she worked with Rush, now 67, on a stage production of The Diary of a Madman eight years ago, he used a mirror to watch her as she showered, sent her erotic texts, and danced naked in front of her in their shared dressing room, among other things. Stone says she didn't speak up earlier (though she says she did once write Rush a letter that he never responded to) because she feared offending her "onetime hero," as well as being sued for defamation under Australia's strict libel laws. She feels some sympathy for Rush, noting that because the very famous are rarely told no, they may engage in behaviors that get incrementally worse. "We need compassion for that confusion," she says. In a statement, Rush says he regrets any "distress" Stone felt from the "spirited enthusiasm I generally bring to my work," adding that her memories "are incorrect and in some instances have been taken completely out of context." Stone told Sales she recognizes the possible repercussions, both financial and for her place in the acting world, for speaking out. "If that happens, I think it's worth it," she said. (Rush says he's lost his appetite over allegations.)
Summary: Actress Yael Stone accuses Geoffrey Rush of inappropriate behavior, including watching her shower through a mirror, sending erotic texts, and dancing naked in front of her, during a stage production eight years ago.
Story: – At least 32 people were killed—more than half of them boys between the ages of 10 and 16—when a suicide bomber blew himself up at an amateur soccer tournament Friday in Iraq, AFP reports. Officials were handing out trophies to players following the tournament outside the town of Iskandariya when the bomber, who himself appeared to be in his teens, pushed through the crowd and detonated a suicide vest. According to Al Jazeera, the explosion injured 95 people. In the aftermath of the explosion, goal posts and a soccer ball could be seen covered with blood. "Most of the crowd were young people, I could see them strewn across the field, some dead, others wounded asking for help," a 20-year-old witness says. "It was just chaos." The victims of the bombing, which the Telegraph has video of, were buried Saturday as words of support and condemnation poured in from around the world. "Football is a powerful force for good and our game has a long history of bringing people together even during conflicts around the world," the Asian Football Confederation said in a statement. "Using football and sport stadiums as a stage for these heinous acts of violence is a cowardly, completely unjust, and indiscriminate act." ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. The terrorist organization has been losing ground in Iraq for a year, and experts warn it will step up suicide attacks on civilians as it gets desperate.
Summary: A suicide bomber killed 32 people, mostly boys aged 10-16, at an amateur soccer tournament in Iraq, injuring 95 others, with the attack claimed by ISIS as the terrorist group loses ground in the country.
Story: – Two days after Donna Brazile caused a stir by claiming, in an excerpt from her new book, that the Clinton campaign essentially rigged the Democratic primary, the former head of the Democratic National Committee is at it again. The Washington Post reports Brazile says she seriously considered replacing Hillary Clinton and Sen. Tim Kaine with Joe Biden and Sen. Cory Booker in the lead up to the 2016 presidential election to draw in more working-class voters and because the Clinton campaign was "anemic" and had "the odor of failure." In her book, Brazile says she reminded Clinton aides in the wake of the candidate's pneumonia in September that she had the power to replace a nominee who became disabled. She says she ultimately decided not to do it because she "thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud and excited about her." Meanwhile, NBC News reports a memo from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook to DNC CEO Amy Dacey puts the deal Brazile claims rigged the primary in better context. The Clinton campaign did agree to raise money for the DNC in exchange for joint authority over "staffing, budgeting, expenditures," and more. But it also stated: "All activities performed under this agreement will be focused exclusively on preparations for the General Election and not the Democratic Primary." It continued: "Further we understand you may enter into similar agreements with other candidates." Howard Dean tweets that if the memo is accurate, then the deal entered into by the DNC and Clinton campaign has been "standard operating procedure for 15 years."
Summary: Donna Brazile claims in her book that she considered replacing Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine with Joe Biden and Cory Booker in the 2016 presidential election due to the Clinton campaign's perceived lack of momentum and her own desire to draw in more working-class voters, while the Clinton campaign's campaign manager Robby Mook disputes Brazile's claims of a rigged primary in a memo to the DNC CEO Amy Dacey, which suggests that the agreement between the Clinton campaign and the DNC was focused exclusively on the general election and not the primary.
Story: – Julia Louis-Dreyfus is back at work on Veep and says it feels "fantastic." The star of the HBO comedy series revealed last September that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer, the news coming soon after her sixth consecutive Emmy win for the role of Selina Meyer. As work began recently on the show's seventh and final season, Louis-Dreyfus told the AP: "I feel good. I feel strong. I've got energy and, yeah, back to my old tricks. It feels like I never left." The Seinfeld alum also has signed on to her first cancer awareness initiative, helping Carolina Herrera designer Wes Gordon design a flower-adorned T-shirt as part of Saks Fifth Avenue's 20th year raising money through its Key to the Cure program. The limited-edition shirt will sell for $35 at Saks stores Oct. 1-31, with 100% of proceeds passed to the AiRS Foundation, a nonprofit Louis-Dreyfus supports for its work in helping women with the costs of breast reconstruction after mastectomy. As a survivor, she said she's often asked to help out, but this is the first time she said yes. "It's hard to say no, but I've just had to be very careful about managing my time and conserving my energy," she said. "You can't spread yourself too thin." As this year's ambassador for the program, Louis-Dreyfus said she wanted a bold statement for the annual T-shirt. It features three poppies and the slogan: "We are fighters & we are fighting for a cure."
Summary: Julia Louis-Dreyfus has returned to work on the final season of Veep after being diagnosed with breast cancer, feeling "fantastic" and using her platform to support a cancer awareness initiative by designing a limited-edition T-shirt with 100% of proceeds going to a nonprofit that helps women with breast reconstruction costs.
Story: – Whitney Houston died on Feb. 11, 2012, and her daughter may die on the third anniversary of that date. Sources tell Page Six that Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has agreed to remove life support, but Brown's grandmother, Cissy Houston, suggested they wait until tomorrow to do so. They will take Brown, 21, off life support at the stroke of midnight as a way to symbolically keep mom and daughter together, a family source says. The Brown and Houston sides of the family have been arguing, but they are in agreement that it's time to say goodbye, sources say. "This is the only thing they can agree on—that she's gone [brain-dead], and there's nothing more [that] can be done for her," one explains. Filmmaker Tyler Perry has been acting as a sort of mediator, and he'll also make the funeral arrangements. Meanwhile, the investigation into how Brown ended up facedown in her bathtub continues. Sources tell WSB-TV she had injuries to her face and mouth when she was found, which, sources tell TMZ, has led investigators to focus on her boyfriend, Nick Gordon. Sources say there is a history of violence between the pair. Sources also tell People the investigation is focused on "drug use and possibly cover-up to remove evidence from the crime scene."
Summary: Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has agreed to remove her from life support on the third anniversary of Whitney Houston's death, after a long-standing argument, with the help of filmmaker Tyler Perry, but the investigation into her face-down bathtub discovery and potential violence by her boyfriend, Nick Gordon, continues.
Story: – An inmate considered dangerous is on the loose in New Mexico after a surprisingly easy escape: Authorities say Duwin Perez-Cordova hopped on a bus at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Bernalillo and then was released in downtown Albuquerque. It appears that the 27-year-old, who was accused in a December shooting, posed as another inmate, reports the Albuquerque Journal. The newspaper cites court documents alleging that Perez-Cordova "utilized another inmate’s identifiers”—he apparently took a cellmate's wrist band—before boarding the release bus about 2am Sunday. Jail officials didn't realize the mistake until about three hours after Perez-Cordova was dropped off. He had been in custody since December, when authorities say he shot a man at a car wash, reports KOB4. Perez-Cordova's criminal history also includes drug and burglary charges. “He is considered violent, and we’re asking people to not approach him if they do see him,” says a jail spokesperson. The facility is investigating the lapse—staffers are supposed to check more than wrist bands before allowing inmates to go free.
Summary: An inmate who was considered dangerous and had a history of violence, Duwin Perez-Cordova, escaped from a detention center in New Mexico by posing as another inmate and boarding a bus for release, with authorities only realizing the mistake three hours later.
Story: – Your blind spot could shrink using simple exercises, say researchers who think they could help prevent blindness and possibly even restore sight to those who've lost it. All humans have blind spots due to the lack of photoreceptors where the optic nerve passes through the retina. But we don't notice them because our brains use nearby photoreceptors to fill in the gap. The New York Times reports researchers from Australia's Queensland University used a computer monitor, an eye patch, and a picture of a ring placed directly into the blind spot to increase the sensitivity of blind-spot-adjacent photoreceptors in 10 subjects—admittedly a very small sample. After 20 days of training, the subjects had shrunk their blind spots by 10%, Live Science reports. That change, while "quite an improvement" in vision, was not noticeable to the subjects, Live Science reports, though that wasn't necessarily the important part. "The real significance is that our data shows that regions of blindness can be shrunk by training, and this may benefit people who suffer from pathological blindness," says Paul Miller, author of the study. Miller says eye exercises similar to the ones used by researchers could help fight blindness caused by macular degeneration and could be combined with other new technologies to help people see again. (New technologies such as bionic eyes currently helping blind people read again.)
Summary: Researchers have found that simple exercises can help shrink blind spots in the eyes, potentially preventing blindness and even restoring sight to those who have lost it, by increasing the sensitivity of nearby photoreceptors in the retina.
Story: – Their daughters were taken away from them; their friends and family were questioned about them molesting children; and on Tuesday—a decade later—AJ and Lisa Demaree received some amount of justice. It started when the Demarees went to a Walmart in Arizona to get more than 100 photos from a 2008 family vacation to San Diego developed, the Washington Post reports. Eight of those photos were of their daughters—ages 1, 4, and 5—playing around at bath time. According to KTVK, a Walmart employee flagged the photos as pornographic and went to the police. The Demarees' daughters were taken away by Child Protective Safety workers and sent to live with their grandparents during the month-long investigation, Courthouse News reports. No charges were filed after judges ruled the photos were harmless pictures like countless parents have taken. In 2011, the Demarees sued the two social workers who took their daughters away without a court order. And on Tuesday—after a string of defeats for the family—a federal appeals court ruled the social workers "acted unconstitutionally" and violated the Demarees' rights. “The social workers did not have reasonable cause to believe the children were at risk of serious bodily harm or molestation,” the panel of judges ruled. They found there was no reason the social workers had to rush the children out of the home before first getting a court order. A lower court had dismissed the case against the social workers in 2014 based on qualified immunity. The detective behind the investigation settled with the Demarees earlier.
Summary: AJ and Lisa Demaree received justice after a decade when a federal appeals court ruled that social workers who took their daughters away without a court order acted unconstitutionally and violated their rights.
Story: – The Amtrak train that derailed in Philadelphia last night was going more than 100mph—twice the speed limit—as it derailed while entering a curve, report the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Wall Street Journal. Each independently cites anonymous sources familiar with the investigation. The Inquirer adds that the train's unidentified engineer declined to give a statement to police while accompanied by an attorney. The conductor, meanwhile, remains hospitalized with a fractured skull. The development comes as the death toll rose to seven, with another 10 people in critical condition, reports the AP. On the brighter side, a Temple University Hospital official says most of the 23 derailment patients are "either stable or better," and most have rib fractures, CNN reports. Some people on the passenger manifest remain unaccounted for, but authorities say that could be because they weren't aboard in the first place. The train's "black box" data recorder has been recovered, but officials haven't publicly revealed what they've learned. The Philly newspaper notes that a system designed to automatically slow speeding trains is due to be in place in the Philadelphia area of the Northeast Corridor later this year.
Summary: An Amtrak train derailed in Philadelphia last night, traveling over 100mph in a curve, killing 7 and injuring 10, with the engineer declining to give a statement and the conductor hospitalized with a fractured skull, while a system designed to slow speeding trains is set to be implemented in the area later this year.
Story: – A federal jury in Milwaukee has awarded $6.7 million to a former inmate who charged she was repeatedly raped by a jail guard while she was pregnant, the Milwaukee Sentinel-Journal reports. The woman filed a civil lawsuit alleging the guard, Xavier Thicklen, began assaulting her shortly after she was locked up in early 2013. Then 19, the woman identified only as "Jane Doe" was in the early stages of pregnancy when she said Thicklen raped her at various spots in the jail. "He used his keys, his power, his authority to get in these places and rape me," she testified earlier in the trial, per the Sentinel-Journal. Officials in Milwaukee County plan to appeal the verdict. The county is liable for the payout since Thicklen was a public employee on the clock at the time of the assaults. The jury declined to award the woman compensation for being shackled during labor—she gave birth to a healthy baby girl—which her legal team claimed violated her constitutional rights. A midwife testified the restraints could slow labor and endanger the child. Prosecutors dropped four sexual assault charges against Thicklen, now 28, after he agreed to plead guilty to felony misconduct in November 2014, per Fox6. Sentenced to three days in jail, he was given credit for time served. The victim testified the assaults still bring on nightmares. "She sought justice and she is glad the system delivered that justice," her lawyer tells the Sentinel-Journal. "She hopes to prevent other women from being sexually assaulted in the Milwaukee County Jail." (A judge called a rapist ex-bishop a "good man.")
Summary: A federal jury awarded $6.7 million to a former inmate who was repeatedly raped by a jail guard in Milwaukee while she was pregnant, with the guard identified as Xavier Thicklen; the county is liable for the payout as Thicklen was a public employee at the time of the assaults.
Story: – Last week, the AP ran a story praising a CIA agent, identified only as “John,” for his key role in catching Osama bin Laden. Well, it only took two days for another journalist to identify this shadowy hero. The AP article had said the man was just outside the frame in the famous White House situation room photo. But the intelligence blog Cryptome noticed that his yellow tie wasn’t cropped out, and soon found his face in other shots on the White House Flickr feed. He even showed up in a photo with Leon Panetta two days later, wearing the same tie. The next day, an Observer reporter showed the picture to a friend, who recognized John from his days playing college basketball. The paper soon found the man’s name, address, even GPA. When they called the CIA, sources urged them not to publish it, saying John had been devastated by the article, and scared for his family. Two days later, a government official said John has been changed from an overt employee to a covert one—making it a crime to leak his identity to the press. The Observer still could have done it legally, but opted not to; it recounts the lengthy tale here.
Summary: A CIA agent, identified only as "John," was praised in an AP story for his role in capturing Osama bin Laden, but his identity was quickly revealed by a journalist who found him in a White House photo, leading to the agent's transfer to a covert position and the government's request to not publish his name.
Story: – A condemned inmate in Alabama apparently decided not to wait for the state to take his life. Jeffrey Lynn Borden, a 57-year-old Death Row inmate convicted of two 1993 murders, was found hanged in his cell early Sunday in what authorities say was an apparent suicide, AL.com reports. Borden was sentenced to death in 1995 for killing his estranged wife and her father. Court files state that after Borden brought his three children to a Christmas Eve family gathering, he shot their mother, Cheryl Borden, in front of them as she started to help the children move their things from his car, the North Jefferson News reports. He then shot her father, Roland Harris, in the back as he tried to run into the house. Borden was found hanging by a bedsheet during a security check, authorities say. Federal defender John Palombi says his office was "saddened" to hear of the death, which he blames on prison underfunding and understaffing. "Borden suffered from severe mental illness and chronic physical pain, both of which were undertreated by the Department of Corrections despite their knowledge of these issues," Palombi said in a statement. Borden was within three hours of being executed on Oct. 5 last year when a stay of execution was granted amid claims that Alabama's lethal injection method of execution was unconstitutional. The stay of execution was lifted in November and a request to reinstate it was rejected in February, though it's not clear whether Borden had been given a new execution date, Fox reports. (This condemned inmate in Nevada says he is ready to die.)
Summary: A 57-year-old Death Row inmate in Alabama, Jeffrey Lynn Borden, was found hanged in his cell early Sunday in an apparent suicide, despite being within three hours of being executed last year due to claims of unconstitutional lethal injection method.
Story: – Awww, bromance. Leonardo DiCaprio saw one of his best friends, Jonah Hill, on the street in New York City recently—so he pranked him by pretending to be a stalker-ish fan with a camera. The pair, who worked together on the Wolf of Wall Street, then engaged in an adorable hug, Mashable reports. The whole thing was caught on video. (Click for a list of on-set Hollywood pranks.)
Summary: Leonardo DiCaprio playfully pranked Jonah Hill by pretending to be a stalker-ish fan with a camera on the street in New York City, leading to an adorable hug and a viral video.
Story: – Utah's most defining feature, the Great Salt Lake, may not be long for this world. Scientists report in a Utah State University white paper that 150 years of human diversions from the rivers running into the lake have reduced water levels by 11 feet, "exposing much of the lake bed" and amounting to a roughly 50% loss of volume in that time, reports Utah Public Radio. In what the Houston Chronicle calls a "damning" paper, the researchers go on to point their fingers at state Senate Bill 80, which was heard on the same day the paper was published, calling for additional water diversions to help develop Bear River as the state's population continues to rise. "We hope this starts a conversation," a spokesperson for the Utah Division of Water Resources tells Utah Public Radio. "We hope that skier or that person who cares about the economy or the wildlife on the lake will not only look into what's happening with the lake, but look into how they can be part of the solution instead of part of the problem." His team estimates that the Bear River project alone would result in another 8.5-inch drop in elevation and the exposure of another 30 square miles of lake bed. Researchers note that California's Owens River, destroyed by diversions in the 1920s, remains one of the country's largest sources of particulate matter, causing asthma and other health problems across the region; likewise with shrinking salt lakes in Iran and Uzbekistan. (Speaking of air pollution, scientists see a link with suicides.)
Summary: Scientists warn that Utah's Great Salt Lake is losing water at an alarming rate due to human diversions from rivers running into the lake, with a 50% loss of volume in the past 150 years and a potential for further decline with the proposed Bear River project.
Story: – Police descended on the Occupy Boston protest at around 1:20am today, dispersing a second tent city that had sprung up on the Rose Kennedy Greenway, across the street from the first. A line of veterans carrying American flags tried to stand between police and the protesters, but police advanced on them and arrested the protesters, wrestling each to the ground, cable-tying them, and dragging them away, the Boston Globe reports. In a video, one can be heard screaming, “We are veterans of the United States of America!” "During the day a group of anarchists really started to run the protest," Police Commissioner Ed Davis told WCVB 5. "They weren’t listening to us." In all about 100 of the roughly 1,000 people who had occupied the Greenway were arrested. Authorities said they had demanded protesters clear the Greenway camp because they feared damage to the $150,000 worth of new shrubbery a conservancy group had planted there recently, reports the AP. Police warned protesters to leave hours beforehand, even distributing written instructions. Cops left the original camp alone, however, and Mayor Thomas Menino said protesters would be allowed to remain there.
Summary: Police arrested around 100 of the approximately 1,000 Occupy Boston protesters who had set up a second tent city on the Rose Kennedy Greenway, using force and cable-tying to disperse the protesters, despite earlier warnings and instructions to clear the area due to concerns about new shrubbery planted there.
Story: – Louis CK, of late better known for class than crass, stopped by Saturday Night Live last night for a much-anticipated post-Sandy turn as guest host, and he did not disappoint. Though it was the last show before Election Day, SNL did not trot out any big-name cameos, notes Kera Bolonik over at Salon. Rather, "this was Sandy's week, and just as the hurricane gave us a kind of reprieve from tedious 24-7 candidate-stumping coverage, so too did SNL." The result was "this was this season’s funniest and most poignant episode," she declares. Over at the Huffington Post, Mike Ryan is slightly less effusive, noting that CK is "only happy when he's 100% in charge and that seemed evident." In his comfort zone, "he was electric," but outside, "he broke character. In other words: Louis CK was Louis CK." The show's highlight: An Abe Lincoln-inspired parody of CK's own show.
Summary: Louis CK hosted Saturday Night Live for the first time since Hurricane Sandy, delivering a "funniest and most poignant episode" with a standout Abe Lincoln-inspired parody of his own show.
Story: – Some 280,000 people have signed a petition in protest of the "Americanization" of French politics. Before his election, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to create a "defined" First Lady position for his wife, which would mean giving Brigitte Macron her own office and staff, reports Reuters. But that plan isn't sitting well with many in France for a couple of reasons. Firstly, tradition: the first lady of France typically promotes charities from Elysée Palace, with help from one or two assistants and protection from security guards, reports the BBC. Secondly, timing: Macron's campaign rival, François Fillon, was dogged by allegations that he paid hundreds of thousands of euros to his wife in a sham role as a parliamentary assistant. In response to the scandal, Macron said he would bar politicians from employing relatives, which his party is now working to do. But though Macron says his wife will not receive a salary paid for by the taxpayer, some call him a hypocrite. "We cannot sanction the creation of a special status for the spouse of President Macron … during a time when ethical behavior needs to be reasserted in French politics," the petition reads, per France 24. "Brigitte Macron currently has a team of two or three aides, as well as two secretaries and two security agents," it adds. "That's enough." Some 280,000 people have signed the petition as of this writing, but it may be all for naught. French media report the creation of the new role is already in the works.
Summary: A petition with over 280,000 signatures has been circulated in France to protest the creation of a "defined" First Lady position for President Emmanuel Macron's wife, Brigitte, as it goes against tradition and comes amidst ethical scandals in French politics.
Story: – Big news on the women's health front: AP reports that the breast cancer charity Susan G. Komen for the Cure is cutting its ties with Planned Parenthood. The move, which centers on abortion, will mean the end of "hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants" for breast cancer exams. Komen's explanation: It has new rules that prohibit it from giving money to groups under federal investigation, and Planned Parenthood qualifies because of a congressional inquiry into whether it spent public money on abortions. Planned Parenthood says the charity caved to pressure from anti-abortion groups. "It's hard to understand how an organization with whom we share a mission of saving women's lives could have bowed to this kind of bullying," says President Cecile Richards. "It's really hurtful." At Slate, Amanda Marcotte agrees and calls Komen's move an "act of cowardice." The charity "has already been under serious scrutiny by those who argue that the organization cares more about shoring up their image than making real progress in the fight for women's health, and with this move today, they proved their critics right." Read her full column here. (For an opposing view, click here.)
Summary: Susan G. Komen for the Cure has cut ties with Planned Parenthood due to its federal investigation into alleged abortion spending, ending hundreds of thousands of dollars in grants for breast cancer exams, with Planned Parenthood and its supporters criticizing the move as an act of cowardice and a betrayal of the organizations shared mission to advance womens health.
Story: – A 2-year-old girl is in critical condition after she was hit in the head by falling bricks on Manhattan's Upper West Side yesterday. Greta Greene was on a bench outside the Esplanade Manhattan senior living home with her grandmother, Susan Frierson, when debris fell from the building's eighth-floor window ledge and hit the girl's head. A witness says Greta was "gushing blood from her head," reports the New York Post. She regained consciousness after an Esplanade nurse began CPR, reports NBC New York. Paramedics then rushed her to a hospital, where doctors removed part of her skull to relieve brain swelling. The New York Daily News reports she is brain dead. Frierson, 60, who was struck in the ankle and wrist, was admitted to a hospital in serious but stable condition. "The bricks just came off the building without warning," says a doorman. "I saw the grandma stagger. She was holding the baby in her arms." Authorities are investigating what caused the debris to fall from the building, built in 1919. There hadn't been any recent complaints about the facade, according to records, but work had been completed on the structure recently and at least two other windows appeared to be missing bricks yesterday, reports the Post. In 2010-2011, the building's owner paid a $6,467 fine for failing to complete a facade inspection on time. In a statement, per the New York Times, the Department of Buildings says "a violation has been issued for a failure to maintain the property in a safe and code compliant manner. The department is requiring that the property owner construct a sidewalk shed to protect the public." (A falling gargoyle killed a bride-to-be last year.)
Summary: A 2-year-old girl, Greta Greene, is in critical condition after being hit in the head by falling bricks on Manhattan's Upper West Side, with doctors removing part of her skull to relieve brain swelling and her grandmother, Susan Frierson, being admitted to the hospital with injuries to her ankle and wrist.
Story: – We're about a month away from the two-year anniversary of the earthquake that spawned Japan's devastating tsunami. Saying its effects linger far from Japanese shores is an understatement, per some recent reports: In Alaska: "You're basically standing in landfill out here," says the head of a nonprofit that focuses on ridding the coast of marine debris. NPR reports on a scene replete with refrigerators, ketchup bottles, and the more concerning Styrofoam bits, which birds, rodents, and bears have been eating. The exec says the garbage, which was observed in every beach photographed in a 2,500-mile aerial survey completed last year, isn't getting the attention it needs. Indeed, Alaska Public Radio reports that there wasn't any funding for debris cleanup included in the governor's budget, and such funding was removed from the Sandy aid bill that passed last week. In Hawaii: A refrigerator has also made its way to these shores, reports LiveScience. "These items have never before been seen on these beaches," says a marine debris specialist, who explains that they're washing ashore in what the site terms "surprisingly homogenous waves"—first oyster buoys, then refrigerator parts—due to the wind's effect. In British Columbia: Its coasts have a Styrofoam problem, too, says a helicopter pilot who has been observing the shore for three decades. "Of course there's always debris on the beaches," he said. "But I dropped down ... and, holy crap, all of a sudden you see all this stuff." An expert on the subject expects the debris to wash ashore "through next summer. I expect the worst isn't over yet." The Globe and Mail reports that the West Coast anticipates it will see as much as 1.65 million tons of debris.
Summary: The devastating tsunami that hit Japan two years ago is still having a significant impact on coastal areas around the world, with reports of marine debris, including refrigerators, ketchup bottles, and Styrofoam, washing up on beaches in Alaska, Hawaii, and British Columbia, with experts predicting that the debris will continue to arrive through next summer.
Story: – House Republicans will head to a hardware store in Virginia tomorrow to unveil their Pledge to America, billed as a comprehensive set of reforms along the lines of Newt Gingrich's Contract With America in 1994. Democrats already say it's the same-old, same-old. Politico and the Wall Street Journal hit some highlights: To "repeal and replace" the health care reform law, though popular parts such as making it illegal to deny coverage over pre-existing conditions would stay. Prevent all of the Bush tax cuts from expiring. Freeze most hiring for the federal government. Give small businesses a tax break equal to 20% of their business income. Have weekly votes on the House floor to pick winners in the "YouCut" program, in which people make suggestions online. Cancel the spending of all remaining stimulus funds. Sample language: "Like free peoples of the past, our citizens refuse to accommodate a government that believes it can replace the will of the people with its own."
Summary: House Republicans will unveil their "Pledge to America" tomorrow, a comprehensive set of reforms including repealing and replacing the healthcare reform law, freezing federal hiring, giving small businesses a tax break, and holding weekly floor votes on "YouCut" program suggestions, while also cancelling remaining stimulus funds.
Story: – Online activist group Anonymous released its promised list of alleged Ku Klux Klan members Thursday, Raw Story reports. And while the list doesn't include the promised 1,000 names, it does include the identities of nearly 400 people, plus email addresses, Facebook pages, and more, according to the Hill. "We consider this data dump as a form of resistance against the violence and intimidation tactics leveraged against the public by various members of Ku Klux Klan groups throughout history,” Operation KKK states with the release. And while the list also doesn't include the names of any politicians—as an earlier, "widely discredited" list did—it does include at least a few retired law enforcement officers. The Hill reports Anonymous started going after the KKK when a local chapter threatened violence during protests in Ferguson. The group states the list released Thursday is the culmination of 11 months of research and "digital espionage." According to Engadget, Anonymous even got some people to admit to being KKK members while chatting online. "You never know who you are talking to on the internet," Operation KKK writes. In addition to names, the list purports to include popular places to hang out online for KKK members. While none of the well-known names included on the non-Anonymous list released earlier this week were found on Thursday's list, Operation KKK did tweet that several names were removed "for further investigation," Raw Story reports.
Summary: Anonymous released a list of nearly 400 alleged Ku Klux Klan members, including email addresses, Facebook pages, and popular online hangouts, as a form of resistance against KKK violence and intimidation tactics.
Story: – Did Taylor Swift predict her split with Conor Kennedy before it happened? According to Us, in an interview recorded days ago but airing this afternoon on Katie Couric's talk show, Swift confessed: "I don't know how to have a normal relationship because I try to act normal, love from a normal place and live a normal life, but there is sort of an abnormal magnifying glass, like telescope lens, on everything that happens between me and anybody else. I don't really know that much about love, it turns out." More from the split of the century: What was behind the breakup? A source tells Radar: "Conor's just an 18-year-old kid and wasn't ready for anything super serious, but Taylor is looking for her soulmate and it kind of freaked him out with how strong she came on. Taylor is obsessed with the Kennedys and was living out a fairytale with Conor. But she was more obsessed with the idea of dating a Kennedy, than the actual Kennedy she was dating." TMZ has what might be evidence of that: Swift is still looking to buy that Hyannis Port mansion across the street from Ethel Kennedy's place, and the deal is scheduled to close in two weeks. One thing's for sure: This whole fiasco has been very embarrassing for the Kennedys, the New York Post reports. Just hours after reports of the breakup emerged, Kerry Kennedy announced in an email that Swift will be honored at a high-profile Kennedy family gala, the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights’ Ripple of Hope Awards Dinner in December. Apparently the family isn't 100% convinced things are over between Taylor and Conor for good, sources say. Click for seven more possible reasons Swift and Kennedy hit the skids.
Summary: Taylor Swift may have predicted her split with Conor Kennedy before it happened, as she confessed in an interview that she doesn't know how to have a normal relationship due to the magnifying glass effect of her celebrity status, and a source revealed that Kennedy was not ready for a serious relationship while Swift is obsessed with the Kennedys and was living out a fairytale with him.
Story: – There were about 75 million Americans in 39 states living in earthquake zones 20 years ago. Today, that number has doubled to 150 million across all 50 states, meaning about half of all Americans are now at risk from potentially damaging shaking, the Los Angeles Times reports. About 143 million of those live in the Lower 48 states. At some point, some 28 million, mostly on the West Coast, will likely experience strong shaking that could cause moderate to extensive damage, according to a study from FEMA, the USGS, and the California Geological Survey, which cites "both the movement of the population to higher risk areas on the West Coast and a change in hazard assessments," a study author explains in a press release. "We've always been told that we should be prepared. But this study puts some teeth into the recommendation," a seismologist says, per the AP. As the research avoided areas where oil and gas drilling has spawned small tremors, the number of people at risk could be even higher, a USGS researcher adds. The average annual cost of earthquakes in the Lower 48 is about $4.5 billion, with 80% of losses incurred in California, Oregon, and Washington. "While the West Coast may carry the larger burden of potential losses and the greatest threat from the strongest shaking, this report shows that the threat from earthquakes is widespread," the researcher says. The Rockies, Midwest, New England, and parts of the Southeast also face a higher risk. (And then there's Oklahoma.)
Summary: According to a recent study, the number of Americans living in earthquake zones has doubled in the past 20 years, with about half of the US population now at risk of experiencing damaging shaking, particularly in the West Coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington.
Story: – Kanye West's months-long campaign to get Kim Kardashian on the cover of Vogue has finally worked. Actually, both Kim and Kanye are featured on the April cover, shot by Annie Leibovitz. Baby North West even gets in on the action in the behind-the-scenes video of the shoot. But we have to take a bit of an issue with the hashtag Vogue chose to use on the cover: #worldsmosttalkedaboutcouple. Sure, if you say so, Vogue. Kim's reaction on Twitter was predictably over-the-top: "This is such a dream come true!!! Thank you @VogueMagazine for this cover! O M GGGGGG!!! I can't even breath [sic]!" In her editor's letter, Anna Wintour insists Kanye didn't force her into the cover decision, Hollywood Life reports. "The gossip might make better reading, but the simple fact of the matter is that it isn’t true," she writes. "He did nothing of the sort." Rather, the couple is cover-worthy because "there’s barely a strand of the modern media that the Kardashian Wests haven’t been able to master, and for good reason." But a Hollywood Life source begs to differ: "Anna would only do this if they were both on the cover. Kanye orchestrated the whole deal." And there are some pretty high-profile detractors of the cover: Sarah Michelle Gellar tweeted, "Well......I guess I'm canceling my Vogue subscription. Who is with me???"
Summary: Kanye West's months-long campaign to get Kim Kardashian on the cover of Vogue finally succeeded, with both Kim and Kanye featured on the April cover, shot by Annie Leibovitz, and Baby North West appearing in the behind-the-scenes video, despite some controversy over the hashtag used on the cover and reactions from the couple and Vogue editor Anna Wintour.
Story: – Herman Cain is happy to embrace at least one story about him that's emerged of late: his deep ties to conservative power brokers Charles and David Koch. "I'm proud to know the Koch brothers," Cain told their Americans for Prosperity group today, reports MSNBC. "I'm very proud to know the Koch brothers." Then he joked that he had a "breaking news announcement for the media: I am the Koch brothers' brother from another mother!" Koch made light of a New York Times article that described his and campaign chief Mark Block's relationship with the Kochs. But that type of scrutiny probably won't end soon: The watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed a related complaint with the FEC today. CREW says a nonprofit group founded by Block—Prosperity USA, which is affiliated with the Kochs' advocacy group—illegally provided $40,000 in expenses to help start the Cain campaign. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported the allegations earlier this week. The campaign has asked an outside attorney to investigate. Click to read how all these headlines are not hurting Cain in the polls.
Summary: Herman Cain is proud of his ties to conservative power brokers Charles and David Koch, despite recent scrutiny over a nonprofit group founded by his campaign chief providing $40,000 in expenses to help start the Cain campaign, which has led to a complaint filed with the FEC by a watchdog group.
Story: – A Florida mom allegedly tried to run down her daughter's husband with her Mercedes after he exposed their affair. The Palm Beach Post reports that Kathleen Regina Davis, 58, told cops she wanted her son-in-law dead after he wrecked her relationship with her daughter by copping to the affair. Palm Beach Gardens police found Davis driving in circles around Michael Sciarra's front yard just before 9pm last Wednesday, allegedly trying to hit him, reports WPBF. She nearly succeeded, the 33-year-old told cops. The assault allegedly began with Davis tossing eggs at his house and cars. CBS12 quotes Sciarra as saying he went outside to investigate the "banging" he heard and saw Davis hurling the eggs. He says he warned her he was going to call 911 and says that's when she got behind the wheel and came after him. Davis was arrested on a felony charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and released on $3,000 bail two days later. Though some reports say Sciarra and the daughter were dating, the Post says its records search shows that the two were married and are in the process of divorcing. (One of the best online comments ever involves an affair.)
Summary: A 58-year-old Florida woman, Kathleen Regina Davis, allegedly tried to run down her son-in-law with her Mercedes after he exposed her affair with her daughter, who is married to him, by throwing eggs at his house and cars, and nearly succeeded in hitting him.
Story: – A Toronto man has been found guilty in the 2012 murder of his father, a death that was originally ruled a suicide. Per the BBC, Dellen Millard told authorities his father, businessman Wayne Millard, suffered from alcoholism and depression as they investigated the death. After investigators concluded the gunshot wound that killed 71-year-old Millard was self-inflicted, the younger Millard was set to inherit millions from the family's aviation business. However, information provided to authorities by employees at MillardAir sparked a new investigation that would eventually change the suicide ruling to a homicide and lead to two more murder victims that police traced back to Dellen Millard. According to the Globe and Mail, investigators pinned Millard and a friend to the murder of Laura Babcock, a 24-year-old woman he'd been dating who was killed months before Wayne Millard. Unbelievably, Millard and the friend, Mark Smich, were soon also connected to the murder of 32-year-old Tim Bosma, which occurred months after the elder Millard was found dead. Millard and Smich were both convicted in the murders of Babcock and Bosma. They were already serving their time when Millard was found guilty in his father's death. Millard is due to be sentenced in this latest case Nov. 16.
Summary: A Toronto man, Dellen Millard, was found guilty of murdering his father, Wayne Millard, in 2012, after initially being ruled a suicide, and was also linked to the murders of three other people, including his girlfriend Laura Babcock and a man named Tim Bosma, through an investigation sparked by employees of his family's aviation business.
Story: – It's-a me, mobile Mario. Super Mario Run, Nintendo's first-ever stab at a smartphone game, was released Thursday for all iOS devices. A one-time app store purchase of $9.99 gets gamers six worlds, 24 levels, three game modes, and multiple playable characters. Here's what people are saying about Mario's newest adventure in the Mushroom Kingdom: While it's shocking to see Mario on a non-Nintendo device, Super Mario Run is "knock-your-socks-off good," Time reports. "Nothing else looks or plays like an authentic Mario escapade, and Super Mario Run feels like one for the ages." Kotaku agrees with that sentiment, noting that its cleverly designed levels and three game modes make it a "far cry from the standard mobile fare." "It's a full-featured Mario game that just happens to run on your phone." But the Verge found that Super Mario Run "feels like a compromised version of the classic game" because Nintendo went and messed with its tried-and-true formula, creating a constantly running Mario whom users can only make jump. Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto, the man who created Super Mario Bros. 31 years ago, gave Wired seven "surprising" facts about Super Mario Run, including that it started with a decade-old idea for the Wii. A research firm expects Super Mario Run to make $60 million in its first month—before it's even released for Android devices, GameSpot reports. Another analyst thinks it will "easily" reach 1 billion downloads, joining the ranks of the most popular mobile games ever. Speaking of Android, Nintendo isn't saying when fans without iPhones or iPads will get a shot at Super Mario Run, telling Polygon only that "information about that version will be revealed in the future." Finally, TechCrunch reports that Nintendo could have a "windfall" if it can successfully use Super Mario Run to introduce the character to a new generation of kids who may have never touched a traditional console but are glued to their phones' Angry Birds and Pokemon GO apps.
Summary: Super Mario Run, Nintendo's first mobile game, was released Thursday for iOS devices with a one-time app store purchase of $9.99, offering six worlds, 24 levels, and multiple playable characters, with some critics praising its authentic Mario feel and clever level design, while others feel it's compromised by the constant running mechanic and lack of traditional console experience.
Story: – It's well-known that men drink more than women—but a new analysis by a National Institutes of Health group finds that the gap between the way the two genders consume alcohol in the US is narrowing, according to an NIH press release. For example, the percentage of females who drank alcohol in the previous 30 days went from 44.9% in 2002 to 48.3% in 2012, while the percentage of males went from 57.4% to 56.1% during the same time period. Similarly, the average number of drinking days during the prior month went from 6.8 to 7.3 days for females, while going from 9.9 to 9.5 days for males. "Males still consume more alcohol, but the differences between men and women are diminishing," says the lead researcher. The analysis looked at data from annual national surveys from 2002 to 2012. Researchers looked at "lifetime abstinence, age of onset, current drinking, binge drinking, drinking and driving, reaching ... criteria for an alcohol use disorder, combining alcohol with other drugs such as marijuana, and other variables," and found that the gap between males and females narrowed, for all age groups or at least one age group, in all but one area: combining alcohol with pot "during the last drinking occasion." That behavior increased from 15% to 19% among males aged 18 to 25, but held steady at about 10% for females of the same age. Researchers aren't sure why women are drinking more like men—they controlled for "recent trends in employment, pregnancy, [and] marital status"—but they say more study is needed, because women are at a higher risk for many alcohol-related health implications. (Scientists have decided there are four kinds of drunks.)
Summary: According to a new analysis by the National Institutes of Health, the gap between men and women in the US in terms of alcohol consumption is narrowing, with females drinking more than in previous years and males drinking less, although men still consume more alcohol overall.
Story: – The world lost one country but gained two new ones yesterday as the Netherlands Antilles officially ceased to exist. People on the Caribbean islands of Curacao and St. Maarten woke to find themselves in autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Reuters reports. Three smaller islands that had been part of the Antilles will now be directly ruled by the Netherlands. The federation, formed in 1954, fell apart amid arguments over revenue and debt sharing, the AP notes. "We will have to get ourselves accustomed to the new reality," said Sarah Wescot-Williams, St. Maarten's first prime minister. "Yes, we are still part of the Dutch kingdom and, yes, we are bound by rules and agreements with kingdom partners, but the success of our fledgling country starts with all of us."
Summary: The Netherlands Antilles dissolved yesterday, with Curacao and St. Maarten gaining independence as autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while three smaller islands will be directly ruled by the Netherlands.
Story: – Backers of medical marijuana got a surprise victory a few weeks ago in the form of a study from the Rand Corp. Researchers concluded that after Los Angeles authorities shut down hundreds of dispensaries last year, crime actually increased around the closed facilities. The victory proved short-lived: Rand has pulled the controversial study for review after the LA city attorney and other officials demanded its retraction, reports the Los Angeles Times. “As we’ve begun to take a look at the report, we decided it’s best to remove it from circulation until that review is complete," said a spokesman. The city attorney had criticized the study—which compared crime stats in particular areas 10 days before the dispensaries shut down and 10 days after—as "highly suspect and unreliable."
Summary: A recent study by the Rand Corp. found that crime actually increased in areas where medical marijuana dispensaries were shut down in Los Angeles, despite initial claims of a victory for backers of the drug.
Story: – Social media was supposed to bring everyone closer together, but a former Facebook exec fears it's doing the exact opposite. "I feel tremendous guilt," Chamath Palihapitiya, who used to be the VP of user growth at the social network, said during an appearance in November at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, in a speech just now being widely shared, per the Verge. "I think we have created tools that are ripping apart the social fabric of how society works." Palihapitiya railed against the "short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops" where people spend their hours vying for "hearts, likes, thumbs-up," and he blamed "bad actors" for manipulating online information. There is "no civil discourse, no cooperation," simply "misinformation [and] mistruth," he noted, per the New York Post. He confessed he now rarely uses the network he helped grow—he's posted just a handful of times over the past seven years. "It's created huge tension with my friends, huge tensions in my social circles," he said. He added that in the back of the minds of all those involved in building Facebook, everyone knew "something bad could happen." Palihapitiya isn't completely sure how to take back control of Facebook, which he still said "overwhelmingly does positive good in the world," so he just tries to manage what he can. "I don't use this s---," he said. And "I can control my kids' decision, which is they're not allowed to use this s---." His suggestion for others after this "soul searching"? Take a "hard break" from social media. "If you feed the beast, the beast will destroy you," he said. The Post has a lightly edited transcript of his take.
Summary: Former Facebook VP Chamath Palihapitiya expressed guilt over his role in creating the platform, which he believes is tearing apart society's social fabric with short-term dopamine-driven feedback loops, misinformation, and manipulation, and has caused tension in his personal relationships.
Story: – The latest trophy hunter to spark the internet's rage is a Kentucky woman who posed for a photo with the giraffe she killed on a trip to South Africa. The South Africa-based AfricLand Post website tweeted the pictures earlier this month along with the message, "White american savage who is partly a neanderthal comes to Africa and shoot down a very rare black giraffe coutrsey [sic] of South Africa stupidity." The photos, which were taken during a hunting trip in June 2017, quickly went viral, with many (including actors Ricky Gervais and Debra Messing) sharing them on various social media sites; one Twitter user shared a screenshot of the original Facebook post by Tess Thompson Talley with the pictures, since deleted or made private. "Prayers for my once in a lifetime dream hunt came true today!" she said in the post, per USA Today. "Spotted this rare black giraffe bull and stalked him for quite awhile. ... He was over 18 years old, 4,000 lbs and was blessed to be able to get 2,000 lbs of meat." But a giraffe expert tells Yahoo! the type of giraffe shown is not rare and its numbers are actually increasing in the wild. Talley defended her kill with a statement to Fox News, saying that the giraffe "was the South African sub-species of giraffe" and that its numbers are "actually increasing due, in part, to hunters and conservation efforts paid for in large part by big game hunting." She added that the "breed is not rare in any way other than it was very old." She also said the giraffe was too old to breed, but had killed three younger males, calling what she did "conservation through game management."
Summary: A Kentucky woman, Tess Thompson Talley, sparked outrage after posing with the giraffe she killed during a hunting trip in South Africa, with critics accusing her of trophy hunting and ignoring the fact that the giraffe is not a rare species and its numbers are actually increasing in the wild.
Story: – For one gay teen, it didn't get better, and Lady Gaga plans to do something about it. The singer took to Twitter following the suicide of Jamey Rodemeyer—who ended his life because he could no longer face bullying at his school—first expressing sadness ("The past days I've spent reflecting, crying, and yelling. I have so much anger. It is hard to feel love when cruelty takes someones life") before establishing a platform of sorts. "Bullying must become be illegal. It is a hate crime,” she tweeted. And she plans on taking her case to the top. "I am meeting with our President. I will not stop fighting. This must end. Our generation has the power to end it. Trend it. #MakeALawForJamey." The Buffalo News notes that Rodemeyer posted Gaga lyrics on Facebook shortly before his death: "Don't forget me when I come crying to heaven's door."
Summary: Lady Gaga is taking action to make bullying a hate crime after a gay teenager, Jamey Rodemeyer, committed suicide due to bullying at his school, using her platform to advocate for legal action and meeting with the President to push for change.
Story: – The Secret Service agents involved in a crash at the White House last week didn't just add another embarrassing gaffe to the agency's loooong list. The stunt disrupted an active bomb investigation, the Washington Post reports. Sources and police documents note the allegedly intoxicated agents, identified by the Post as Mark Connolly and George Ogilvie, drove through police tape and "directly next to" a suspicious package a woman had left on the ground; she had claimed it was an "[expletive] bomb" before she hit an agent with her car as she drove away. (The package turned out to be a book wrapped in a shirt; the woman has been located.) New Secret Service chief Joe Clancy says he learned about the disturbed probe on Monday, five days after the March 4 incident, raising more concerns about the state of the troubled agency. Though the Homeland Security Department will investigate the crash, two members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee have asked Clancy to release more information on the "extremely serious" incident, which "raises important questions about what additional steps should be taken to reform the agency and whether the problems at the USSS run deeper than the recently replaced top-tier of management." Clancy has moved Connolly and Ogilvie to "non-supervisory, non-operational" positions—an odd move as agents under investigation are usually put on administrative leave. The Post points out this interesting tidbit: Ogilvie is a Secret Service spokesman who previously spoke on the agency's "zero-tolerance policy" for misconduct.
Summary: Two Secret Service agents involved in a crash at the White House were found to have driven through police tape and near a suspicious package, which turned out to be a book wrapped in a shirt, while intoxicated, and the incident has raised concerns about the state of the troubled agency.
Story: – The September jobs report is out today, delayed thanks to the government shutdown, and it reveals that the unemployment rate ticked down to 7.2% last month, while 148,000 jobs were added. Economists had expected the rate to hold steady at 7.3%, the Wall Street Journal notes, but they also expected more new jobs: 180,000, to be exact. The unemployment rate is a 5-year low, and Michael J. Casey at the Journal says it "seems genuine," rather than a result of people dropping out of the labor force. August's number was revised upward, from 169,000 new jobs to 193,000. But July's was revised downward, from 104,000 new jobs to 89,000—the fewest in more than a year. If you're looking for any effects the shutdown may have had on the economy, you'll likely have to wait for the October report, the Journal notes. And that one will also be delayed, by one week; it arrives on Nov. 8. But the AP notes that the number of jobs created in September suggests the market was already weakening in advance of the shutdown.
Summary: The September jobs report shows a decrease in unemployment rate to 7.2% with 148,000 new jobs added, despite economists' expectations of a higher number, and the revisions to previous months' numbers; any effects of the government shutdown on the economy will be delayed until the October report.
Story: – An operating room might sound like an inappropriate place to bust a move to Beyonce, but that's where Deborah Cohan decided to get down, minutes before her double mastectomy Tuesday. Cohan, an OB-GYN and mother of two, enlisted her medical team at the University of California-San Francisco Medical Center at Mount Zion to take part in a dance party before she went under the knife, the Huffington Post reports, and the result is a viral video that has viewers praising Cohan's strength, courage, and sense of humor. In a post on CaringBridge, Cohan explained, "I will be dancing in my little hospital gown and bouffant cap in the Mt. Zion operating room with the surgical and anesthesia teams. My fantasy is for you to play the song and dance wherever you happen to be." She asked friends and family to send her photos and videos of their dance moves for "a healing video montage," CNN notes. Why? "Nothing brings me greater joy than catalyzing others to dance, move, be in their bodies," Cohan wrote.
Summary: An OB-GYN and mother of two, Deborah Cohan, organized a dance party in her operating room minutes before undergoing a double mastectomy, with her medical team and friends and family participating, and the resulting viral video has been praised for her strength, courage, and sense of humor.
Story: – One odd thing not in dispute about global warming is that it's actually been paused for about 15 years now. Though a number of theories have been batted around, a new study thinks it's found the true culprit—the Atlantic Ocean has been absorbing heat that would normally be warming up surface temperatures, reports Reuters. "We found the missing heat," a researcher from the Ocean University of China says in Science. While this oceanic heat-trapping may not sound like a bad thing, the researchers present a downside: It's just a temporary cooling cycle, and when it ends in another decade or so, temperatures are expected to rise again quickly, reports the BBC. "We probably may have another 10 years, maybe shorter as global warming itself is melting more ice and ice could flood the North Atlantic, but historically we are in the middle of the cycle," he says. Researchers found a similar hiatus occurred between 1945 and 1975, just ahead of another spurt of rapid warming. A previous study actually blamed the Pacific Ocean, and while LiveScience says the new research won't settle the debate, "it does support the idea that Earth's global warming continues in the ocean, even when air temperatures stay flat." (Click for the details on that Pacific Ocean theory.)
Summary: A new study suggests that the Atlantic Ocean has been absorbing heat that would have otherwise contributed to global warming, causing a 15-year pause in temperature increases, but when the cycle ends, temperatures are expected to rise again quickly.
Story: – The Chuck Hagel drama continued on Capitol Hill today, as Republicans refused to allow a final vote on his confirmation to become defense secretary, reports the Hill. Hagel is expected to prevail eventually—but now it can't happen until lawmakers return from the Presidents' Day recess. Expect the next vote on Feb. 26, reports Politico. One of the sticking points is that Republicans want more information about Hagel's compensation for speeches he gave after leaving the Senate in 2008. “I think it’s appropriate to wait until we come back,” said John McCain. “I think there’s plenty of time to have any further questions answered and I intend to vote for cloture then.” Harry Reid needed 60 votes to force an up-or-down vote today, but he came up with only 58. The White House, noting earlier that Hagel would miss a NATO meeting in Brussels next week, called the GOP tactics "unconscionable." The move marks the first time a nominee for defense secretary has faced a filibuster, reports the Washington Post.
Summary: Republicans in the Senate refused to allow a final vote on Chuck Hagel's confirmation as defense secretary, demanding more information on his post-Senate speech compensation, delaying a vote until after the Presidents Day recess on February 26.
Story: – Samsung unveiled a slate of new products today, including some that (gasp!) don't run on Android. The electronics company showed off a new line of Windows 8-based products, including a 10.1-inch tablet and a 4.8-inch smartphone, the Wall Street Journal reports. "It's highly likely that Samsung will seek to reduce its dependence on Google," one analyst explained—though others pointed out that Windows phones haven't exactly been flying off the shelves for Nokia. The new phone has some pretty impressive specs, boasting a 4.8-inch HD Super AMOLED screen, 1.5Ghz dual-core processor, 1GB RAM, 16 or 32GB of storage, and a battery even bigger than the Galaxy S III's, Gizmodo reports. But the design, they add, is merely decent. "It's not as sleek and good-looking as the Galaxy S III. … Nokia's definitely got some competition, which is a good thing, but it would be even better if this thing were just drop dead gorgeous."
Summary: Samsung unveiled new Windows-based products, including a 10.1-inch tablet and 4.8-inch smartphone, as it seeks to reduce its dependence on Android and compete with Nokia in the Windows phone market.
Story: – China promised years ago to reform its legal system so suspects wouldn't be abused in custody, but according to a Human Rights Watch report out today authorities are flouting the rules and continuing their brutal methods, the AP reports. "Police are torturing criminal suspects to get them to confess to crimes, and courts are convicting people who confessed under torture," the HRW report says, per Reuters. The ominous 145-page "Tiger Chairs and Cell Bosses" was based on interviews with 48 ex-detainees (mostly accused of theft, selling drugs, or robbery), their families, lawyers, judges, and at least one former cop, Al Jazeera notes. The allegations are horrific: beatings, electrocution with batons, sleep and water deprivation, even spraying suspects "with chili oil in sensitive areas," the Guardian notes. "They handcuffed me and then hung the handcuffs on the windows," says a former detainee who spoke with HRW, per Reuters. "I was hung like a dog." China has notoriously used torture to elicit confessions, and legal reforms (the Criminal Procedure Law was most recently revamped in 2012) mandate that all suspect interviews be taped and ban evidence obtained through torture, Al Jazeera notes; the country's public security minister said in 2013 that coerced confessions plummeted 87% in 2012 from 2011. But HRW tells Al Jazeera it can't confirm that stat and adds that the report may not even cover the worst of it. "We have to take into account that the torture of political criminal suspects often is worse, and the report doesn't cover Tibet and Xinjiang," a human rights researcher tells Reuters. (China promised to stop using organs from executed prisoners last year.)
Summary: According to a Human Rights Watch report, Chinese authorities are continuing to torture and abuse criminal suspects in custody despite promises of legal reforms to prevent such abuses, with methods including beatings, electrocution, sleep and water deprivation, and spraying with chili oil.
Story: – NASA launched another spacecraft toward Mars on Saturday, and this one is designed to provide an unprecedented look at the planet's interior. You can watch the liftoff the InSight lander, a 790-pound probe, here. The spacecraft won't reach Mars until November, but when it does, it will fill in important gaps in knowledge, mission official Bruce Banerdt tells CNN. Previous missions have explored the planet's atmosphere and surface, "but until now, the vast regions of the planet deeper than a few miles, or so, (have) been almost completely unknown to us." InSight will change that. The lander will dig deeper into Mars than ever before—nearly 16 feet—to take the planet's temperature, per the AP. It will also attempt to make the first measurements of "marsquakes," using a seismometer placed directly on the Martian surface. The Atlas V rocket holds a pair of mini satellites meant to trail InSight all the way to Mars in a first-of-its-kind technology demonstration. Another first: This is the first mission to another planet that launched from the West Coast, instead of from Florida's Kennedy Space Center.
Summary: NASA launched the InSight lander towards Mars on Saturday, which will provide an unprecedented look at the planet's interior by digging nearly 16 feet deep and measuring "marsquakes" using a seismometer placed directly on the Martian surface.
Story: – What is it with New England universities? Just days after news broke that a sex assault accusation may have scuttled a Yale quarterback's chance at a Rhodes Scholarship comes word of a "joke" rape video aired on the University of Connecticut's student broadcast network. The "comedy sketch," part of UCTV's "Shenanigans" series, reveals a crying female—called a "stinky bitch"—who is "crying rape." The sketch ends with the character being strangled by her attacker. The short was aired twice, but scrubbed after howls of protest, and UCTV administrators apologized. The campus Women's Center held a protest last night. Gawker has the film here.
Summary: A University of Connecticut student broadcast network aired a controversial "joke" rape video that sparked protests and apologies after it depicted a crying female character being called a "stinky bitch" and strangled by an attacker, highlighting the ongoing issue of sexual assault on college campuses.
Story: – Michigan State University had knowledge of a videotape showing Larry Nassar raping a 17-year-old field hockey player some 25 years before his downfall, according to a new lawsuit. The federal suit filed Monday on behalf of several plaintiffs specifically describes Erika Davis visiting the MSU sports doctor for help with a knee injury in 1992, reports ESPN. Nasser fondled and licked the virgin's breasts during an initial examination, videotaped by another man, then raped her on camera during a "full exam" a week later with use of a drug that made her "woozy," the suit states, per NBC News. It adds Davis went to her coach, who received the video from Nassar but was forced to return it, resign, and sign a nondisclosure agreement by athletic director George Perles, now a MSU trustee. Davis, who became pregnant and suffered a miscarriage, lost a scholarship after pressing university police to take up the case, the suit claims. Seeking more than $75,000 for each plaintiff involved in allegations against Nassar, MSU, its board of trustees, USA Gymnastics, and others, the suit claims Davis was told "George Perles is a 'powerful man,' and she should just drop it," per the Lansing State Journal. Apologizing for Nassar's overall behavior, MSU said Tuesday it's "taking the allegations very seriously and looking into the situation." Perles, however, has remained quiet since apologizing to abuse victims in January. "We're awful sorry for the trouble we've caused those poor women. And we will make sure to do everything in our power to make sure it doesn't happen again," he said, per WOOD.
Summary: In 1992, MSU athletic director George Perles forced a coach to return a videotape of Larry Nassar raping a 17-year-old field hockey player after the coach reported the incident, according to a new lawsuit filed on behalf of several plaintiffs.
Story: – The slave trade was actually the "Atlantic triangular trade," and capitalism is always "free enterprise" under textbook changes to be voted on as early as today in Texas. The Board of Education, putting the final touches on the new guidelines yesterday, finally agreed to add the current president's name tO history textbooks rather than simply referring to the election of the first black president. But which version of his name sparked contentious debate—one GOP board member insisted on Barack Hussein Obama. "I think we give him the full honor and privilege of his full name," the board member averred. But under duress he agreed to drop the middle name, the AP reports. "To put an end to the whining I withdraw the motion," he said. The new guidelines will also require exploration of "unintended consequences" of programs like Title IX and the Great Society, and students will learn about the Moral Majority and anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly, notes the Christian Science Monitor.
Summary: The Texas Board of Education has approved new guidelines for history textbooks that include the name of President Barack Obama and require the exploration of "unintended consequences" of various programs, such as Title IX and the Great Society, as well as the inclusion of Phyllis Schlafly and the Moral Majority.
Story: – Teams Obama and Romney will likely be biting their nails come 8:29am tomorrow, as the first of the three remaining pre-election jobs reports are issued. With less than 24 hours to go, some hints of what may come: In what the AP calls an "encouraging sign," a private survey out today shows businesses ramped up hiring in August. Though private-sector jobs were predicted to jump 145,000 last month, the ADP survey noted an increase of 201,000 jobs. But don't get too excited. The Wall Street Journal offers a sobering reminder that ADP has had some huge swings-and-misses lately. It estimated a 176,000-job jump in June; the actual private-sector gain was just 84,000. As such, the Journal doubts projections will change. And what are those projections? An unemployment rate still stuck at 8.3%, and the addition of 125,000 new jobs, per economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. (The AP puts the forecast at 135,000 jobs, same rate.) In other jobless numbers, 12,000 fewer Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, a possible indication of a job market on the upswing. The four-week average stands at 371,250; a number consistently below 375,000 suggests hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate, explains the AP, though it predicts this most recent data won't affect the August report. Click for one take on why tomorrow's numbers have an unmatched political significance.
Summary: The latest private survey shows a surprise increase of 201,000 jobs in August, but previous errors by ADP have raised doubts about the accuracy of the projections, which forecast an unemployment rate of 8.3% and the addition of 125,000 new jobs.
Story: – Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Lt. Gov. Tina Smith on Wednesday to replace Sen. Al Franken until a special election in November, setting up his longtime and trusted adviser for a potentially bruising 2018 election, per the AP. Smith was widely seen as Dayton's top choice from the moment Franken announced his resignation last week, and she confirmed Wednesday that she plans to run in the November special election to complete Franken's term through 2020. It's not clear when Smith will head to Washington. Franken, who resigned under pressure from his own party after he was accused of improper behavior by at least eight women, announced last Thursday that he would resign "in the coming weeks." His office said Tuesday that he had not yet set a final departure date. The appointment won't change the balance of power in the Senate—both Franken and Smith are Democrats. Smith, 59, served as Dayton's trusted chief of staff for four years before ascending to become his No. 2 when he needed a running mate in 2014. Dayton has long treated her as an equal in the office, and it was that deference that fueled speculation she was being groomed to succeed him. Smith, a native of New Mexico, graduated from Stanford and earned an MBA from Dartmouth. A marketing job with General Mills brought her to Minnesota, where she eventually started her own marketing and political consulting firm. (She'll be joining fellow Democrat Doug Jones in the chamber.)
Summary: Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton appointed Lt. Governor Tina Smith to replace Senator Al Franken until a special election in November, with Smith planning to run in the election to complete Franken's term through 2020.
Story: – After celebrating House Republicans' verdict of no collusion between President Trump's campaign and Russia, officials at the Russian Embassy in Washington set about comparing investigations of "Russian meddling" to a search for UFOs. The embassy's Twitter account shared two overlapping photos Monday: one showing a helicopter in the sky with its search light on, the other showing the roof of the embassy building awash in light. "What was American helicopter searching for at the Russian Embassy's premises yesterday night?" the tweet read, per Sputnik. "'Strange' malfunction of navigation equipment in the center of the US capital? Or another desperate attempt to find traces of #RussianMeddling?" As if to point out the unbelievability of meddling in the 2016 election, the tweet finished with a UFO emoji. While it might've been simple trolling—a Secret Service rep said he was unaware of any incident with a helicopter—the Washington Post reports DC police did dispatch a helicopter after 10pm Sunday while investigating a possible armed robbery. According to an officer, the helicopter scanned an area half a mile north of the embassy's entrance for about 20 minutes. Regardless of its complaint, the Russian Embassy doesn't actually seem that concerned with what a helicopter might've been doing nearby. An earlier tweet Monday said all investigations of Russian interference in the election would end just like the House probe, and quoted Texas Rep. Mike Conaway, a Republican, as saying, "only Tom Clancy could take this series of inadvertent contacts, meetings, whatever, and weave that into some sort of a spy thriller that could go out there."
Summary: Russian Embassy in Washington compares investigation of "Russian meddling" to search for UFOs after a helicopter was spotted near the embassy, with the embassy tweeting about a possible malfunction or attempt to find traces of meddling, despite the embassy's lack of concern.
Story: – Mike Ditka suffered a "very minor stroke" yesterday and ended up in the hospital, he tells the Chicago Tribune. "I feel good right now and it's not a big deal," says the 73-year-old. Still, he won't be working for ESPN this NFL weekend, according to a tweet from a network producer confirming the news. The former Bears coach says he was playing cards with friends when he realized his hands and his speech weren't quite right. Ditka had a heart attack in the midst of the 1988 season, notes the AP, though he quickly recovered.
Summary: Former NFL coach Mike Ditka suffered a minor stroke and is currently in the hospital, despite feeling well and not expecting it to be a "big deal," but he will not be working for ESPN this NFL weekend due to the incident.
Story: – President Trump issued one more provocative threat to North Korea Friday morning: "Military solutions are now fully in place,locked and loaded,should North Korea act unwisely," he tweeted. "Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!" The tweet comes after a Chinese newspaper warned both countries to avoid a pre-emptive strike on the other. It also follows Trump's meeting with national security officials on Thursday and a doubling down on his earlier "fire and fury" warning. Friday's tweet, then, marks the president's third threat this week to strike North Korea, notes the New York Times, though the newspaper adds that no signs on the ground point to "imminent action." North Korea, however, has said it is working on a plan to land missiles near the US territory of Guam. About an hour before Trump's tweet, state media in Pyongyang complained that Trump is "driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a nuclear war," reports the Wall Street Journal. A separate article warned that even a "single shell" dropped by the US could lead to "thermonuclear war."
Summary: President Trump threatened North Korea with "military solutions" and a potential pre-emptive strike, hours after a Chinese newspaper warned both countries to avoid such action, amidst a series of escalating threats and warnings this week.
Story: – A story published by Glenn Greenwald's Intercept, which has published the leaks of none other than Edward Snowden, contains information from national security documents dating back to August 2013—after Snowden fled the US, and thus an indication that there's a new leaker in town. The newly leaked documents are labeled "Secret" and "NOFORN," meaning no sharing with foreign governments, both of which are lower clearance levels than the "Top Secret" docs Snowden accessed, reports CNN. One Government Accountability Office study has found that more than 3.2 million people were approved in recent years to access "Secret" and higher clearance docs. Said Greenwald himself last month: "I have no doubt there will be other sources inside the government who see extreme wrongdoing who are inspired by Edward Snowden." The Intercept's main takeaway is that the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) has grown to more than a million names, nearly double its level when the underwear bomber tried to blow up a plane on Christmas 2009. Other revelations include, as per the New York Times: 3,258 people are "known or suspected terrorists" in the war in Syria, including 41 Americans; 50,466 people are linked to al-Qaeda; 62,794 to the Taliban; 21,199 to Hezbollah; 21,913 to Hamas; and 280,000 names on the list have no listed affiliation with a terrorist group. The no-fly list holds 47,000 names, 800 of which are Americans. (Snowden is now claiming that the NSA shares some pretty intimate pics of people under surveillance.)
Summary: A new leaker has been revealed in a recent Intercept publication of leaked national security documents, including "Secret" and "NOFORN" files, which have been approved for access by over 3.2 million people, and the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) has grown to over a million names, with new revelations on terrorist affiliations and the no-fly list.
Story: – Police are looking for the vandal who defaced a sand sculpture of Justin Bieber at the New York State Fair, reports the AP. State police tell the Syracuse Post-Standard that the sculpture apparently was vandalized Thursday night; cops say they have a partial description of the perp. Bieber's likeness was part of a 200-ton sand sculpture depicting artists who performed at the fair's old grandstand, which was imploded in January. Bieber's face appeared near the base of the sculpture. He was below the Charlie Daniels Band and singer Charley Pride and to the left of actor Steve Martin. The fair runs through Monday in Geddes, near Syracuse.
Summary: Police are searching for a vandal who defaced a 200-ton sand sculpture of Justin Bieber at the New York State Fair, which was part of a larger sculpture depicting famous performers at the fair's old grandstand.
Story: – Megyn Kelly's new book has been getting the Amy Schumer treatment on Amazon since its release last week, with critics leaving one-star reviews along with comments such as "put some clothes on." Now Amazon has apparently stepped in. Publisher Harper Collins says it alerted Amazon to reviews of the Fox anchor's book that had "the hallmarks of an orchestrated effort to discredit the book," reports the Los Angeles Times. Since then, some "politically motivated negative reviews" have disappeared from the site, reports USA Today. At one point, 76% of reviews gave Settle for More one star, reports Slate. As of about 1:30pm Eastern Wednesday, 42% of 406 Amazon reviews give the book one star, while 45% give it five stars. The numbers were changing quickly—with the total number of reviews bouncing up and down along with the percentages. The LA Times notes that many one-star reviews appeared to come from a pro-Trump Reddit forum where a post linking to Kelly's book on Amazon read, "It would be a shame if her biased reporting was reflected in the customer reviews!" (Kelly and Trump were at odds during the election.) The same forum launched a similar attack against Hillary Clinton's Hard Choices. But several Amazon reviewers have complained that their legitimate reviews have disappeared, while one-star reviews in which users admit to never opening Kelly's book remain.
Summary: Amazon has removed politically motivated negative reviews of Megyn Kelly's book "Settle for More" after identifying them as an orchestrated effort to discredit the book, with some reviewers admitting they never even read the book.
Story: – A man and woman have been charged in a disturbing case out of Columbus, Ohio, in which police say a teen was raped while her friend streamed the assault on live-video app Periscope. Authorities say 18-year-old Marina Lonina and the 17-year-old victim were drinking with 29-year-old Raymond Gates inside a home when he raped the teen, whose ability "to resist or consent was substantially impaired," an indictment reads, per the Columbus Dispatch. The BBC identifies Gates as Lonina's boyfriend. Police say a friend of Lonina's living out of state contacted police when she saw the images. On Wednesday, a Franklin County grand jury indicted Gates and Lonina on charges of kidnapping, sexual battery, rape, and pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor. The rape charge indicates intercourse by force and is not related to the victim's age, a prosecutor tells the AP. "If Gates and Lonina are convicted for these charges, they each face a potential sentence in excess of 40 years in prison," he says. "It isn't a human reaction to record something like that," says a parent at New Albany High School, where Lonina was arrested on Wednesday, per 10TV. "It's vile." A lawyer for Lonina says she "categorically denies these charges."
Summary: A 17-year-old girl was raped by her friend's boyfriend, 29-year-old Raymond Gates, while the assault was streamed live on Periscope, and both the perpetrator and the victim's friend, 18-year-old Marina Lonina, have been charged with various crimes including kidnapping, sexual battery, and pandering sexually oriented matter involving a minor.
Story: – Sheila Lyon, 12, and her 10-year-old sister, Katherine, disappeared almost 40 years ago while walking to a shopping mall near their Maryland home. The case went cold until earlier this year, when a former carnival worker, Lloyd Lee Welch, was named a person of interest in their 1975 disappearance—and now police are searching a Virginia property once owned by Welch's aunt and uncle in the hopes of finding clues about the girls, who were never found, My Fox DC reports. Welch "has criminal convictions involving young female victims in the states of Virginia, Delaware, and South Carolina," according to the Montgomery County police chief, and detectives have been tracking his movements before he was imprisoned in 1997. A resident of Thaxton, Va., where police are currently searching, tells My Fox DC her father recalls Welch and "thought maybe he wasn't right in the head." What exactly spurred police to start scouring the Thaxton property is unknown. They're focusing on an area "where the old cemetery [in the woods] is," the resident says. "You can't see it from the road." Welch, who was denied early release last month in Delaware, has a release date of June 2026, the Washington Post reports.
Summary: Police are searching a property in Virginia where a former carnival worker, Lloyd Lee Welch, was raised and has a history of criminal convictions involving young female victims, in connection with the 1975 disappearance of two sisters, Sheila Lyon and Katherine, who were last seen walking to a shopping mall near their Maryland home.
Story: – Suspiciously high radiation levels around the Austrian town of St. Georgen an der Gusen had long fueled theories that there was a buried bunker nearby where Nazis had tested nuclear weapons during WWII. Those suspicions came one step closer to being confirmed last week after the opening of a 75-acre underground complex was dug out from below the earth and granite used to seal off the entrance, the Times of Israel reports. The excavation team was led by Austrian filmmaker Andreas Sulzer, who says the site was "likely the biggest secret weapons production facility of the Third Reich"—a facility that probably relied on forced labor from the nearby Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp and may have even been the testing location for a nuclear bomb, the Daily Mirror reports. The weapons facility was believed to have been manned by SS General Hans Kammler and situated near the B8 Bergkristall factory, where the first working jet-powered fighter was created, International Business Times reports; Sulzer first got wind of the site after seeing references to it in an Austrian physicist's diary. "Up to 320,000 inmates are said to have died because of the brutal conditions in the subterranean labyrinth," Sulzer tells the Sunday Times, per the Times of Israel. Those inmates were chosen for skills in physics, chemistry, or other sciences that would advance the Nazis' quest for WMD, Sulzer says. Digging at the site was halted by local officials who demanded a permit, but Sulzer says excavation will restart next month. "We owe it to the victims to finally open the site and reveal the truth," he says, per the Mirror. (The US is still keeping nuclear warheads around to fight … asteroids?)
Summary: An underground complex believed to be a secret Nazi weapons facility, possibly for nuclear bomb testing, was discovered in Austria, with evidence of forced labor from a nearby concentration camp and potential connections to SS General Hans Kammler and the B8 Bergkristall factory, where the first jet-powered fighter was developed.
Story: – It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt—or threatened with bodily harm. Stephen Hanks, the 47-year-old who said some nasty things to Bristol Palin regarding her momma (an exchange that was, of course, caught on film), has now apologized. Though he originally said he'd gladly do it again, Hanks has backtracked after threats were made against him, his family, and his dog, explains Hanks' lawyer. In a statement released to E! News, Hanks says, "I have come to the conclusion that no matter what my feelings are towards Sarah Palin, I should not have expressed them towards her daughter, Bristol Palin." He continues: "My political views are solely mine, and not those of my friends, colleagues, or the establishment for which I work. I apologize to them for my poor judgment that night, and to Bristol for any hurt my actions may have caused her. I wish Bristol success with her television show, and much happiness in the future." As for that TV show? In the statement, Hanks also notes that the exchange wasn't staged, and that he didn't even realize it was being filmed. (E! calls BS on that, considering a camera crew was with her the whole time she was in the bar.) Click to watch to controversial scene.
Summary: Stephen Hanks apologized for making hurtful comments to Bristol Palin after receiving threats against himself, his family, and his dog, despite initially saying he would do it again.
Story: – A 51-year-old math tutor in Houston is facing criminal charges stemming from his alleged sexual relationship with a 17-year-old high school student. But it's not the physical contact that has Aldo Leiva looking at up to 20 years in prison. At issue are the topless images that police say the student sent to Leiva at his urging, according to Courthouse News Service. In Texas, the age of consent is 17. However, the Houston Chronicle reports, "different laws that govern explicit photographs mean Leiva is facing up to 20 years in prison for lewd photos that the two exchanged with their smartphones." "We entrust our educators with the care of all children, and that includes 17-year-olds," says an assistant district attorney. A state district judge on Tuesday signed an order barring Leiva from contacting the girl. But his attorney tells the Chronicle that he would seek to have that reversed. "She's indicated to me that she wants to continue to have contact with him," the attorney says. The relationship was discovered when the teen's mother found images of her daughter kissing an older man on a cellphone, according to charging documents. A school district police officer says the teen told him she began dating Leiva in 2015 and confirmed sexual contact between the two. Leiva reportedly claimed to be the girl's "mentor/teacher/friend/listener." Phone records show that the couple had lewd text conversations. (In one, Leiva, who called himself Batman and his penis Robin, writes, "I want to poke you with my Robin.") Also, at least three pictures on Leiva's phone depict the teen in various states of undress. (This teacher allegedly had sex with her 13-year-old student daily for nine months.)
Summary: A 51-year-old math tutor in Houston is facing up to 20 years in prison for exchanging topless images with a 17-year-old student he was mentoring, despite the age of consent in Texas being 17, as different laws governing explicit photographs are in place.
Story: – Democrats led by Dianne Feinstein unveiled new legislation to rein in assault weapons today, reports the Washington Post. A few key points: It would ban 157 types of semiautomatic weapons, including the Bushmaster variety used in the Sandy Hook rampage. It would ban ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. Current owners of such weapons can keep them, but if they sell them, the prospective buyer must undergo a criminal background check. The legislation would be permanent, unlike the 1994 ban that expired 10 years later. This year's bill is more comprehensive than the old one. The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 faces an "uphill road" to passage, acknowledged Feinstein, who added that the goal is to "dry up the supply of these weapons over time," reports the New York Times. And the Los Angeles Times illustrates just how uphill that road will be: It notes high in its coverage that when Feinstein started her news conference, "no Republican lawmaker was there. Nor was a red-state Democrat."
Summary: Democrats led by Dianne Feinstein have introduced new legislation to ban 157 types of semiautomatic weapons, including the Bushmaster used in the Sandy Hook rampage, and would require background checks for prospective buyers of these weapons, with the goal of gradually reducing their supply.
Story: – Kate Kelly wants women to be allowed to become Mormon priests. John P. Dehlin simply wants Mormons to be more accepting of gay members. Now both are facing excommunication from the church for apostasy, the New York Times reports. They were notified of the move on consecutive days this week, so they suspect officials at the church's Salt Lake City headquarters are behind the decision (though the church denies that), but both received notice from local officials. The president of Dehlin's stake, or church region, in Utah asked him to resign or face a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday, while Kelly's local bishop in Virginia told her she faces a disciplinary hearing on June 22. She had previously been warned by her stake president that she would face excommunication if she did not shut down her Ordain Women movement. Kelly founded the movement last year, and at its last demonstration, 500 demonstrators protested a male-only priesthood meeting carrying "proxy cards" representing 400 more supporters who couldn't be there. As for Dehlin, he founded Mormon Stories, a website and series of podcasts that address controversial issues and "hard questions" some members face, he says; he's also published research into issues gay Mormons face and has given a TED talk on being an "ally" to gay Mormons. He calls what he's going through "heart-wrenching" in a message on his site. Kelly agrees—"I’m just really, really, really heartbroken," she says—as do others: The news "is breaking a lot of hearts among the Mormon people," another prominent Mormon tells the Salt Lake Tribune. These are the most high-profile excommunication proceedings since 1993, the AP notes, when the church kicked out five members who questioned doctrine.
Summary: Kate Kelly and John Dehlin, two high-profile Mormons facing excommunication for advocating for women's ordination and LGBTQ+ rights, were notified of the decision by local church officials, despite the church denying any involvement.
Story: – Amazon held a massive nationwide job fair Wednesday, which is a good thing since retail companies are blaming the internet giant for forcing them to close thousands of stores and lay off employees. On its first-ever Jobs Day, Amazon aimed to hire 50,000 workers to fill positions at 12 warehouses in a single four-hour period, NBC News reports. According to Fortune, thousands of hopeful applicants lined up outside Amazon warehouses in New York, Maryland, Tennessee, Ohio, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and more with the hopes of being offered a job on the spot. Some complained about the pay at their current jobs, while others touted the benefits package available to Amazon's warehouse workers. Amazon was hiring for positions that pay between $11.50 and $13.75 an hour. But not everyone was excited about Jobs Day. Mashable calls it "corporate propaganda" and "bleak as hell." Yes, Amazon is offering decent jobs, but there was no reason to force applicants to get up at the crack of dawn to stand in line for hours just so Amazon could hire 50,000 people in a single day. No reason, that is, except good press—a chance for the company to show off its power in a positive light. "On Jobs Day, Amazon is delivering feels," Mashable states.
Summary: Amazon held a nationwide job fair on Wednesday, aiming to hire 50,000 workers at 12 warehouses in a four-hour period, with some applicants lining up early to take advantage of the opportunity despite criticism from some quarters that the event was little more than "corporate propaganda."
Story: – Police in Ohio have arrested three men suspected of being involved in attacks that left several members of the Amish community beardless. The men are part of a renegade Amish sect led by apparent revenge-seeking bishop Sam Mullet, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. Two of Mullet's sons were among those arrested in connection with the attacks, in which groups of men wielding scissors and electric clippers allegedly forced their way into victims' homes to clip off their beards and hair. Members of other Amish groups describe Mullet's 18 family-strong group as a cult, a description the bishop firmly rejects. He denies ordering the beard-cuttings, but says he should be allowed to punish people as he chooses. "You have your laws on the road and the town—somebody doesn't obey them, you punish them. But I'm not allowed to punish the church people?" he tells AP. "I just let them run over me? If every family would just do as they pleased, what kind of church would we have?"
Summary: Three men, including two sons of a renegade Amish bishop, were arrested in Ohio for attacking members of the Amish community and cutting off their beards and hair, with the bishop denying any involvement but arguing that he should have the right to punish church members as he sees fit.
Story: – The 27-year-old woman killed while jogging Sunday in Massachusetts may have fought back against her killer. "We believe that there was struggle between Vanessa and her killer that may have resulted in her killer receiving injuries," Mass Live quotes district attorney Joseph Early as saying Thursday. Those injuries include bruises, scratches, and scrapes, ABC News reports. Anyone who's seen a man with similar injuries in the area around Princeton, Massachusetts, is asked to call authorities. New York resident Vanessa Marcotte disappeared after going jogging Sunday near her mother's Princeton home. Her naked and burned body was found in a wooded area less than half a mile away that night. Early says authorities have "made some progress" in the hunt for Marcotte's killer but did not elaborate. Police have so far received more than 300 tips following her death, the Boston Globe reports. Authorities are currently investigating whether Marcotte was sexually assaulted before being killed—the first murder in Princeton in 30 years. (Another New York woman was also killed while jogging last week, and her mother had choice words for the still-at-large killer.)
Summary: A 27-year-old woman who was killed while jogging in Massachusetts may have fought back against her killer, resulting in injuries to the attacker, according to the district attorney.
Story: – A former Portsmouth, Va., police officer was found guilty of manslaughter Thursday after shooting an unarmed black teen last year—the second fatal shooting of his career. Though Stephen Rankin was charged with first-degree murder, a jury convicted him of the lesser charge and recommended he spend two and a half years in prison, reports the Guardian. He faced up to 10. Prosecutors said Rankin, 36, intentionally killed 18-year-old shoplifting suspect William Chapman in a Walmart parking lot on April 22, 2015, after Chapman resisted arrest. However, Rankin—a US Navy veteran with training in mixed martial arts—said he shot Chapman twice in self-defense as Chapman "came towards me aggressively" after a Taser was knocked from Rankin's hand as the two scuffled. "I felt I needed to save my life," he said, adding he immediately gave Chapman CPR. The Guardian reports Rankin also shot and killed an unarmed man from Kazakhstan in 2011, though Judge Johnny Morrison ruled jurors couldn't hear about that since a grand jury declined to indict Rankin. In that case, Rankin said 26-year-old Kirill Denyakin, shot 11 times, reached into his waistband and charged at him. Prosecutors also couldn't share with the jury text messages Rankin sent before Chapman's death; one read "people are just bad," another referenced Sodom and Gomorrah. It's not clear whether Chapman actually stole something from Walmart. Rankin is due to be sentenced Oct. 12, though his lawyers plan to appeal. The Virginian-Pilot reports he's the 13th US officer to have a jury convict him of murder or manslaughter since 2005.
Summary: A former Portsmouth, Virginia police officer, Stephen Rankin, was found guilty of manslaughter for shooting and killing an unarmed black teenager, William Chapman, during a struggle in a Walmart parking lot, with the jury recommending a prison sentence of two and a half years.
Story: – Scores of girls and young women have managed to escape from Boko Haram militants, Nigerian authorities say—though more than 200 schoolgirls seized in April are still missing. The 63 who managed to escape were among 68 people kidnapped last month when the Islamist radicals invaded a village, slaughtering the men and burning it to the ground, CNN reports. Officials say the women escaped when militants left to attack a military base, reports the BBC. "They took the bold step when their abductors moved out to carry out an operation," says a member of a vigilante group. The raid on the military base was repelled and the Nigerian military says it killed 53 Boko Haram fighters, with the loss of five soldiers and a senior military officer. A security source tells Reuters that the militants attacked the base with rocket-propelled grenades as retaliation for recent ground and air raids that have killed dozens of Boko Haram members. With no sign of the missing schoolgirls for months, international attention has waned, but analysts warn that the Boko Haram threat remains, and the militant group is now sharing information and tactics with other extremist groups, including Somalia's al-Shabab, NBC finds. Last week, Nigerian officials said they had arrested a businessman linked to the schoolgirl mass kidnapping.
Summary: Boko Haram militants kidnapped 68 people, including 200 schoolgirls, in a recent raid, but 63 of them managed to escape when their abductors left to attack a military base, with the Nigerian military repelling the attack and killing 53 militants, while a senior military officer and five soldiers were killed.
Story: – A 13-year-old boy in Santa Rosa, California, is dead after deputies mistook the replica assault rifle he was carrying for the real thing, reports the AP. Two deputies encountered Andy Lopez walking yesterday afternoon with what looked like an AK-47, reports the local Press Democrat. Police say they repeatedly ordered the youth to drop the weapon and opened fire when he didn't do so. It was only after the teen was fatally shot that deputies learned the assault rifle was a replica, as was the plastic handgun in his waistband. The shooting is under investigation.
Summary: A 13-year-old boy in Santa Rosa, California was fatally shot by deputies after they mistook a replica assault rifle he was carrying for the real thing, despite repeated orders to drop the weapon and realizing their mistake only after the teen was shot.
Story: – Black lung was thought to be on its way out following new mining regulations in 1969—but the disease is resurging and has some health experts using the word "epidemic," according to an NPR/Center for Public Integrity investigation. Its occurrence has doubled over the past 10 years, and in one section of Appalachia covering parts of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia, cases of the disease's final stage have quadrupled. "It feels like I've got a heavy wet sack on each lung," says a victim of the breath-stealing disease. The 1969 regulations initially cut cases by 90%, leading many to believe it was on a path to extinction. But though mining firms and regulators have been aware of miners' overexposure to disease-producing coal mine dust over the past 20 years, they have "failed to protect" their workers, reports NPR. Among the more damning facts and stats: Autopsies on 24 of the miners killed in the 2010 Big Branch mine blast showed that 71% had signs of the disease. Some victims have developed the disease after a relatively short period in the mines, it's advancing to worse stages more quickly, and it's affecting younger miners—in their 40s, 30s, and even 20s. This could be due in part to more exposure: In the last three decades, the workweek has gotten 11 hours longer, translating into 600 extra hours in the mines annually. Mining machines are more efficient these days, meaning, says a pulmonologist who works with miners, "they release more silicon dioxide, and the increase in silica is more toxic than just the coal dust itself." Click through for the full piece.
Summary: New mining regulations implemented in 1969 significantly reduced cases of black lung disease, but a recent NPR/Center for Public Integrity investigation has found that the disease is resurging, with cases doubling over the past 10 years and the final stage of the disease quadrupling in one Appalachian region, with miners reporting symptoms such as a heavy, wet sack on their lungs.
Story: – When an Australian man got arrested on DUI charges, we're guessing it didn't help his case that he was driving a stocked beer cooler at the time. The 22-year-old got pulled over Friday night for riding the motorized cooler down the middle of a street, reports Perth Now. He told police, reasonably, that he figured it would be safer than driving a car. The cooler, or "esky" as it is known in Australia, had been rigged to putt along at a top speed of about 12mph thanks to a small motor, wheels, and a steering column. Bizarre yes, but news.com.au recalls at least two similar arrests in recent years, enough to christen the stunts as "esky-pades."
Summary: An Australian man was arrested for driving a stocked beer cooler down the street on a motorized platform, which he claimed was safer than driving a car, despite previous similar arrests.
Story: – Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens initiated a physically aggressive unwanted sexual encounter with his hairdresser and threatened to distribute a partially nude photo of her if she spoke about it, according to testimony from the woman released Wednesday by a House investigatory committee. The graphic report details multiple instances in which the woman said Greitens spanked, slapped, grabbed, shoved, and called her derogatory names during a series of sexual encounters as the Republican was preparing to run for office in 2015. The testimony contradicts Greitens' previous assertions that "there was no violence" and "no threat of violence" in what he has described as a consensual extramarital affair, the AP reports. The report, signed by all five Republicans and two Democrats on the committee, describes the woman's testimony as credible and notes that Greitens has so far declined to testify. The committee is expanding its mission to recommend whether lawmakers should begin impeachment proceedings. Greitens is vowing to remain in office and prove his innocence against allegations that he calls "lies and falsehoods." He is to go to trial May 14 in St. Louis on a felony indictment of invasion of privacy for allegedly taking and transmitting a nonconsensual photo of the woman while she was partially nude. The woman told the committee that Greitens took the photo after manipulating her into a compromising position during an unwanted sexual encounter and that he told her "everyone will know what a little whore you are" if she told anyone about him.
Summary: Missouri Governor Eric Greitens allegedly initiated a physically aggressive and unwanted sexual encounter with his hairdresser, threatening to distribute a partially nude photo of her if she spoke about it, according to testimony released by a House investigatory committee.
Story: – Good news, wine and beer lovers: A new study finds that "moderate but regular" alcohol consumption appears to be linked to a lower risk of developing diabetes. Researchers surveyed more than 70,000 Danish participants over a five-year period and found that men who reported drinking 14 drinks a week and women who reported drinking nine per week were at the lowest risk (41% lower for men than those who did not drink, 58% lower for women), CNBC reports. "Our findings suggest that alcohol drinking frequency is associated with the risk of diabetes and that consumption of alcohol over three to four weekdays is associated with the lowest risks of diabetes," a researcher says. The lead author adds, "For the same total weekly amount of alcohol, spreading it out on more days is better than drinking it all together." Overall, drinking three to four days a week was linked to a 27% lower risk of diabetes (men) or 32% lower risk (women) than drinking less than one day a week, LiveScience reports. A caveat: While wine was found to be the best choice (the researchers hypothesize this could be because the polyphenol compounds in red wine could help with blood sugar management), followed by beer (for men only), clear spirits including gin and vodka were found to be linked with an increased risk of developing diabetes for women. Of course, outside health experts are warning people to be careful and not take this study as an excuse to over-indulge. And Time notes that while other studies have found a link between moderate drinking and a reduced risk, heavy drinking is known to increase diabetes risk.
Summary: Moderate and regular alcohol consumption, particularly of wine and beer, is associated with a lower risk of developing diabetes, according to a new study that surveyed over 70,000 Danish participants.
Story: – The Brown side of Bobbi Kristina Brown's family said over the weekend that the 22-year-old was "awake" and off life support, but the Houston side of the family disagreed soon thereafter. Sources connected with that side told TMZ and Gossip Cop yesterday that Bobbi Kristina, daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, is still in a coma, though she is breathing on her own—but Gossip Cop notes that she's actually been off a ventilator for "some time" now. Later, Cissy Houston released an official statement, obtained by NBC News: "While she is no longer in a medically induced coma she has a tracheotomy and according to the doctors she has global and irreversible brain damage and remains unresponsive. Meeting with the doctors and understanding that she can live in this condition for a lifetime truly saddens me. We can only trust in God for a miracle at this time." Sources tell CNN that Bobbi Kristina does not respond to visitors or voices, though Bobby Brown's wife says her eyes are open. But an attorney for the Brown family insisted to the cable channel yesterday that her condition has improved and "doctors have indicated that she will have a long life. However, Bobbi Kristina is presently embarking on a rehabilitation process, and the quality of her life will not be known for years to come." TMZ notes that the two sides of the family appear to "have different ideas about how to handle the prospect of long-term care." (These 17 celebrities have also been in comas.)
Summary: Bobbi Kristina Brown, daughter of Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, is in a coma and has global and irreversible brain damage, according to her mother Cissy Houston, despite reports of her being awake and off life support from her father's side of the family.
Story: – Victoria McGrath was 20 years old when she was pictured in an iconic photo, being carried to safety by a firefighter after a bomb went off just 5 feet from where she was standing at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon. Less than three years later, the survivor who inspired others as she made her recovery is dead. McGrath and her Northeastern University classmate, Priscilla Perez Torres, were killed in a car accident in Dubai, NBC News reports. "We are stunned, shocked and heartbroken," McGrath's mother writes in an email confirming the news. Also killed when their rented Ferrari crashed into a pole were Canadian boxer Cody Nixon and a man thought to be Nixon's cousin, reports the Boston Globe. They were reportedly on their way to Bali for spring break. "Just landed into Dubai picked up the Ferrari! Don’t worry I won’t speed ;)" wrote Nixon in an Instagram post hours before the fatal crash. The cause remains under police investigation. Among those mourning McGrath's loss is the firefighter who was pictured carrying her, James Plourde. "It’s been said that I helped to save her life, but the truth is Victoria saved my life after the Marathon as her love, support, and friendship helped myself and my family deal with the acts of 4/15/13," he said in a statement. Other marathon survivors took to social media upon hearing the news, notes MyFox Boston, which rounds up several posts. "Our hearts are heavy tonight," said one from brothers JP and Paul Norden. (A woman who lost her leg in the bombing has inspiring plans for this year's race.)
Summary: Victoria McGrath, a survivor of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing who was famously carried to safety by a firefighter, died in a car accident in Dubai at the age of 23, along with her Northeastern University classmate Priscilla Perez Torres and two others.
Story: – Just how bad was that NFL call by replacement refs last night? It's got Wisconsin's union-busting governor clamoring for an end to the labor dispute and a return of the union refs, reports Yahoo Sports. "After catching a few hours of sleep, the #Packers game is still just as painful," Scott Walker tweeted. "#Returntherealrefs." Given his history, a spokesman later clarified that Walker wasn't expressing support for unions. The tweet was all about "refs making bad calls." Still, Walker is taking a ribbing on Twitter. He wasn't the only politician to weigh in: Paul Ryan, who represents the Packers' home state in Congress: "Give me a break," he said, as per USA Today. "It's time to get the real refs. And do you know what, it reminds me of President Obama and the economy. If you can't get it right, it's time to get out." President Obama: "Terrible" call. "I've been saying for months we've got to get our refs back," said the Bears fan, according to AP. Jon Erpenbach, a Democratic state senator in Wisconsin, got creative and tweeted two phone numbers for NFL chief Roger Goodell, reports AP.
Summary: Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and other politicians, including Paul Ryan and President Obama, criticized the replacement referees in an NFL game, with Walker tweeting about "bad calls" and others expressing support for the return of the union refs.
Story: – The marriage of Mike and Karen Pence came under the media spotlight this week thanks mostly to one line in a Washington Post profile of Karen: "In 2002, Mike Pence told the Hill that he never eats alone with a woman other than his wife and that he won't attend events featuring alcohol without her by his side, either." That has triggered scorn and ridicule from the vice president's critics, while his defenders accuse those same critics of hypocrisy. Here's a look: The Post story by Ashley Parker describes how Karen, 60, is her husband's constant companion and his "gut check and shield." Among its tidbits: "During their time in the Indiana governor’s mansion, the Pences installed twin treadmills upstairs in their residence." Read it in full here. The 2002 article from the Hill doesn't appear to be online, but this tweet has the opening paragraphs, including a Pence quote: "If there's alcohol being served and people are being loose, I want to have the best-looking brunette in the room standing next to me." He said it's about "building a zone around your marriage" and avoiding even the appearance of impropriety. The idea of a man not dining alone with another woman is often known as the "Billy Graham rule" among evangelicals, explains the Indianapolis Star. One common line of criticism: "As someone who grew up Evangelical, wouldn't say it's standard exactly. But indicative of notion that women are primarily sexual temptresses," tweeted writer Elizabeth Spiers. Another: "If Pence won't eat dinner alone with any woman but his wife, that means he won't hire women in key spots," wrote Clara Jeffery of Mother Jones. Stephen Colbert couldn't resist. See the video and skip to 4:20. But Rod Dreher at the American Conservative sees hypocrisy in the negative reaction. "Were the Pences Orthodox Jews or practicing Muslims, nobody would have batted an eye. But they’re Evangelical Christians, so that means it’s open season on tearing them apart." At the Atlantic, Emma Green writes that the arrangement might seem crazy and even misogynistic to non-religious people, but not so to evangelicals, and "the dust-up shows how radically notions of gender divide American culture." Matt Lewis at the Daily Beast says this is the Pences' business and nobody else's. The backlash reveals "not just an irreverence for the devoutly religious (or traditional)—but also an intolerance for individual autonomy."
Summary: Mike Pence's strict policy of never dining alone with a woman other than his wife has sparked controversy and ridicule, with critics accusing him of hypocrisy and reinforcing harmful gender stereotypes, while defenders argue that it is a personal choice rooted in his religious beliefs.
Story: – A teenage boy who was kidnapped as an infant has been reunited with his father thanks to a school official's suspicion. When Sandy Hatte, 60, tried to enroll the boy at a school in northern Missouri, the official contacted police and discovered the boy had been abducted 13 years ago. Hatte—the boy's paternal grandmother, according to WDAF—has been charged with felony child abduction. Investigators say she had no legal rights to the child but had attempted to portray herself as his mother, the St. Joseph Post reports. One day in 2000, the boy's father "was working, came home from work, and [Hatte] was gone with the baby," a police spokesman tells ABC. "He hasn't been able to find them since." Investigators believe that Hatte and the boy spent the last 13 years moving around different cities, counties, and states, and were homeless at least once over the period. When the boy met his father again, it "was a good reunion," the police spokesman says. "You could tell within the first three minutes they hit it off pretty well. Since then, I've been on the phone with the dad and from what I'm understanding, it's going pretty well." (Click for the story of a 1964 kidnapping that made headlines ... this summer.)
Summary: A 13-year-old boy who was kidnapped as an infant was reunited with his father after a school official noticed inconsistencies in the man's story and contacted police, who discovered the boy's true identity and charged his paternal grandmother with felony child abduction.
Story: – Tea Party gatherings are being used by white supremacist and other hate groups to recruit members and spread their ideas, according to a new study by the NAACP. The "links between certain Tea Party factions and acknowledged racist hate groups in the US should give all patriotic Americans pause," warns the reports by the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights. The head of the NAACP in a forward to the report called on the party's leadership to "distance themselves" from those within the party who "espouse racist ideas, advocate violence or are formally affiliated with white supremacist" organizations. "The danger is not that the majority of Tea Party members share their views, but that left unchecked, these extremists might indirectly influence the direction of the Tea Party and therefore the direction of our country," writes Ben Jealous. Tea Party representatives blasted the findings. "The claim of racism is so stupid it defies response," said Sal Russo, a Sacramento-based Republican political consultant who created the Tea Party Express. "The movement has nothing to do with race whatsoever." Gary Dunn, a contributor to the party's Free Republic website, said moderators quickly remove any posted racist comments, reports the Guardian.
Summary: According to a new study by the NAACP, white supremacist and hate groups are using Tea Party gatherings to recruit members and spread their ideologies, despite denials from Tea Party representatives.
Story: – A picture a girl took of the back of her father's head has gone viral as it captures a moment that has brought some to tears. John Newman, 45, has been married to 49-year-old Marci Newman for almost 18 years, and he's taking quite seriously his vow to be there for her "in sickness and in health," reports CBS News. Since they learned in October that she had thyroid cancer, he has helped her through the many appointments, treatments, and surgeries that followed. But it was a simple photo their daughter Mackenna posted to Twitter on April 14 that has captured so many hearts. "My mom has to stay in her room in isolation for her cancer radiation so my dad set up a desk at her door to keep her company and I'm crying," she writes below a photo of her father. It shows him sitting at a small desk as he peers through an opening into the room where her mother is in isolation. It's been shared 10,000 times and liked more than 13,000 times. Mackenna explains to CBS that after having radioactive iodine treatment her mom had to sequester herself for five days so as not to expose others to radiation. She says her dad initially sat in the backyard and spoke to his wife through a window, and moved inside for her two final solo days. "The amount of love I've received is crazy and I didn't expect any of it, but I'm so grateful," Mackenna tells BuzzFeed. As for what her father is doing, she says it's just "how our family is; we take care of each other." (See how this man paid for his wife's medical bills.)
Summary: A photo of a man sitting at a desk outside his wife's isolation room during her radiation treatment for thyroid cancer has gone viral, capturing the couple's love and dedication to each other.
Story: – Over seven years, Virginia's Beth Prever raised $800,000 for ALS research because she "felt like having ALS would be a worst-case scenario diagnosis. It's like living in a glass coffin—your mind is intact, but your body is failing," she tells People. She now understands that horror better than she ever thought she would. After noticing her speech slurring last August, the Portsmouth native was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, in April. Her speech is now mostly garbled and she has trouble swallowing; she knows paralysis and respiratory failure are in her future. The Muscular Dystrophy Association notes patients diagnosed with the neurological condition—which has no clear cause or cure—typically live only three to five years, though there are exceptions. "It's so ironic that I would have ALS," Prever tells the Virginian-Pilot in an email. "I still cry and I'm still coming to terms with it … but I'm choosing to live my life with ALS and not consider it a death sentence." Prever is now checking items off her bucket list. She went skydiving on Sunday, reports WVEC, and hopes to see her "boyfriend" Bon Jovi in concert. She also plans to visit England, Ireland, Scotland, Montana, Alaska, Napa Valley, and New York City, where she'd love to see the Broadway play "Hamilton," reports WTKR. And in October, she'll attend her eighth ALS walk where 131 supporters will raise money for her care. The ALS community has "rallied around me. I feel so loved," Prever says. "I hope that my story will inspire others to use their time and talent to help other people. That will be my legacy." (See what the ice bucket challenge did for ALS research.)
Summary: Virginias Beth Prever, diagnosed with ALS at age 53, is living her life to the fullest despite her condition, checking off her bucket list items such as skydiving and attending concerts, while raising $800,000 for ALS research and inspiring others to do the same.
Story: – The son of two Chicago police officers was sentenced to nine months in prison Tuesday for his role in the "Celebgate" nude photo scandal. Edward Majerczyk, 29, admitted to stealing nude photos and other data from 30 celebrities in a phishing scheme, but his lawyers said "there is no evidence that he shared this information with anyone," per CNN. Still, he was ordered to pay $5,700 to cover counseling for one unnamed victim. Court documents showed Majerczyk possessed material belonging to 300 victims, including Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, and "people he came across in his life," prosecutors say, per the Chicago Tribune.
Summary: A 29-year-old man, Edward Majerczyk, was sentenced to 9 months in prison for his role in the "Celebgate" nude photo scandal, despite his lawyers arguing that he did not share the stolen information with anyone, and he was ordered to pay $5,700 in counseling for one of the victims.
Story: – She got nominated in November, and the Senate will finally get around to considering Loretta Lynch for the post of attorney general this week. Lynch got caught up in a partisan fight unrelated to her nomination that didn't get resolved until today, reports the Wall Street Journal. But once the finishing touches on that deal are made, "we’ll move to the president’s nominee for attorney general in the next day or so,” says Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The compromise came on a human-trafficking bill that got hung up over a dispute on abortion funding. Under the bill, fines raised will be used to help trafficking victims, but Democrats had filibustered because the legislation specifically ruled out using the money to pay for abortions. The compromise, as explained by the Washington Post: Victims can use the money for legal services but not for medical care, including abortions. If they need medical help, they'll be eligible to tap into a different fund already in place and already subject to abortion restrictions under the Hyde Amendment. The victims, then, still cannot use federal money to pay for abortions, but Democrats were OK with this change because the legislation doesn't expand the Hyde Amendment "to prohibit funds gathered from criminal fines from being used for abortion services," reports the Hill. Democrats feared that would set a bad precedent.
Summary: Loretta Lynch's nomination for Attorney General was delayed due to a partisan fight over a human-trafficking bill, but a compromise has been reached and her nomination is expected to be considered by the Senate soon.
Story: – If you don't wash the pre-washed spinach you buy from the store, you may want to stop reading. Actually, even if you do wash your spinach, you still may want to stop here. According to new findings by food safety researchers out of the University of California, Riverside, bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella can survive even the bleaching process used in food processing plants thanks to the many folds and contours in a typical spinach leaf. In fact, 15% of a typical spinach leaf sees itself exposed to only trace amounts of disinfectant. What remains can be much more than that: "Following rinsing under the low bleach condition, upwards of 90% of adhered bacteria were observed to remain attached to and survive on the leaf surface," per the university. Unfortunately, once those bacteria are there, they tend to multiply and spread, reports Yahoo Health. Worse still, "Rinsing isn’t going to do a whole heck of a lot for food safety," says Benjamin Chapman, a food safety specialist at North Carolina State University. Indeed, a second food safety expert tells Yahoo Health he won't eat raw spinach because of the risks; the CDC estimates that about 17% of Americans become ill and 3,000 die every year from foodborne diseases. Chapman says that while at-home washing essentially just removes bits of dirt and debris, cooking the spinach does eliminate the bacteria. These findings, which have not yet been submitted for publication but were Thursday presented at the 250th American Chemical Society National Meeting & Exposition, have implications beyond spinach since many leafy greens have lots of grooves. (Researchers have called this the No. 1 powerhouse vegetable.)
Summary: According to new research, even washing spinach does not completely remove harmful bacteria like E. coli and salmonella, as they can survive the bleaching process and multiply on the leaf surface, posing a food safety risk.
Story: – A 37-year-old Brooklyn man got 40 years to life today for kidnapping, murdering, and dismembering an 8-year-old boy who got lost on his way home from religious day camp, reports the AP. Levi Aron had previously pleaded guilty in the death of Leiby Kletzky to avoid a trial and the possibility of a life sentence without parole. As it is, he won't be eligible until he's 77. The New York Post's lead paragraph: "Let him rot!"
Summary: A 37-year-old man was sentenced to 40 years to life in prison for kidnapping, murdering, and dismembering an 8-year-old boy who got lost on his way home from religious day camp, with the possibility of parole after 77 years.
Story: – A German court is waiting for a doctor's take to see if it can haul a 93-year-old man into court to stand trial on 170,000 counts of accessory to murder. Officially referred to as "Reinhold H." (though the British press has IDed him as Reinhold Hanning), the elderly man is alleged to have been a member of the SS Totenkopf division—sometimes translated as the "Death's Head" division—and a guard at Auschwitz from 1942 to 1944. A court rep says it could take a few weeks to get Reinhold's health assessment back, though his lawyer is already saying his client isn't fit for trial. Although the suspect isn't accused of any specific killing, prosecutors say he helped select and funnel prisoners through the camp after they got there, the Guardian reports. Reinhold, meanwhile, insists he wasn't in the part of camp that carried out the killings, per the AP. One person who isn't buying the not-competent play is Tommy Lamm, a 69-year-old man whose grandparents and great-uncle were exterminated at Auschwitz. "I am appalled to hear that he is trying to play the dementia card, to escape justice," he told the Daily Mail from his Jerusalem home. "This cannot happen." Lamm says his relatives spent several days on a crammed train after they were taken by the Nazis, then were gassed after arriving at Auschwitz. Their fate, and the role Reinhold H. may have played, leave Lamm short on sympathy for the suspect, despite his advanced age. "I don't care if they are 100 years old, or 150," he tells the Mail. "They deserve the same fate as they [meted] out." (Auschwitz recently made headlines for its so-called "heat-wave showers.")
Summary: A 93-year-old former SS guard, Reinhold H., is facing trial for accessory to murder after being accused of helping select and funnel prisoners through Auschwitz during his time as a guard there from 1942 to 1944, despite not being directly accused of killing any specific prisoners.
Story: – The heir to the throne in Saudi Arabia ordered a series of stunning, high-profile arrests over the weekend. The upshot? Only what appears to be "the most sweeping transformation in the kingdom’s governance for more than eight decades," writes David Kirkpatrick in the New York Times. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (widely known as MBS) rounded up dozens of royals, ministers, and investors in the name of corruption, but the move is widely seen as a play by the prince to consolidate power and box out rivals. Details and developments: The tycoon: The biggest name among those arrested is Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who is one of the richest men in the world, reports the Wall Street Journal. He has scores of major investments in US companies, from GM to Apple to Twitter and Citigroup. He could face money laundering charges. The rival: Also arrested was Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, who ran the National Guard. The royal cousin—he is the son of the late King Abdullah, while MBS is the son of current King Salman—had been perhaps the crown prince's most serious rival for the throne. An analysis at the Middle East site al-Monitor sees this arrest as "the most crucial aspect" of the purge.
Summary: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has launched a sweeping crackdown on corruption, arresting dozens of royals, ministers, and investors, including the wealthy Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, in a bid to consolidate power and box out rivals.
Story: – More than 80% of US soldiers' deaths between 2001 and 2011 were the result of blood loss and septicemia. There's limited time to save trauma victims experiencing significant blood loss—the so-called "golden hour"—and researchers at the University of Alabama have been working for 19 years on a way to extend that time so that wounded soldiers and remote trauma victims are more likely to survive the long trip to a hospital. They think they've hit upon the secret ingredient—a synthetic version of the female sex hormone estrogen, and they've received a $10 million Defense Department grant to test it on humans. The breakthrough dates back to 1997 and is actually the result of a mistake. Researchers got an order of female mice instead of males; they almost didn't use the mice because of how much female hormone levels fluctuate, but they went ahead and were astonished to find that all of them resisted sepsis without any other treatment. When they tried it again with another batch of females it failed—because the mice were in a different part of their estrous cycles with lowered estrogen. After further testing, they found that synthetic estrogen also improves heart and liver function, even after 60% blood loss, because it dilates blood vessels, moving fluid more efficiently, reports Mental Floss. The latest estrogen variant, EE-3-SO4, helps prolong life for up to six hours post-trauma and could help not just trauma victims in general, but especially those with traumatic brain injuries. (This form of estrogen fuels lust and racy behavior.)
Summary: Researchers at the University of Alabama have discovered that a synthetic version of the female sex hormone estrogen, EE-3-SO4, can significantly extend the time it takes for trauma victims to succumb to blood loss and septicemia, with the potential to save lives in the "golden hour" window of time after an injury.
Story: – Salivating Democrats jumped all over Mitt Romney's foreign finances today, painting the candidate as an out-of-touch rich guy stuffing his cash in offshore mattresses—and in the case of Robert Gibbs, suggesting that Romney may have crossed legal boundaries. "We don't know" if Romney has acted illegally, Gibbs said. "The best way to see if Mitt Romney is complying with America tax law is to have him release more of his tax returns." Quipped Gibbs: "This is a guy whose slogan is 'Believe in America' and it should be 'Business in Bermuda.'" Elsewhere on your Sunday dial, as per Politico: Debbie Wasserman Schultz piles on: “Americans need to ask themselves: Why does an American businessman need a Swiss bank account and secretive investments like that?” And Martin O'Malley: “He wants to make it even easier for very wealthy people to avoid paying taxes, to offshore American jobs, and to maintain their Swiss bank accounts while our roads and bridges and levies crumble." John McCain on Syria: "How many more have to die before we take action? We need to show, first, leadership. The president of the United States should be speaking out for the people of Syria," McCain said, adding that, "Russian arms are pouring in, Iranians are on the ground. We need to establish a sanctuary so that they can organize." Mitch McConnell on if he's sorry he voted for John Roberts: "No, I'm not. I was extremely disappointed (by the Supreme Court ruling on ObamaCare). The chief justice, however, did make it clear that the mandate was a tax." Bill Kristol on Romney: “President Obama had three disappointing months, but he's holding his own. And if I were in the Romney campaign, that would worry me." Wasserman Schultz on Florida-New Hampshire roadtrip with kids, husband, four dogs, and cat: “And all of the dogs were actually in the car! So I proved it can be done.” Reince Priebus on aforementioned roadtrip and job numbers: “I don't know if she is on vacation in New Hampshire or on Mars. The fact of the matter is people are not better off today than they were three or four years ago, and the statistics bear it out."
Summary: Democrats have criticized Mitt Romney for his foreign financial dealings and suggested he may have broken legal boundaries, while also attacking him for his tax returns and business practices.
Story: – A Trump administration panel touted coal and nuclear energy in its only official appearance at an 11-day United Nations climate conference in Germany on Monday—when it could get its message out over jeering protesters and audience members. "Without question, fossil fuels will continue to be used," though we ought to employ a way that's "as clean and efficient as possible," Trump energy adviser George D. Banks said on the same day a study was released showing CO2 emissions rose to record highs in 2017, reports the New York Times. Though Banks said renewable energy has a "bright future," he said only diverse energy supplies, including coal plants where emissions are stored rather than released into the atmosphere, can meet current energy needs, particularly in developing countries. Though backed by some scientists, the message was "out of step" with the conference focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reports the Hill. "Promoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit," as Michael Bloomberg put it. Almost 75% of some 200 audience members interrupted the panel—which included an official from coal company Peabody Energy—to sing, "We the people are ready to lead, because the White House [is] making it hard to breathe," per the Washington Post. Audience shouts of "bunch of liars" and "clean coal is bullsh--" could also be heard once protesters cleared out, reports the Guardian. "Climate mitigation is an important goal of the United States, but I don't think it's any surprise that economic security and energy security are higher priorities," Banks concluded.
Summary: A Trump administration panel promoted coal and nuclear energy at a UN climate conference in Germany, despite record high CO2 emissions and opposition from the audience, with energy adviser George D. Banks arguing that diverse energy supplies, including coal plants with emissions storage, are necessary to meet current energy needs, particularly in developing countries.
Story: – Florida's orange crop is expected to increase for the first time in seven years, per the AP. The US Department of Agriculture announced Thursday that 79 million boxes of oranges are expected during the coming season, a 76% increase from the 45 million produced last season. That crop was ravaged by Hurricane Irma, and the industry is still suffering from citrus greening, a disease that kills trees. Each box of oranges weighs 90 pounds. "I was expecting it to be much lower than that. Very good," Mongi Zekri of the University of Florida tells the Naples Daily News. Still, the forecast is only about a third the size of the typical Florida orange crop of the early 2000s. Almost all Florida oranges are sold to juice manufacturers. The grapefruit crop is expected to grow 73% to 6.7 million boxes, and the combined tangerine and tangelo crop is expected to jump 60% to 1.2 million boxes.
Summary: Florida's orange crop is expected to increase by 76% to 79 million boxes this season, following a seven-year decline, but the crop is still significantly smaller than the early 2000s average and is affected by citrus greening disease.
Story: – Arrested Development will be back for a fifth season. Netflix, which revived the beloved sitcom for a fourth season in 2013, confirmed Wednesday that the series' fifth season will air on the streaming service in 2018. The original cast and creator Mitch Hurwitz are once again returning, Rolling Stone reports. Reaction so far is mixed; for example, Vanity Fair wonders whether a fifth season "can erase the memory of season 4."
Summary: Arrested Development will return for a fifth season on Netflix in 2018 with the original cast and creator Mitch Hurwitz, despite mixed reactions from fans regarding the show's recent revival.
Story: – Now that critics have landed on actor Stephen Fry's head like a ton of bricks for suggesting women hate sex because they don't often screw strange men in bushes, at least one Brit journalist is wondering, well, do women loathe sex? In fact, insists Steve Connor in the Independent, Fry is right in suggesting that men usually have more sexual relationships than women. That's because women, being more invested in the few offspring they create, tend to seek stable relationships with responsible males who can provide healthy genes and a nurturing home life, he adds. Men, on the other hand, are more evolutionarily driven to sow as many wild oats as possible to spread their genes as widely as possible. As for enjoying sex, the genders aren't so far apart. One "mystery of human sexuality" is the female orgasm, notes Connor. "Humans may be one of the few species where females actually enjoy sex physically as much as males." There's no further word from Fry, who has apparently quit Twitter in a snit over the flap triggered by interview quotes he claims were taken out of context. Who cares what Fry thinks anyway, snorts the Telegraph. Asking Fry, who is openly gay, to offer his views on female sexuality is like "Simon Cowell turning up to conduct the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra." (Women apparently don't hate bad sex. Click here for that story.)
Summary: A journalist argues that men tend to have more sexual partners than women due to evolutionary drives, while women prioritize stable relationships and seeking healthy genes, and that both genders enjoy sex but there is a mystery surrounding female orgasm.
Story: – The shutdown showdown is over, at least until the fall. The House and Senate today passed a measure to fund the government through September, the end of the 2011 fiscal year. The bill passed 260-167 in the House on a bipartisan vote, required because 59 Republicans broke ranks and voted against it, reports Politico. It then cleared the Senate, 81-19, and headed to President Obama's desk for his signature. As agreed upon in last week's down-to-the-wire negotiations, it calls for $38 billion in spending cuts, notes the New York Times. John Boehner: “Is it perfect? No. I’d be the first to admit it’s flawed. But welcome to divided government.” Democratic whip Steny Hoyer: “The priorities that we have agreed to in this resolution are not my priorities. But we have reached an agreement.”
Summary: The House and Senate have passed a measure to fund the government through September with $38 billion in spending cuts, despite 59 Republicans voting against it in the House and some Democrats expressing dissatisfaction with the agreement.
Story: – Among the latest casualties as Texas endures stunning amounts of rain: Homecoming queen Alyssa Ramirez, who spent Saturday night dancing at her prom. While driving home in Devine, Texas, on Sunday, Ramirez's car stalled in high water and the cheerleader and star athlete was swept away by flood waters, NBC News reports. "She called 911. She called her father, but it was just too much and too quick," the teen's aunt says. Her body was found a short distance from the road. Days before she died, Ramirez posted this quote online: "Even though it is never pleasant to experience hardship, it teaches us to persevere and to cling to God. He will never desert us." More on the flooding: Flash-flood watches and warnings have been issued in eight states as 30 million Americans are bracing for thunderstorms that could bring flooding, hail, and even tornadoes as far north as Chicago and Milwaukee, NBC News reports. Some 19 tornadoes were reported in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Mississippi yesterday. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has declared a state of disaster in 24 counties, including Houston. He flew over areas south of Austin to assess damage yesterday and tells Reuters, "This is the biggest flood this area of Texas has ever seen." He said the storm was "a relentless wall of water that mowed down huge trees like they were grass." Houston is battling "extremely dangerous and potentially life-threatening" conditions with hourly rainfall topping 4 inches at times overnight, the Houston Chronicle reports. Interstates 10 and 45 were closed as rainfall at Houston Intercontinental Airport hit 4.34 inches yesterday, almost doubling the previous record set in 1946. A resident says the storm is "a close second" to 2008's Hurricane Ike. An explainer is here. More than 80,000 people are without power in Houston and several have been stranded throughout the city. About 200 remained at the Toyota Center early today after watching the Rockets play. Knee-high flood waters left others trapped in a mall. "We have tried to make them as comfortable as we can," a security guard says, per NBC News. Eight people have been killed in Texas and Oklahoma since flooding began, including a 14-year-old boy found in a storm drain. Another 12, including two families, are still missing in Wimberley, Texas, after the home they were vacationing in was swept away Sunday.
Summary: Homecoming queen Alyssa Ramirez was killed in Texas flooding after her car stalled in high water and she was swept away, days after she posted a quote about persevering through hardship.
Story: – Jimmy Kimmel has a new political foil—Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. It began earlier this week when Kimmel sent a comedian heckler to a Moore speech, and Moore shot back on Twitter with a message to the TV host: "If you want to mock our Christian values, come down here to Alabama and do it man to man." On Thursday night, Kimmel said he would accept the invitation, and then some. If Moore wanted to fight, Kimmel said he would "wear a Girl Scout uniform so you can have something to get excited about." The proceeds, he added, should go to charity, and "my charity will be the women who came forward to say you molested them." See the video here. As for the earlier stunt, it involved comedian Tony Barbieri, who showed up at a Moore speech as the fictional Jake Byrd and pretended to be a vocal supporter of the candidate, reports Al.com. As Moore spoke in a church in Theodore, Alabama, on Wednesday night, Barbieri shouted, "That's a man's man," and, "Does that look like the face of a molester?" before being ushered out. (Moore continues to deny the allegations.)
Summary: Jimmy Kimmel has challenged Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore to a confrontation, offering to wear a Girl Scout uniform to a potential fight and donating the proceeds to charity, specifically the women who have accused Moore of molestation.
Story: – David Arquette and Courteney Cox were plagued by rumors before finally announcing their separation—rumors that Cox was having an affair with a co-star and rumors that Arquette was going out on the town and acting single. “Courteney and Brian [Van Holt, who plays her ex-husband on Cougar Town] were all over each at a wrap party in April and the talk on the set was that it was fine because she and David had an open marriage,” a source tells Radar. Cox supposedly spent at least one night with Van Holt in April and was often spotted with him looking quite chummy, including at a party hosted by Arquette himself last year. Now, Arquette seems to have moved on as well. He’s been spotted with Jasmine Waltz, a bartender who’s been linked to Ryan Seacrest, Jesse McCartney, Doug Reinhardt, and other stars. (She’s also, oddly enough, the waitress who allegedly punched Lindsay Lohan in July.) But it’s not all bad news in the world of former Friends: Click here to see which of Cox’s former co-stars secretly got married recently.
Summary: David Arquette and Courteney Cox separated after rumors of her alleged affair with a co-star and his own alleged infidelity, with Arquette now spotted with a new woman, Jasmine Waltz, while Cox's former co-star, Brian Van Holt, is said to have married recently.
Story: – The Justice Department may be gearing up to sue the state of South Dakota after a report released Monday found thousands of people with disabilities that could potentially be managed at home are being relegated to nursing homes or other long-term-care facilities instead, the New York Times reports. This most recent probe (the Times says there have been more than 50 around the country) is part of federal efforts to cut down on the 250,000 or so disabled people under the age of 65 "unfairly" placed in nursing homes—what a 2013 Senate committee report says flouts the Americans With Disabilities Act and violates a Supreme Court ruling made nearly two decades ago. "Regardless of their age, people with disabilities deserve privacy, autonomy, and dignity in their everyday lives," the head of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division says in the report. One 73-year-old tells the Times some nursing homes are nothing more than "warehouses," with the paper noting patients are often kept from cooking their own meals or going out with friends unless they're signed out—"like a kid," another resident says. The 1999 Supreme Court case anchoring this civil rights dilemma, Olmstead vs. LC, ruled that, under the ADA, people with disabilities have a right to receive help without being segregated from the rest of society. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard—who was sent a 35-page letter from the DOJ outlining his state's violations and calling for "corrective action," per Disability Scoop—tells the Times in a statement he agrees with federal efforts in theory but struggles with implementation because of the many rural communities in his state. (Some want online shopping more accessible.)
Summary: The Justice Department may sue South Dakota for violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by placing thousands of people with disabilities in nursing homes instead of providing them with home-based care, despite a Supreme Court ruling that people with disabilities have the right to receive help without being segregated from society.
Story: – The Pakistani army is investigating reports that the leader of the Taliban in the country has died after being injured in an American military drone strike. Hakimullah Mehsud, 28, had been at the helm of the Pakistani Taliban for 5 months, having taken over after the death—also in a drone strike—of Baitullah Mehsud, reports the Los Angeles Times. But a source within the Taliban says Hakimullah Mehsud is alive and has gone "underground" to dodge a recent campaign of drone attacks, CNN reports.
Summary: The Pakistani army is investigating reports that the leader of the Taliban in the country, Hakimullah Mehsud, has died after being injured in an American military drone strike, but a Taliban source claims he is alive and has gone "underground" to evade further drone attacks.
Story: – You're staring down a $600 credit card bill and $60,000 in student loan debt: Which do you tackle first? Conventional wisdom says whichever has the higher interest rate. A new study out of Texas A&M says ignore those rates—and start with that credit card bill. It all boils down to motivation: Successfully bring one balance down to zero, and that "small victory" could give you the steam you need to power through bigger balances, the researchers explain. How they arrived at their conclusion: Study participants were asked to retype 150 10-character strings in an Excel spreadsheet; they worked faster as they approached the end of columns and slowed down as they started a new column, suggesting they had a motivational surge when the end was in sight, Science Daily reports. Further, when their task was broken down "into parts of unequal size," participants were least likely to complete tasks in ascending order, that is, smallest to largest. But subjects actually performed faster when the parts were ordered that way, Alexander L. Brown and Joanna N. Lahey write in the Journal of Marketing Research. The theory is also known as the debt-snowball method of debt reduction, popularized by finance expert Dave Ramsey. "The math seems to lean more toward paying the highest interest debts first, but what I have learned is that personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior," he told the Huffington Post in 2014. The researchers do acknowledge there are some situations in which "the increase in motivation may not offset the additional interest accrued by not paying."
Summary: According to a new study, ignoring the interest rates and tackling the credit card bill first can be more effective in reducing debt due to the motivational boost of achieving small victories, rather than following the conventional wisdom of paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first.
Story: – White House watchers have one less thing to speculate about after first lady Melania Trump returned home Saturday from a five-day stay at Walter Reed Medical Center. The first lady is "resting comfortably and remains in high spirits," a rep said in a statement, per the New York Times. Asked about speculation over Trump's longer-than-expected stay after a kidney procedure, the rep said that "every patient is different. Mrs. Trump has a medical team that is comfortable with her care, which is all that matters. Her recovery and privacy are paramount and I will have no further comment beyond this." "Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melania is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!" tweeted President Trump, though CNN notes that he misspelled his wife's name as "Melanie" in the original tweet. Trump had no public events on his schedule on the day of his wife's return.
Summary: First Lady Melania Trump has returned home from a five-day stay at Walter Reed Medical Center, where she underwent a kidney procedure, and is resting comfortably and in high spirits, according to a rep, despite speculation about her longer-than-expected stay.
Story: – Well, this is sure to improve things for Team Weiner: After ex-intern Olivia Nuzzi wrote a tell-all article about working on Anthony Weiner's mayoral campaign, Weiner's communications director responded by going on a less-than-professional rant in which she labeled Nuzzi a "slutbag" and a "bitch," among other, even less flattering names. A timeline: Nuzzi first came to the world's attention when she told an amusing little story about Weiner's tendency to (incorrectly) refer to female interns as "Monica." On Monday, Nuzzi wrote another article on NSFWcorp alleging there had been more departures from Weiner's campaign team than previously reported; she alleged his campaign manager left because Weiner lied to him about the timing of his sexting misconduct. Then, yesterday, Nuzzi appeared on the front cover of the New York Daily News. Inside, she bylined an article about working on the campaign, claiming that many interns only came onboard in the hopes of connecting with Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin. Nuzzi also trashed the "short résumés" of many campaign staffers ... including, yes, communications director Barbara Morgan, who "last worked as the press secretary for the New Jersey state education commissioner," Nuzzi wrote. That's when Morgan responded in a conversation with Talking Points Memo (about an unrelated story) in which she used the aforementioned terms, and also said she "tried to fire" Nuzzi at one point because "she sucked" at her job. One example: "She like wasn’t good at setting up events. ... Like it was, like, terrible and I had to like—she would like, she would just not show up for work," Morgan explained. "And then like she had the f---ing balls to like trash me in the paper." Oh, it gets more amusing from there; we'd highly recommend you read the whole thing. Not surprisingly, Morgan put out a statement last night to Business Insider: "In a moment of frustration, I used inappropriate language in what I thought was an off the record conversation. It was wrong and I am very sorry, which is what I said tonight when I called and emailed Olivia to apologize." TPM denies the conversation was off the record.
Summary: Communications director Barbara Morgan for Anthony Weiner's mayoral campaign was caught on a hot mic using derogatory language to describe former intern Olivia Nuzzi, including calling her a "slutbag" and "bitch," after Nuzzi wrote an article detailing the chaos within the campaign.
Story: – Ukraine's elite Berkut anti-riot police unit has been disbanded by the country's acting interior minister after the unit was accused of brutality and blamed for the deaths of protesters. Arsen Avakov said he will give more details about what will happen to the 4,000 to 5,000 officers today, the BBC reports. The Berkut is just one "much-despised" law enforcement agency in the country; other security agencies have also been accused of human rights abuses. Meanwhile in Ukraine: The whereabouts of ousted president Viktor Yanukovich are still unknown. In addition to the warrant that is out for his arrest, parliament voted yesterday to try him at the Hague's International Criminal Court. A new Cabinet is expected to be presented to protesters today. Meanwhile, acting president Oleksandr Turchinov announced he has taken on the duties of head of the armed forces. As part of the hunt for Yanukovich, the US Treasury yesterday asked banks to watch for suspicious financial transactions indicating he or his allies might be trying to transfer state assets, Reuters reports. Tensions in Ukraine are still high, particularly between pro-Russia and anti-Russia groups, and two rival protests are going on in Crimea. Separatism or secession continues to be considered a serious threat. Russian President Vladimir Putin put troops in western Russia on alert today, ordering a drill to ensure they're ready for combat, Reuters reports. Yanukovich's opulent estate wasn't to be his only plush pad: The New York Times reports that a "Pharaonic seaside retreat" was being built for him in Laspi on the Crimean coast, in the middle of a supposedly protected forest with views of the Black Sea. The mansion was to be bigger than his presidential residence, with an indoor swimming pool and hot tub, thick walls and high ceilings, marble floors, and the like. But construction was halted after his ouster, since workers figured he'd never pay them. When elections are held on May 25, former boxing champ Vitali Klitchsko will be one of the presidential contenders, NBC News reports. Bank withdrawals peaked during the uprising, with as much as 7% of deposits being taken out, and now Ukraine is working to protect against a default, Bloomberg reports.
Summary: The Ukrainian elite Berkut anti-riot police unit has been disbanded after accusations of brutality and the deaths of protesters, with the whereabouts of ousted President Viktor Yanukovich still unknown and a warrant for his arrest, while a new Cabinet is expected to be presented to protesters and acting President Oleksandr Turchinov has taken on the duties of head of the armed forces, with tensions high between pro-Russia and anti-Russia groups and separatism considered a serious threat, while Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered troops on alert for combat and Yanukovich's opulent estate, under construction in Crimea, has been halted.
Story: – Love mac n' cheese? Love Cheetos? Burger King hopes you'll love Mac n' Cheetos. The new 310-calorie snack is basically mozzarella sticks but stuffed with macaroni along with the cheese and cased in Cheetos-flavored breading, per Time. So far, reviews are mixed. One Twitter user says it's the "best thing BK has come up with yet," while another calls it a "fast food abomination." The Verge sums it up as "coagulated orange clumps of processed cheese." The $2.49 pack of five bites will be available at select locations for a maximum of eight weeks, but a Burger King rep tells Bloomberg more snack-inspired menu items are coming.
Summary: Burger King has introduced a new snack called Mac n Cheetos, which is a mozzarella stick-like product filled with macaroni and Cheetos-flavored breading, with mixed reviews from customers.
Story: – Twitter presented to the House and Senate intelligence committees Thursday in their ongoing investigations into Russian election interference, the AP reports. It did not go great. Sen. Mark Warner says the presentation was "deeply disappointing" and "frankly inadequate on almost every level." The ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee says the presentation "showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is, the threat it poses to democratic institutions." According to Recode, Twitter revealed it found 200 or so accounts it believes had ties to Russian trolls. It has since deleted those accounts, the Washington Post reports. The problem, at least according to lawmakers, is that Twitter apparently only found those accounts by piggybacking on the work done by Facebook. Facebook had already reported 470 pages originating at the Internet Research Agency, a "Russia-connected troll farm." Those pages bought thousands of ads ahead of the 2016 election, many of which contained divisive messages on religion and race. Twitter says it found 22 accounts that matched those 470 Facebook pages and another 179 accounts tied to the first 22. "If it wasn’t for Facebook’s data, [Twitter] would have no idea these were even Russian accounts,” says a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Google, Facebook, and Twitter—which could face new regulations from Congress—are being called to publicly testify Nov. 1.
Summary: Twitter faced criticism from lawmakers after presenting its findings on Russian election interference to the House and Senate intelligence committees, with Sen. Mark Warner and the ranking Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee expressing disappointment and concern over Twitter's lack of understanding of the issue and its reliance on Facebook's data to identify Russian accounts.
Story: – The NRA endorsed Donald Trump during its national convention in Kentucky on Friday, NBC News reports. According to CNN, Trump called the endorsement a "fantastic honor." In a speech immediately following, he said American citizens "sitting in an apartment" need guns because “outside is tremendous crime; tremendous crimes of all kinds," Politico reports. Trump said Hillary Clinton plans on destroying the right to bear arms. “She wants to abolish the second amendment," ABC News quotes him as saying. "She wants to take your guns away.” He said that's why he's going to add "Heartless Hillary" to the list of nicknames he uses for Clinton. Clinton has never advocated for repealing the second amendment. During his speech, Trump also promised to eliminate all of the country's gun-free zones, which includes schools and military bases. (A Huffington Post editor points out on Twitter that those gun-free zones include the Trump Hotel in Chicago and his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.) Trump said the San Bernardino attack and other mass shootings could have been avoided if more people had guns. But Trump hasn't always been so anti-gun control. In the past, he's backed a ban on assault weapons and advocated for longer waiting periods for gun purchases. NBC notes Trump has changed his tune on gun control since starting his run for president.
Summary: The NRA endorsed Donald Trump at its convention in Kentucky, with Trump claiming Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the second amendment and take away guns, despite Clinton never advocating for repealing it, and Trump promised to eliminate all gun-free zones, including those at his own properties.
Story: – If sources are to be believed, Fox News could be headed toward its third major prime-time lineup shuffle this year. A "source with knowledge of the matter" tells CNN that Laura Ingraham is in talks with Fox executives to get her own show on the network. That report was confirmed to Variety by a "person familiar with the outlet's plans." Ingraham has been a contributor with Fox News since 2007 and has filled in for both Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly on occasion. Talks are said to be in their early stages, and nothing has been finalized. Neither Fox News nor Ingraham have commented. Fox News had to switch up its prime-time lineup earlier this year, first with the departure of Megyn Kelly and then again when O'Reilly was ousted amid sexual harassment allegations, the Los Angeles Times reports. Now, the networks is faced with the possibility of host Eric Bolling, also facing sexual harassment allegations, getting the boot, as well. That would create an opening for Ingraham, a strident supporter of President Trump who sources say could be a good fit between Hannity and Tucker Carlson. “She’s always been a go-to solution for Fox News,” one source says. Giving Ingraham her own show could also allow Fox News to move Hannity up an hour to compete directly with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.
Summary: Fox News is in talks with Laura Ingraham to give her her own prime-time show, potentially replacing Eric Bolling, who is facing sexual harassment allegations, and creating a new lineup that could compete with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.
Story: – Drenched Colorado is staring down the possibility of four more inches of rain today, having already absorbed 15 inches amid devastating floods, and officials are now telling residents to get out while they can—or face weeks without power and running water. "We're not trying to force anyone from their home," says Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle. "But we're trying to be very factual and definitive about the consequences of their decision, and we hope that they will come down." At least four have died in the flooding, but some 500 are unaccounted for; officials emphasize that that number includes people who just haven't been in contact with relatives, reports CNN. "I was thinking about staying. I could have lasted at least a year," says one teacher sitting in a shelter, who tells the AP that many of his neighbors "right by the river, their houses were washed away. It's just really devastating." Adds his wife: "They said they wouldn't force you, but it was strongly encouraged," to leave. President Obama last night declared Boulder County a disaster area, which frees up federal funds; other counties may be added to the list. The AP notes that as of last night some 1,750 people had been evacuated from Boulder and Larimer County.
Summary: Residents of Boulder and Larimer counties are being strongly encouraged to evacuate their homes due to the risk of weeks without power and running water after the area has already absorbed 15 inches of rain and faces the possibility of four more inches, with at least four deaths and 500 people unaccounted for.
Story: – President Obama says he learned Hillary Clinton was using a home-grown email account while she was his secretary of state at "the same time everybody else learned it—through news reports." His comments came via an interview with CBS airing this morning, though the New York Times notes that the president failed to address the elephant in the room: How he could have failed to notice that his top diplomat was emailing from a clintonemail.com domain rather than state.gov? He continues: "The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency. And that's why my emails through BlackBerry that I carry around—all those records are available and archived." As to whether Clinton's private email furthered that transparency, Obama said, "I’m glad that Hillary’s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed" and "the fact that she is going to be putting them forward will allow us to make sure that people have the information they need." Meanwhile, CNN reports that Bill Clinton weighed in on the brouhaha—by not exactly weighing in. "I'm not the one to judge that. I have an opinion but I have a bias. I shouldn't be making news on this." Added Sen. Dianne Feinstein, an unabashed champion of a Clinton 2016 run, speaking this morning on Meet the Press: "She needs to step up and come out and say what the situation is. From this point on, the silence is going to hurt her."
Summary: President Obama revealed in an interview that he learned Hillary Clinton was using a personal email account while she was his secretary of state through news reports, and he emphasized his administration's policy of transparency, while avoiding direct comment on how he could have missed Clinton's private email use.
Story: – Private Thomas Hurdis' death in October 1917 was a grisly one. The Australian soldier was shot in the face with lead bullets during the Battle of Passchendaele in France, blinding the 27-year-old and destroying parts of his jaw and sinuses. Philadelphia ophthalmologist WT Shoemaker tended to the soldier, who bled to death five days after sustaining the injuries after he tore out the bandages that were packed into his cheek. His body was interred in a military cemetery in Le Tréport, France; his skull wasn't, until now. The Guardian reports the skull had for nearly a century been in the possession of the Mutter Museum of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, which says the British government donated it two years after Hurdis' death "for study by military doctors conducting reconstructive surgery on soldiers." While Australia acknowledged the museum obtained the skull in a manner "entirely consistent with the applicable laws and protocols," it requested that it be repatriated, and the museum announced Tuesday it will oblige. Philly.com reports US and British armies have permitted skulls of dead soldiers to be used for medical education so long as the soldier wasn't identified. But once the Guardian in late September raised the question of the soldier's identity, a British military forum used details regarding the location, timing, and position of the soldier's wounds to conclude the skull likely belonged to Hurdis. The AP reports the museum was founded in 1863 and displays such oddities as the body of a woman "who essentially turned to soap" and a tumor removed from President Grover Cleveland. (The remains of 23 WWI soldiers may be slumbering here.)
Summary: Private Thomas Hurdis, an Australian soldier who died in 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele in France, had his skull removed and is now being repatriated to Australia after being in the possession of a Philadelphia museum for nearly a century.
Story: – Today's kids don't read, right? Wrong, io9 reports: A Pew survey finds that some 67% of those ages 16 to 29 read a book at least once a week—more than the 58% of adults ages 30 and older who do so. Meanwhile, 43% of the younger group reads daily or almost daily, compared to 40% of the older group. The under-30s also visit the library at about the same rate as the 30-plus set. But millennials are less likely than older folks to say public libraries are key parts of their communities, the Atlantic reports. And when it comes to reading the news, the older group does it more often—64% read it in print or online daily or almost daily, compared to 55% of the younger group. Interestingly, however, millennials are more likely than older Americans to agree that there is "a lot of useful, important information that is not available on the Internet." (Meanwhile, only one in four millennials plans to vote this fall, and their political views are influenced by a surprising character.)
Summary: While the common perception is that today's youth don't read, a Pew survey finds that 67% of 16-29 year olds read a book at least once a week, with 43% reading daily or almost daily, compared to 58% of adults 30+, with the younger group visiting libraries at the same rate as the older group, but being less likely to consider public libraries as key parts of their communities, and millennials are more likely than older Americans to agree that there is "a lot of useful, important information that is not available on the Internet."
Story: – Emad Burnat is nominated for Best Documentary for his film about the Palestinian protest of an Israeli security fence in the West Bank, 5 Broken Cameras—but he didn't have an easy time of it yesterday when he entered the US to attend Sunday's award ceremony. According to Michael Moore's Twitter account and a statement from Burnat picked up by the Hollywood Reporter, Burnat and his family were held up for more than an hour by immigration officials at LAX who threatened to send the family home because authorities were skeptical of his claim to be an Oscar nominee. The family was eventually released after Moore contacted the Academy, whose lawyers contacted immigration. "Although this was an unpleasant experience, this is a daily occurrence for Palestinians, every single day, throughout he West Bank," says the filmmaker's statement. "There are more than 500 Israeli checkpoints, roadblocks, and other barriers to movement across our land, and not a single one of us has been spared the experience that my family and I experienced yesterday. Ours was a very minor example of what my people face every day." Click for a Burnat interview about the incident via the Huffington Post.
Summary: Emad Burnat, the director of the Oscar-nominated documentary "5 Broken Cameras," was detained for over an hour at LAX airport by immigration officials who were skeptical of his nomination and threatened to deport him and his family, despite intervention from the Academy.
Story: – Mike Pence is "committed to seeing the tax cut through to the finish line"—so committed, in fact, that he'll delay a trip to the Middle East, his press secretary announced Monday. The vice president was to travel Tuesday to Egypt and Israel but will now depart on Jan. 14, according to White House officials. They say protests in the region regarding President Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital had no impact on the decision, reports CNN. Rather, Pence plans to be on hand for the Senate vote on the GOP tax bill late Tuesday or early Wednesday in case he needs to break a tie—a plausible scenario as Republican Sen. John McCain could be absent while undergoing cancer treatment. An official tells the New York Times that Pence already delayed the trip once in anticipation of the vote. As of last week, he was expected to depart Tuesday and meet with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Wednesday before traveling to Israel, with a stop at Jerusalem's Western Wall, reports CBS News. If Pence were to depart after the vote, each event—including meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin—would need to be pushed back. It's unclear if the delay will allow Pence to reschedule a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who canceled in the wake of the US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Summary: Mike Pence has delayed a trip to the Middle East to be available for the Senate vote on the GOP tax bill, potentially to break a tie in the event of a close vote, due to the Vice President's commitment to seeing the tax cut through to the finish line.
