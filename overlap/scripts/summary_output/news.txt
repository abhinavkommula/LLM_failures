Story: – President Trump on Monday highlighted a contrast between a former ally and a current one, and he hopes the former ally spends a long time in prison. The man he wants to see in jail is Michael Cohen, who is cooperating with Robert Mueller's investigation after taking a plea deal. “Michael Cohen asks judge for no Prison Time," tweeted Trump. "You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long prison term?" He accused Cohen of making up "stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself" and should, "in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence." In the same Twitter stream, Trump drew a contrast to Roger Stone. Details and developments: A promise: Trump took note of Stone's weekend vow that he will never testify against the president. "He will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about 'President Trump,'" wrote Trump. "Nice to know that some people still have 'guts!'” What Stone said: "There's no circumstance under which I would testify against the president, because I'd have to bear false witness against him," Stone told ABC's This Week, per Fox News. "I'd have to make things up, and I'm not going to do that." Stone insisted he had no contact with Julian Assange of WikiLeaks in regard to the leak of Democratic emails, something Mueller is investigating. A slam: Attorney George Conway, a frequent critic of Trump who also is the husband of Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, responded to Trump's Stone tweet with one of his own. It referenced sections of the federal criminal code dealing with witness tampering, among other things, reports CNBC.

Story: – A UK resident who suffered headaches and seizures for four years was ultimately handed an unusual explanation for his woes: There was a worm in his brain, reports the Guardian. Specifically, doctors removed a 1-centimeter-long tapeworm called Spirometra erinaceieuropaei. Based on scans taken over several years, the worm traveled about 2 inches from the right side of his brain to the left, though doctors didn't realize it was a worm until they conducted a biopsy. The 50-year-old patient is mostly fine, though he's still suffering some issues due to having served as host for the parasite. This particular tapeworm most generally affects amphibians and crustaceans, and is exceedingly rare in humans: In roughly six decades, only 300 cases have been recorded. The one upside is that scientists were able to sequence its genome, they report via Eureka Alert. That should enable them to more easily identify and treat for it in the future. “This genome will act as a reference, so that when new treatments are developed for the more common tapeworms, scientists can cross-check whether they are also likely to be effective against this very rare infection," says a Cambridge geneticist. It's not clear how the man got infected, but the best guess is that he picked it up on a visit to China, perhaps from infected meat or water. The mouthless tapeworm is thought to have absorbed nutrients from the brain directly into its body. (In India, doctors once found a worm inside a patient's eye.)

Story: – Photos may back up a Burger King manager's story that Chicago police officers deleted 86 minutes of surveillance video from the night Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times. Screen grabs from a camera inside an office at the eatery show at least one officer at a computer terminal on Oct. 20, 2014. District manager Jay Darshane told NBC Chicago back in May that four to five officers spent hours in the Burger King after Laquan's shooting 50 yards away. After they left, there was a gap in footage from 9:13pm to 10:39pm, Darshane said; McDonald was first shot at 9:57pm. "We had no idea they were going to sit there and delete files. I mean, we were just trying to help the police officers," said Darshane. He added the restaurant's cameras and video recorder were on and working normally. However, a source close to the investigation tells the Chicago Sun-Times that Burger King's system "would break down in the weeks and months before this incident. There were major gaps everywhere." The source adds the FBI had the video "forensically analyzed" and found "absolutely no evidence of any tampering or any removal of any portion of the tape." State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said last week that forensic testing showed no one tampered with the video. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is expected to announce the forming of a task force on Tuesday that "will review the system of accountability, oversight, and training that is currently in place for Chicago's police officers," according to a release. The panel will have four months to recommend changes to the police department, per the Chicago Tribune.

Story: – Newly minted BP CEO Bob Dudley spoke out in defense of his company’s handling of the Gulf oil spill today, saying there had been “a great rush to judgment” on the part of the media and rival oil companies. “I watched graphic projections of oil swirling around the Gulf, around Florida, across and around Bermuda to England,” he said, according to MarketWatch, none of which happened. He expressed hope for a “balanced and informed judgment about what happened.” He also reaffirmed that BP was committed to its Gulf business. “I didn’t become the chief executive of BP in order to walk away from the US,” he said. “BP won’t be quitting America.” That pronouncement comes on the same day that BP announced plans to sell off four of its deepwater Gulf wells, according to the Financial Times. BP said it had planned to sell the wells anyway, but had done so faster to pay spill expenses.

Story: – Before US special operations forces raided the Pakistani compound where Osama bin Laden was hiding out in 2011, there was likely at least one other type of specialist with boots on the ground: a weatherman. The Air Force's SOWTs—special operations weather technicians—are some of the military's least-recognized tools, with members sent out to infiltrate enemy lines (where weather reports from the ground can often be scarce) and tap into their meteorology training to gauge climate conditions for their commanders, NBC News reports. These Grey Berets not only predict if the weather is amenable to launching an attack (unmanned aircraft and low-flying choppers have to be especially careful in bad weather); they also use the weather to their advantage, perhaps using mountain dew to erase tracks, or wind to dampen the sounds of a chopper, NBC explains. "We're human sensors," SOWT Jonathan Sawtelle tells NBC. A persistent issue for SOWTs is not being taken seriously by colleagues, an attitude that riles environmental mercenaries. "In special operations, most of the failures have weather as a causal effect," an ex-director of environmental services for Joint Special Operations Command tells NBC. And training for this role is brutal—including getting kicked in the ribs by instructors and sprayed with water during exercises to trigger drowning fears—and requires a minimum intelligence-test score that's higher than that of nearly every other role in the military. As NBC puts it, recruits are "warriors first, meteorologists second." One SOWT compares it to high school, with other special-ops troops as the starting QBs and homecoming kings, and military meteorologists "kind of like the valedictorians. ... We've got the 4.0 grade point average, but we can play a little, too." (Read the entire story about this fascinating military career.)

What is the comparison made by an SOWT to their role in the military?These questions should help us gain a deeper understanding of the role of SOWTs in special operations and the challenges they face in their work.
Story: – If Iran's more moderate new president is to be believed, the US doesn't have to worry about Tehran pursuing nuclear weapons. “We have never pursued or sought a nuclear bomb, and we are not going to do so,” Hasan Rouhani tells Ann Curry of NBC News. “We solely are looking for peaceful nuclear technology.” He also dismissed the idea that President Obama looked weak on Syria, with words that are hard to imagine coming from predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: “We consider war a weakness. Any government or administration that decides to wage a war, we consider a weakness. And any government that decides on peace, we look on it with respect to peace.” Of course, Iranian officials have insisted previously that they have only peaceful nuclear intentions, notes Reuters, but Rouhani's comments are seen as a further thawing of relations with the West in general and the US in particular. He described a recent letter from President Obama as "positive and constructive" and said "it could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future." Rouhani will be in the US in less than a week to address the UN General Assembly.

Story: – Taylor Dumpson began her first day as the first black female president of American University's Student Government Association on Monday. That same day, bananas hanging from nooses were found at three spots on campus in what the DC school's president calls a "crude and racially insensitive act of bigotry," per NBC Washington. The bananas—hung by an unknown individual around 4am Monday—were scrawled with phrases "Harambe bait" and "AKA free," a reference to Alpha Kappa Alpha, a predominantly black sorority of which Dumpson is a member, report NBC News and BuzzFeed. In a statement, the sorority says it is "outraged by a demonstration of racism" and calls for the university to protect its members. Others students have made similar appeals, but many accuse the school of doing little in response to the incident. The president of American's Black Student Alliance—who says students threw a rotten banana at her and also targeted another female student in September—says students just don't feel supported. "We shouldn't have to be begging for our existence to be validated on the campus that we pay to be on," she tells the Washington Post. Hundreds of students marched to the registrar's office and requested withdrawal forms in protest Tuesday, though American says "racist, hateful messages have no place in our community" and that it's investigating with police. A $1,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of the individual, seen in surveillance videos.

Story: – When it comes to sugar, Americans need to be a lot more careful, a study finds. Even two cans of soda a day can significantly boost the risk of death from heart disease. If a quarter of your daily caloric intake comes from added sugar—in processed foods, for instance—your risk of death from heart disease could be triple the risk faced by someone who gets less than 10% of her calories from sugar. What could get you to the 25% level? The AP give this example: a breakfast cinnamon roll, a super-sized soda at lunch, and ice cream after dinner. About 10% of adults hit that level; between 2005 and 2010, Americans got an average 15% of their calories from added sugar, Bloomberg notes. Researchers led by a CDC expert found that the dangers from sugar weren't just due to obesity: The threat exists for people of normal weight. The study reviewed national health surveys between 1988 and 2010; the researchers investigated data on some 30,000 people. Soda and other sugary drinks are the main problem, accounting for some 37% of the added sugar in an American diet. Desserts and fruit drinks make up much of the rest. (Sugars found naturally in fruits and vegetables weren't classified as "added sugar.") Says an expert who write an editorial accompanying the study in JAMA Internal Medicine, "Too much sugar does not just make us fat; it can also make us sick."
Summary: 1. What is the main finding of the study regarding the relationship between sugar intake and heart disease risk?2. How much sugar intake is considered "dangerous" or "high risk" according to the study?3. What are the main sources of added sugar in the American diet, according to the study?4.

Story: – A 5-year-old boy with leukemia has a wish: He wants to be Batman. So the Make-a-Wish Foundation asked for help from San Francisco residents, and more than 7,000 have signed up so far. They'll help stage a series of stunts on Friday, during which little Miles will get to rescue someone in trouble on a cable car, chase the Penguin, capture the Riddler, and be thanked (and given a key to the city) by the mayor and the police chief at City Hall. The thousands of people who signed up will form crowds of bystanders who will cheer Batman on. "Since he wants to be a superhero, we felt like having a large crowd there waiting with signs and cheering him on would make him feel like a hero," a Make-a-Wish manager tells ABC News. It's the foundation's biggest event yet, Mashable reports, and some of the volunteers are flying into the city specifically to take part. Foursquare and Twitter are also getting involved: Participants can check in at "Gotham City" on Foursquare, and Twitter has set up an account for the Penguin—who is, of course, using it to taunt "Batkid." DC Comics may even give him his own comic book.

Story: – Three days after Tristan Beaudette was fatally shot inside his tent while camping with his two young daughters at Malibu Creek State Park, there was another shooting at the California campground. The second shooting happened around the same time Beaudette was killed—4:45am—on Monday morning, police say, but they are so far not linking the two incidents. Meliss Tatangelo tells CBS News her vehicle was also shot last year while she was sleeping in it at the park, and James Rogers tells the Los Angeles Times he was hit with bird shot from a shotgun while in a hammock at the park two years ago; no suspect was ever identified. Authorities are investigating several earlier unsolved shootings at the park, though they won't say how many; the campground where Beaudette was killed is closed until further notice. Meanwhile, officials still don't know who killed Beaudette and whether he was targeted or shot randomly. His brother tells CBS there were two holes in his tent, one in the top and one in the side, but police have not confirmed whether those were bullet holes. Campers reportedly told first responders the shot came from a distance away from the campsite, but authorities have also not confirmed that. A GoFundMe set up for Beaudette's family has so far raised more than $114,000.

Story: – She's a klutzy transplant to the Oregon town of Switchblade who falls for a computer geek with nosebleeds named Edwart. “Looking into his eyes I felt waves of electricity, currents of electrons charging towards me. Was this how it felt to be in love ... for robots?” Yes, it's Belle, but this is Twilight as reimagined by the wits at the Harvard Lampoon—four current students who undertook Nightlight, the Lampoon's first satire of a novel since Bored of the Rings 40 years ago. The thin volume drops today—conveniently just weeks before the next installment of the film series hits theaters, the Los Angeles Times notes. Hoping to borrow a little of the buzz from the über bestseller and box office smash? Poppycock, the Lampoon’s 22-year-old editor tells the Wall Street Journal.

Story: – A bill to ban abortions nationwide after 20 weeks cleared a House panel today on a party-line vote of 20-12. While it doesn't stand a chance in the Senate, it will give House conservatives a chance to make a point when that chamber votes as early as next week, reports AP. Today's vote, however, got overshadowed when sponsor Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican, said this while criticizing an amendment to make an exception for rape or incest: "You know, the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low." Democrats immediately likened the comment to Todd Akin's gaffe that "legitimate rape" rarely caused pregnancies, reports the Hill. Franks later clarified: He intended to make the point that rape rarely causes the pregnancies that result in the later-term abortions he wants to ban, and the issue is therefore irrelevant to his bill. However you parse it, both Dave Weigel at Slate and Jonathan Chait at New York say Franks is no Todd Akin. Unlike Akin, Franks "didn't say it's hard to get pregnant when you're raped," writes Chait. "He said rape-induced pregnancy doesn't happen very often," and that's a big difference. Given that 30,000 such pregnancies occur each year, plenty of people might disagree with Franks' statement. But to a staunch opponent of abortion like Franks, that number may seem small when compared to the far higher number of abortions annually. At Atlantic Wire, Elspeth Reeve has a less-forgiving view of Franks' comments.

What are the potential consequences of Franks' bill, both for women's reproductive rights and for the broader social and political landscape?7. How does Franks' statement fit into the larger cultural narrative around rape and sexual assault, and what impact could it have on efforts to address these issues?8. How does Franks' approach to the issue of rape-induced pregnancies contrast with other politicians and advocates who are working to address the issue of sexual assault and reproductive rights?9. What are the ethical implications of Franks' statement, both for him as an individual and for the broader political discourse around this issue?10.

Story: – If you can't stop fidgeting, Matthew and Mark McLachlan say they have just the thing for you: Fidget Cube, which an ad helpfully explains is "a cube that you fidget with." The tiny desk toy—which has buttons to push, a ball to roll, a dial to spin, and a switch to flip—was Kickstarter's fifth-most lucrative project ever, though it's been open to backers for only two weeks, reports the Guardian. The McLachlan brothers originally planned to raise $15,000 for the cube—designed to satisfy "common fidgety impulses" like pen clicking and nail biting "without driving your colleagues and loved ones away"—but crushed that goal within a day. The project has now raised $4.6 million with 30 days left and the brothers are "working overtime" to figure out how to get the $19 product—complete with an indentation designed "to reduce anxiety when rubbed"—out to its first 100,000-plus backers by December, per CNET. "There was once a time where we had planned on shipping your order personally" using "any family members who would accept payment in the form of pizza," the team writes in an update. "This doesn't appear to be possible anymore." Orders placed now are expected to be delivered around March, the brothers say. (Backers also loved this jacket that charges your phone.)

Story: – Today's jobs numbers fell just slightly below the expectations of economists: 155,000 jobs were added last month, when 160,000 had been expected, the Wall Street Journal reports. The unemployment rate held steady at 7.8%; last month's initial rate of 7.7% was revised upward. Some observations from the AP: Though jobs numbers were below expectations, the "steady gain" proves that hiring continued even during the fiscal cliff negotiations in DC. But the average number of jobs added monthly in 2012—153,000—was the same as that in 2011. Construction and manufacturing added 30,000 jobs, the most in 15 months, reflecting the rebuilding efforts after superstorm Sandy. "Hiring should be stronger this far into a recovery," writes Kathleen Madigan in the Journal.

Story: – President Trump addressed the 19th national Boy Scout Jamboree in West Virginia on Monday and extolled the values of working hard and never giving up. But he also strayed from those Scout-like subjects into the realm of politics, hitting on familiar topics such as "horrible ObamaCare," the "fake media," the DC "cesspool," and his victory over Hillary Clinton. Here's the full transcript. Some highlights: Big moments: The Toronto Star rounds up 17 "jaw-dropping" moments in the speech to kids, including when he joked about firing his health secretary if ObamaCare repeal failed. (He also singled out West Virginia's Sen. Shelley Moore Capito.) More standard advice: "So as much as you can, do something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you're going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful." Clinton: He spoke of working hard in the campaign, particularly in Michigan. "You know, my opponent didn't work hard there because she was told she was going to win." (The crowd booed her.) Obama: “By the way, just a question. Did President Obama ever come to a jamboree?” Trump asked, triggering boos. Obama had never attended because of policies against gay Scout masters, notes the New York Times. A question from Trump: "Who the hell wants to speak about politics when I'm in front of the Boy Scouts? Right?" Cocktail party: Trump regaled the Scouts with a story about attending a cocktail party in the 1980s and meeting famed housing developer William Levitt, whose career was on the wane at the time. Why? Because, and this was the lesson, he'd taken time off and "lost his momentum." The Week has a video clip. Election night: "But you remember that incredible night with the maps, and the Republicans are red and the Democrats are blue, and that map was so red it was unbelievable. And they didn't know what to say." Too political? Some current and former Scouts thought so, with reactions rounded up at Time. Trolled: Pete Souza, Obama's White House photographer, continued his not-so-subtle Trump trolling by posting this image of Obama with a Boy Scout. Obama, he writes, wasn't telling the boy "about his electoral college victory."

Story: – Critics are applauding Transparent, the new 10-episode series that's putting Amazon Prime in the spotlight. Multiple reviews call the show, which tells the story of a family whose patriarch has begun living as a woman, "transcendent": It's touching, believable, and extremely funny. Among the comments: "Start hitting up your friends for that Amazon password now," writes Willa Paskin at Slate. "To call (Transparent) Amazon’s first great series, or the only great series of the new fall season—both of which are true—is to damn it with faint praise." Members of the show's Pfefferman family "are all so recognizably human, that despite their idiosyncrasies—or rather, because of them—they have the feel of archetypes, characters that dozens of other characters from here on out will be like." In Time, James Poniewozik calls the show the year's best. "Transparent understands that families are not simply collections of personalities but have collective personalities themselves," he notes, and the show "often feels like it was transcribed more than written." And "did I mention that it’s freaking hilarious?" "The plot has a very small footprint—it's just this family, really—but the ideas it covers are really huge," writes Margaret Lyons at Vulture, calling the show "near perfect." It's "a crystalline bird's nest, beautiful and fragile and a little bit dreamy and magical, where you hatched and from whence you're obligated to fly away." In the Los Angeles Times, Mary McNamara does offer some criticism: The show's "biggest flaw is (creator Jill Soloway's) determination to give each of her children equal attention, which means everyone's in some state of crisis or another and they all talk about it way too much." But Jeffrey Tambor, in the lead role, offers "a master class in acting," and Transparent is, "quite simply, astonishing to watch."

Story: – For the first time in the 43-year-long history of DC's annual March for Life, White House officials attended the event. Vice President Mike Pence promised the crowd Friday that "life is winning again in America," and noted that there is a "pro-life [majority]" in Congress. He said the outlook for the anti-abortion movement is better than it has been since Roe v. Wade, and promised that marchers would see action from President Donald Trump as soon as next week. That's when Trump plans to nominate someone to replace Antonin Scalia in the Supreme Court, and Pence said that the nominee would share Scalia's anti-abortion stance. Presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway also addressed the crowd, telling marchers, "This is a new day, a new dawn for life," as they chanted her name. She added that the Declaration of Independence guarantees a "right to life. It is a right. It is not a privilege. It is not a choice. It is God-given." The Fort Worth Star-Telegram notes that, though no former president or VP has ever attended the march, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush addressed marchers via video. Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Sen. Jodi Ernst, R-Iowa, also addressed this year's crowd, reports Fox News. There is no official estimate on the number of attendees yet.

Story: – Bloated running times, terrible performances, a 60-pound weight gain—there are a host of reasons why even the most well-known actors are sometimes cut from films. The Huffington Post takes a look at 11 notable instances of big names getting axed from big movies: Ryan Gosling, The Lovely Bones: Gosling thought his character should be big, so he gained a lot of weight and showed up to filming weighing 210 pounds. Unfortunately, the filmmakers, who cast him at 150 pounds, disagreed and fired him. James Gandolfini, Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close: Gandolfini was supposed to be a love interest for Sandra Bullock's character, but test audiences hated his scenes. Mickey Rourke, Billy Bob Thornton, Gary Oldman, Viggo Mortensen, and Martin Sheen, The Thin Red Line: That's a whole lot of star power to get left on the editing room floor, but that's what happened with this Terrence Malick film. At least Rourke ended up in the Blu-ray's deleted scenes. Maya Rudolph and Amy Poehler, Anchorman: The rambling Will Ferrell classic simply had too much footage, so Rudolph's and Poehler's scenes were edited out. Don't feel too badly for them, though, as director Adam McKay was able to put them in a second film with the leftovers, Wake Up, Ron Burgundy. Click for the full list, including one film the Huffington Post calls "a hilarious Hollywood mess."

Story: – Just imagine "Jay-Z" as a triple word score: A new edition of Scrabble will bring with it a change to one of the game’s cardinal rules—proper nouns will be legal. Mattel won’t regulate which names are allowed or introduce any rules governing spelling, it’ll just let players work it out for themselves, reports the BBC. But traditionalists shouldn't fear, notes CNET: That change and others (such as backward words and stealing letters) will only be in a version sold as Scrabble Trickster. The company said it expects existing fans to enjoy the change, but it appears to be extremely wrong. The head of the London Scrabble League tells the Express that Mattel is “tarting up” the game, predicting that serious Scrabble players will keep using the classic rules. In the Telegraph, another tournament player called it “an act of desperation by the makers, who have presumably noticed that younger people can not spell, read or write.”

Story: – It's not often the whole US feels serious winter weather at once—but that's what's happened over the past few days, meteorologists say. "This literally spreads across the entire US, and we're 12 days from the official start of winter," one tells CNN. Yesterday, 2,800 flights were canceled, the AP reports; today, the number is almost 1,500. Meanwhile, Anchorage, Alaska, is seeing warmer temperatures than St. Louis; the Midwest has wind chills of 40 degrees below zero; and Philadelphia had a daily record snowfall of about eight inches yesterday (another one to three could come tomorrow), requiring snowblowers during an Eagles-Lions game. Federal agencies had two-hour delayed openings in Washington, which could see another three to five inches tomorrow, NBC News notes. Some 20,000 remain without power around Dallas-Fort Worth. At least seven people have died in connection with the storms in Arkansas, New Mexico, and Texas, mostly in car accidents. New Jersey saw two killed in a road accident; the Pennsylvania Turnpike suffered a 50-car pileup in the wake of a fatal accident. Forty were injured in a New York pileup.

Story: – An Iranian women's soccer star is being forced to miss a tournament in Malaysia this week because her husband, an Iranian sports journalist, is refusing to sign paperwork to renew her passport, Yahoo Sports reports. Iranian law allows husbands to forbid their wives from traveling outside the country, according to the AP. "I am only a national soldier who fights to raise flag of our country," Niloufar Ardalan, known as "Lady Goal," wrote on Instagram yesterday. "I wish a law would be approved that allows female soldiers to fight for raising the flag." Ardalan's husband, Mahdi Toutounchi, is refusing to let her attend the tournament, which starts tomorrow, because he doesn't want her missing their son's first day of school. "This just shows to what extent this law can impact a woman's life," Iranian women's rights advocate Shadi Sadr told Radio Free Europe. "Even if a woman reaches the highest ranks in politics, sports, or culture, she still needs her husband's consent for one of her most basic rights—traveling abroad." While Ardalan claims foreign media is exaggerating her situation, she did call on Iran to change the law, according to the AP. "I wish authorities would create [measures] that would allow female athletes to defend their rights in such situations," Yahoo reports the midfielder telling an Iranian news agency. And she isn't alone, as many other Iranians sent message of support through social media.

Story: – Despite her tears and public apologies, former Korean Air exec Cho Hyun-ah is facing criminal charges from South Korean prosecutors over her meltdown on a Dec. 5 flight out of New York, the BBC reports. According to a government investigation, Cho (also known as Heather Cho) became enraged when a flight attendant brought her macadamia nuts in a bag, not on a plate, so she screamed at him and demanded the plane be brought back to the gate to dump him. The crew chief also talked to local media and said that Cho cursed him out and jabbed him with a document folder, Reuters reports. Although Cho, the daughter of Korean Air CEO Cho Yang-ho, has since resigned from all posts, notes CNN, Seoul officials want to charge her with inflight violence and changing a flight route, the Guardian reports. Other people could also face repercussions: A current exec with the airline with the surname Yeo is being investigated for alleged attempts to cover up what happened, the Guardian notes; when the flight attendant in question was interviewed for the investigation, Yeo sat right next to him. And it hasn't gone unnoticed that most of the transport ministry officials now looking into the case have been employed by Korean Air at some point; separately, the BBC notes that one official was arrested today for allegedly leaking details of the investigation to Korean Air. A detention warrant for Cho was requested this morning, meaning the court thinks the accused might skip town or mar evidence, Reuters notes. (One fringe benefit of "Nutgate": Macadamia sales in South Korea have surged.)

Story: – John McCain, unlike some other leading Republicans, can accept Donald Trump as the party's nominee—but there's still the matter of those POW comments. McCain tells CNN that he will support Trump, but before he will appear on a stage with the candidate, who joked last year that he preferred war heroes "who weren't captured," Trump needs to "express his appreciation" for "veterans who were incarcerated as prisoners of war." "I'd like to see him retract that statement. Not about me, but about the others," says McCain, who was tortured during the six years he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. He says Trump offended a "body of American heroes" with the remarks last year, the New York Times notes. McCain did, however, say that other party leaders should also support Trump because, like him or not, he is the choice of GOP voters. "You have to listen to people that have chosen the nominee of our Republican Party," he says. "I think it would be foolish to ignore them." McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, says he aims to steer Trump toward a foreign policy that resembles that of Ronald Reagan—and he believes Trump could be a "capable leader," though probably not on a par with Reagan. (Out of the other four living GOP nominees for president, both Bushes have declined to support Trump, Bob Dole endorsed him on Friday, and Mitt Romney not only doesn't consider him a Republican, he might still be open to running against him.)

Story: – An atheist group in Ireland thinks a new law against blasphemy is "silly and dangerous," and it's using everyone from Jesus to George Carlin to support its case. The Atheist Ireland website has put up 25 quotes it says would run afoul of the 2-day-old law, which forbids "publishing or uttering matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters sacred by any religion." Those convicted face a fine of about $35,000. The group hopes to challenge the law in court, notes the Guardian. On its list is one from Carlin: "Religion easily has the greatest bullshit story ever told." Bjork: "Fuck the Buddhists." Jesus, telling Jews: “Ye are of your father the devil." And, of course, Frank Zappa: "To hang all this desperate sociology on the idea of The Cloud-Guy who has The Big Book, who knows if you’ve been bad or good ... that, folks, is the chimpanzee part of the brain working.”
Summary: 1. What is the purpose of the new law against blasphemy in Ireland, and who is it intended to protect?2.

Story: – The White House has officially responded to a Washington Post report that President Trump was advised "DO NOT CONGRATULATE" in his briefing materials but congratulated Putin on his re-election win all the same, though the White House is not out with a confirmation or denial. Instead, its official statement is as follows: "If this story is accurate, that means someone leaked the President's briefing papers. Leaking such information is a fireable offense and likely illegal." The AP notes it's not known whether Trump read the document prior to his Tuesday call with Putin; it reports National Security Adviser HR McMaster did brief him in advance of it. CNN's sources describe a furious Trump and a furious John Kelly as well, with both men incredibly upset over the leak. Per CNN, it's a pretty small circle that would have seen the briefing papers and the advice within. In a CNN column, Chris Cillizza echoes that, noting the leaker claimed the president also ignored advice to bring up the poisoning of Sergei Skripal on the call. "That level of information suggests a closeness to the President that doesn't come from some junior staffer popping off. This feels like a purposeful leak at the highest levels of presumably the national security apparatus," he writes, and that's what really matters about this story, he says. "Because a White House—any White House—in which the confidential details of a call between the President of the United States and the President of Russia leaks out hours after it happens is a dysfunctional one."
Summary: 1. Who leaked the briefing materials to the Washington Post, and why?2. What was the contents of the briefing materials that President Trump was advised not to congratulate Putin on his re-election win, and why was this advice given?3. How did President Trump respond to the briefing materials, and did he ignore the advice given?4. Who briefed President Trump in advance of his call with Putin, and what was the nature of that briefing?5. Why is it significant that the leaker claimed the president also ignored advice to bring up the poisoning of Sergei Skripal on the call?6.

Story: – The roads in Connecticut and New York City will be empty tonight: Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy instituted a travel ban for the entire state beginning at 9pm tonight at a morning news conference on the looming blizzard, saying, "It's imperative that you have a plan in place to get home safe this evening." On Twitter, his office runs down the latest: Snow is expected to be "intermittent" through the late afternoon then hit hard, with accumulation totals potentially reaching as high as 32 inches. Snow drifts could rise to 4 feet in height, and winds along the coast could hit 60mph. Other official reactions to the storm bearing down on the Northeast: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says roads will be closed to all non-emergency vehicles by 11pm, the AP reports, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo says subway service will be limited after 7pm. In New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie has declared a state of emergency, urging people to "please stay home and stay off the roads," CNN reports.

Story: – It is time to break the "historic cycle of mistrust" between police and minority groups in America, the leader of America's biggest association of police chiefs said at the group's annual meeting in San Diego Monday, offering an unprecedented apology. There is much to be proud of in the history of law enforcement, but policing has also "had darker periods," International Association of Chiefs of Police President Terrence Cunningham said, per CNN. "There have been times when law enforcement officers, because of the laws enacted by federal, state, and local governments, have been the face of oppression to far too many of our fellow citizens," said Cunningham, chief of police in Wellesley, Mass. To move forward, Cunningham said, it will require "the law enforcement profession and the IACP to acknowledge and apologize for the actions of the past and the role that our profession has played in society's historical mistreatment of communities of color." The San Diego Union-Tribune reports that civil rights leaders have welcomed the apology, but they'd like Cunningham to clarify whether he's talking about the 19th century, the 20th century, or last week. "What specific action of the past is he referring to?" wonders Andre Branch, head of the San Diego chapter of the NAACP. "Excessive force? Illegal stops by law enforcement? Fatalities of African-Americans in police encounters?"

Story: – Estefania Isaias was banned from entering the US after getting illegal visas for her maids—a ban that was lifted right around the time the Isaias family donated tens of thousands of dollars to President Obama's campaign, the New York Times reports. The family has given vast sums to several US politicians, including New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, who fought to overturn the ban. Meanwhile, the US has rejected calls to extradite Estefania's father and uncle, Roberto and William Isaias, who have been sentenced to prison in Ecuador in what the country calls a $400 million case involving fraud by their bank. Menendez pushed hard with the State Department on behalf of Estefania after the travel ban was enforced. He announced the ban's reversal a day after her mother donated $40,000 to the Obama Victory Fund in 2012. The family also gave Menendez's 2012 campaign more than $11,000, NBC New York reports. Menendez's office says the senator "handled this case no differently than we have thousands of other immigration-related requests over the years," and that he often works on out-of-state cases. But the Ecuadorian ambassador calls the move on behalf of a foreign national "quite unusual." As for the brothers, the criminal case against them was questionable, the Times notes, and the US says extradition requests haven't fulfilled legal requirements. Click for the Times' full piece.

Story: – Over four days in early May, three dead great white sharks washed ashore in South Africa—with their livers missing. Researchers with the Dyer Island Conservation Trust did necropsies and came to the conclusion that, based on the sharks' injuries, orcas likely killed them and ate their livers, the researchers write on the Marine Dynamics blog. In the case of one of the sharks, the heart was also eaten. As LiveScience explains, it's not unprecedented for killer whales to hunt great whites, but it's also not known to be typical. Orcas are known, however, to hunt broadnose sevengill sharks and eat their livers, and other marine mammals—including sea lions—are known to hunt smaller sharks and eat their livers and other organs, leaving the rest of the carcass behind. What's so appealing about the liver? Sharks don't have a swim bladder to keep them buoyant, so they have "very large" livers that are filled with fats to give them buoyancy, a biologist explains. The livers are also "very energy- and nutrient-rich," he says. As Newsweek explains, they also contain high levels of squalene, a hydrocarbon used to produce steroids and hormones.
Summary: 10. What are some potential implications of this discovery for the conservation of great white sharks and their ecosystem?11. How does this information about orcas' feeding habits affect our understanding of the complex relationships between different species in the ocean?12. Are there any potential applications of this knowledge in the field of marine biology or conservation?
Story: – Tributes are pouring in for the career of the late Whitney Houston, after her shocking death yesterday, focusing on her uniquely powerful voice and incredible catalogue of hits. A sampling: "At her peak, Houston was the golden girl of the music industry," praised Billboard.

Story: – We've all been told sugar rots the teeth—but the brain as well? A new study has linked blood sugar levels even at the high end of normal to shrinkage of parts of the brain involved in memory and emotions, reports ABC. The "robust" link between blood sugar and brain shrinkage suggests that the definition of a normal blood sugar level might need to be changed, and that controlling blood sugar levels could help boost the brains of even non-diabetics, say the researchers. The study involved hundreds of Australians in their early 60s, and the link remained even when factors such as drinking, smoking, and obesity were taken into account. The lead researcher says that while the study has no explanation for how high blood sugar can shrink the brain, the stress, poor diet, and lack of exercise associated with high blood sugar is likely responsible for poor brain health. More research needs to be done before any recommendations can be made based on the study, says a neurologist not involved in the research. "To speak as a clinician and tell patients that they better cut out all candy because it will shrink their brain is a leap of faith," he tells WebMD, but there's a simple way to have a healthy brain. "It's just what all of our mothers told us: Eat well and exercise," he says. "That's a principle we would all do well to live by."
Summary: 1. What specific parts of the brain were found to shrink due to high blood sugar levels in the study?2.

Story: – The Pittsburgh Penguins and their fans offered a nice show of support to Canada last night before a game against Philadelphia. Hours after a gunman attacked the Parliament in Ottawa, fans joined along in the singing of O Canada as the Canadian flag was projected on the ice, reports ABC News. The Canadian anthem typically isn't sung when a game features two US teams, but the Penguins decided to make an exception. It caught the attention of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, notes the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Story: – Some big retailers in Australia aren't stocking Grand Theft Auto V on the grounds that it's misogynistic and sends a bad message to kids. As a result, gamers have started a petition of their own to stop sales of the Bible—on the grounds that it's misogynistic and sends a bad message to kids. "It's a book that encourages readers to murder women for entertainment," reads the petition at Change.org. The petition asks, straight-faced, that Target stores in Australia stop selling the Bible, and it had collected more than 27,000 signatures as of today. Target and Kmart Australia are among Aussie chains that have bowed to advocacy groups and opted not to sell the game, notes the Hollywood Reporter. “Kmart apologizes for not being closer to the content of this game," says a company statement picked up by ABC News of Australia. Critics cite clips such as one described by Bloomberg/Businessweek that “features a first-person character who picks up a sickly looking hooker on the street, has sex with her in his car, then gets annoyed with her chattering and punches her in the face before before running her over and driving away.” Gamers point out that GTA's rating means it can't be sold to minors.

Story: – By watching that episode about a rabid anti-dentite, you're indirectly supporting a (alleged) rabid anti-Semite. Fusion reports new Donald Trump strategy chief Steve Bannon gets royalties every time a rerun of Seinfeld is aired. Back when he was an investment banker, Bannon's firm was involved in Ted Turner's purchase of Castle Rock Entertainment, as Bloomberg reported last year. His firm waived its full fee at the time, instead agreeing to take a stake in five shows, one of which was Seinfeld.

Story: – Hillary Clinton at last broke her silence on Syria today, offering a cautiously positive US response to Russia's proposal that Syria turn over its chemical weapons stockpiles, Talking Points Memo reports. Clinton, who said she'd just spoken with President Obama about the day's events, said that: If the regime immediately surrendered its stockpiles to international control ... that would be an important step. But this cannot be another excuse for delay or obstruction. And Russia has to support the international community's efforts sincerely or be held to account. Kerry had initially appeared to forward the same idea, but the State Department then walked it back as merely a rhetorical statement. Clinton added that these negotiations "only could take place in the context of a credible military threat by the United States." Clinton also reiterated Obama's position that the Assad regime's "inhuman use of weapons of mass destruction against innocent men, women, and children" demanded "a strong response." But she said the US was ultimately best served by a political solution along the lines negotiated last year in Geneva, CNN reports.

Story: – Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, not surprisingly, want to maintain control over the footage of West proposing to Kardashian. (You'll almost certainly see it on a reality show near you in the not-too-distant future.) So now that it has leaked, they're suing. They say YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley showed up at San Francisco's AT&T Park uninvited, but was with an invited guest and was allowed to stay after signing a confidentiality agreement—which he was even photographed holding. Then he violated the agreement by posting a two-and-a-half-minute video on MixBit in an attempt to promote his "new but foundering business," the lawsuit claims, according to the Hollywood Reporter. But it's not all bad news for the Kardashian clan this week. Lamar Odom recently refuted rumors of marriage problems for him and Khloe Kardashian, in no uncertain terms: "We're wonderful. We're unbreakable," he told Us. "That's why I wear my wedding ring. It is a beautiful ring. From a beautiful wife." The most entertaining Kardashian-related news, however, is that the Honey Boo Boo clan donned Kardashian costumes for Halloween. Honey Boo Boo herself played Kris Jenner, Mama June played Kim; it's worth checking out the picture on TMZ.

Story: – This can't be good: Hackers breached the security networks of top US defense contractors, reports Reuters. The story has no details on what, if anything, the hackers got, and points out that any highly classified work would likely be out of reach on a closed government network. But it's possible that some details on future weapons systems as well as weapons in use today in Iraq and Afghanistan were compromised. Lockheed Martin got hit for sure, and it looks like General Dynamic, Boeing, Northrup Grumman, and Raytheon were exposed by the same vulnerability. The hackers got in by figuring out a weakness in the "electronic key" system designed by the RSA security division of EMC Corp. A big part of the problem in cases like this is all those people logging in from home and on the road, outside the office firewall, notes Phil Wainewright at ZDNet. "Some say that the right response to cloud threats is to completely isolate the corporate network from the cloud," he writes. "But that’s not realistic in today’s connected world." Security threats are the price we pay for that convenience, and we're going to have to deal with it. (The news comes on the heels of the big breach at Sony.)

Story: – Ta-Nehisi Coates can now add a National Book Award to his growing list of accomplishments: The journalist, who was recently given a MacArthur genius grant, has won the National Book Award for nonfiction for Between the World and Me, his look at race and policing in America, written as a letter to his teenage son. Coates dedicated the award Wednesday to his friend Prince Jones, who was killed by a police officer who confused him with a criminal 15 years ago; the officer was never punished. "Between the World and Me comes out of that place," Coates said, per the Los Angeles Times. "Every day you turn on the TV and you see some sort of violence being directed at black people." The AP calls the best-seller "among the most uncompromising works in recent memory to gain such a wide following," adding it's "well on its way to a lasting place in American letters." The fiction award went to Adam Johnson for his short-story collection Fortune Smiles. Johnson—who won the Pulitzer Prize for his 2012 novel The Orphan Master's Son, per the New York Times—was so shocked that he remarked, "I told my wife and my kids, 'Don't come across America because this is not going to happen.'" Hanya Yanagihara's A Little Life and Lauren Groff's Fates and Furies were also finalists. Neal Shusterman won the award for young people's literature for Challenger Deep, about a teen's struggle with mental illness, while Robin Coste Lewis won the poetry award for Voyage of the Sable Venus. Don DeLillo, 78, won a lifetime achievement medal, and James Patterson—who's donated $2.75 million to school libraries and bookstores—was awarded for his outstanding service to the literary community. All winners took home $10,000.

Story: – Syrian forces ambushed a group of rebels outside Damascus yesterday, killing 175 belonging to the Islamist extremist al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, according to state news agencies, per the Wall Street Journal. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights counted 152 dead—mostly foreigners from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Chechnya—in the raid it says was carried out by Hezbollah, which would still make the casualty toll "one of the largest in a single operation reported during much of the almost 3-year-old war," the Los Angeles Times reports. It would also mark "a significant advance" for Bashar al-Assad's efforts, Reuters notes. Rebels and opposition activists in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta suburb, however, say the toll is much lower, and most of those killed were civilians. One activist says 40 fighters were killed, while another Islamic rebel group puts the number at 45, most of those civilians. The Journal notes that there are contradictions, too, between state news reporting and Hezbollah's media arm, Al Manar, which says fighters were leaving the area. Syrian state media contends that rebels were entering it through southern Syria from Jordan, where they stocked up on weapons. Al Manar, meanwhile, posted video of rebels walking in a line before explosions hit and gunfire followed those trying to escape. The rebels' intended path may have been lined with land mines, the Times notes, meaning the military may have had word of the rebels' plans.

Story: – A bathroom at a Kroger in Athens, Ga., is the unlikely subject of much attention since a customer posted a photo of its unisex bathroom notice to Facebook over the weekend. The sign reads, in part, that the store is opting for a unisex bathroom because "we have a lot of our friends coming to see us," and goes on to list those who can benefit from a more inclusive policy, including dads with daughters, moms with sons, and those in the LGBTQ community. Business Insider reports that Kroger is getting "widespread praise" for the sign, while the Facebook post had been shared almost 90,000 times as of Tuesday morning. Mashable notes that many businesses are taking sides in the ongoing debate in Georgia over banning or upholding anti-discrimination laws, and while Time notes that Kroger has not yet responded with a comment, the Huffington Post points out that the sign actually uses language from a similar bathroom notice posted at Pure Pizza restaurant in Charlotte, NC, earlier this year. (Georgia's governor vetoed its "religious liberty" bill on Monday.)

Story: – When a woman took legal action over a reported firing linked to breastfeeding, courts dismissed the move—in part because men are capable of lactating, the Raw Story reports. Now, the Supreme Court is letting that dismissal stand. "The court's reasoning in this case echoes old Supreme Court pronouncements that discriminating against pregnant women at work isn't sex discrimination because both men and women can be non-pregnant," writes Gale Sherwin of the ACLU, noting that "Congress long ago rejected this ridiculous reasoning." Angela Ames took action against Nationwide Insurance after she came back from maternity leave and had no place to pump milk, the ACLU reports. An office "lactation room" apparently required paperwork that took three days to process. Instead, the company nurse said, Ames could use a sick room, but she'd have to wait until it was free, writes Sherwin. In the meantime, her supervisor said that she'd need to get all the work she missed done within two weeks to avoid facing discipline, Sherwin writes. As Ames grappled with pain in her breasts, which had started to leak, she talked to her department head, who suggested that she "just go home and be with (her) babies." Ultimately, the department head dictated a letter of resignation for Ames to sign, Sherwin notes. In dismissing the case, courts held that Ames hadn't taken proper internal action before resigning and hadn't technically been fired. A trial court deemed the "be with your babies" comment was gender-neutral, Sherwin adds. While the department head was a woman, the federal appeals court that rejected discrimination claims, MSNBC notes, was made up of three men. (Delta recently apologized over a breast-pump mishap.)

Story: – Russia has begun launching airstrikes in Syria for the second straight day despite US concerns, reports the BBC. The Kremlin insisted again Thursday that the strikes are against terrorists, reports Reuters, though the US isn't buying it. American officials say Vladimir Putin is going after rebels trying to overthrow Moscow ally Bashar al-Assad, not ISIS, and the New York Times reports that one of the groups hit Wednesday was in fact trained by the CIA. The Washington Post characterizes US officials as in a "scrambled" response to the fast move by Putin—which came after just an hour's notice—and sets things up thusly: The White House said it "would not be bullied into supporting President Bashar al-Assad and that it was about to significantly expand its own Syrian air operations." John Kerry and Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov had lengthy talks Wednesday, and military officials might meet as early as Thursday. Also: Kerry: "It is one thing, obviously, to be targeting ISIL. We are concerned, obviously, that is not what's happening." Lavrov: "Don't listen to the Pentagon about the Russian strikes." Potential for trouble: "Right now you've got the aircraft of the Syrian air force, the Russian air force, and the US-led coalition operating in a very confined area," a military analyst tells CNN. "These are high-performance aircraft—lots of weapons, lots of people on edge when they're flying these missions." 'New Cold War': "Syria has been threatening to become a proxy battleground for what some are calling the New Cold War for months," and the Russian airstrikes "may have tipped the balance," per an analysis at CNBC. It suggests that Putin might eventually "have to compromise on his support" for Assad and work with the West, but that's still palatable for him "if Syria was brought back into ... the Russian sphere of influence, and if he could say with confidence that the IS threat had been lessened." Who's doing the fighting: The New York Times has an explainer about the convoluted agendas in Syria, involving not just the US and Russia, but Saudi Arabia, Iran, France, Britain, and others.

Story: – The most populous county in Texas got hit with some "black girl magic" on Tuesday—which is why you'll now see a whole bunch of proud female African-American judges on the bench going forward. While much of the nation was hyperfocused on another race in Texas—that of Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz for a US Senate seat—19 black women ran for judge in Harris County on Election Day, and all 19 of them emerged victorious, per the Guardian and BuzzFeed News. The women (dubbed the "Houston 19," per the BBC) all stumped together under the "Black Girl Magic" slogan, posing for a pre-election photo and spurring a hashtag of the same label. The Guardian notes that although just 30% of the state's populace is white men, that demographic makes up nearly three-fifths of state court judges, which is why those newly elected Harris County judges say this development is so significant. "Having an African-American judge or having a female judge—those are the kinds of things we bring to the bench," Latosha Lewis Payne, now judge-elect for the 55th Civil Judicial District, tells FOX 26. "We bring an understanding of a person who may come from that similar background." The BBC lists all 19 winners. (What may be in the cards for Texas' most high-profile politician this year: Beto O'Rourke.)

Story: – The days of the white-throated snapping turtle (Elseya albagula) appear to be numbered, according to the Australian government, which has recently declared them critically endangered. If that isn't attention-grabbing enough, consider that the animal prompted a biologist to talk like this: "These turtles breathe out of their ass, which is super awesome." That's James Cook University researcher Jason Schaffer, who's spent eight years studying the turtles in a habitat where dams, agriculture, and predation are making it increasingly difficult for them to survive, reports Scientific American. One of Australia's largest freshwater turtle species—which can live to be 100—white-throated snapping turtles do indeed possess an unusual skill: cloacal respiration, by which they extract oxygen from water via their backsides, reports James Cook University. Thanks to dams, though, water is becoming too sluggish for this kind of breathing, bringing the reptiles to the surface, where they're vulnerable to predators, and restricting them from traveling to find mates. And their eggs take seven months to hatch, which is plenty of time to be eaten or trampled. "Almost nothing is surviving," Schaffer says. "There is nothing coming up to replace them. Pretty soon we'll blink and there will be no more left." (It turns out turtle shells predate dinosaurs.)

Story: – Before longtime North Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith died last month, he made an unusual arrangement in his will: All of his former players are getting $200 to go out to dinner, reports ESPN. The letter to one such player, Dante Calabria, surfaced today on Twitter. "Enjoy a dinner out, compliments of Coach Dean Smith," it reads. The check is enclosed. FoxSports reports that Smith sent letters to about 175 ex-players, meaning he shelled out about $35,000. "It put a tear in my eye," says former team member Serge Zwikker.

Story: – Federal investigations of Hillary Clinton almost played an even bigger role in this election than they already do, insiders say. Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that by February of this year, FBI agents thought they had enough evidence to investigate whether Clinton Foundation donors improperly received favorable treatment from the State Department when Hillary Clinton was in charge. Senior Justice Department and FBI officials, however, rejected the evidence—including a secret recording of a suspect in a corruption case talking about deals Bill and Hillary Clinton allegedly made—as insufficient, the sources say. The investigation began after the publication of the book Clinton Cash by conservative writer Peter Schweizer, notes the Journal and the New York Times. The book looked at "ethical challenges," including money that flowed to the Clintons after the Russian purchase of a uranium company. Essentially, the book asserted that foreign entities who gave money to the foundation got special treatment by the State Department. CNN reports that the field agents—who also allegedly uncovered a possible suspicious transaction involving a Clinton Foundation donor—were repeatedly told by the Justice Department there wasn't enough evidence for the investigation to proceed, and any issuing of subpoenas or similar steps should not be made until after Election Day. The issue has reportedly caused an escalating feud between FBI agents and federal corruption prosecutors. (President Obama has spoken out on the FBI's handling of Clinton's latest email issue.)

Story: – Two Minneapolis police officers are on leave due to their ill-advised Christmas ornament choices. A photo of the Fourth Precinct's Christmas tree made headlines after being shared on social media last week; the tree was decorated with items including a Newport cigarette pack, a can of Steel Reserve malt liquor, police tape, bags of Takis and Flamin' Hot Funyuns, and a Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen soda cup in what longtime civil rights activist Ron Edwards called a "wink wink" to racist tropes. "It’s a modern-day version of a dog whistle," he says, per the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The items were placed on the tree as a prank after it was decorated, CBS Minnesota reports. The Star Tribune notes that the North Side precinct has "struggled to rebuild community trust" since the fatal 2015 shooting of Jamar Clark, an unarmed black man, which sparked major protests. More protests have been launched since the Christmas tree, which has since been taken down entirely, came to light. Mayor Jacob Frey said an internal investigation has been opened into the "racist display," and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo said he was "ashamed and appalled." A police rep says the officers involved have been "relieved of duty" but are still being paid pending the results of the investigation, KARE reports.

Story: – Indianapolis police trying to find out who murdered Amanda Blackburn on Nov. 10 have ruled out her husband, Davey, and on Friday they announced a breakthrough: a picture of the suspect. The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department released two photos Monday night, captured by a neighboring home's security camera, the Indianapolis Star reports. Cops say the suspect—who has a slight-to-medium build, stands between 5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 9 inches tall, and was wearing light-colored pants and a hoodie—looked like he was trying to hide his face as he entered the Blackburns' home. "It was such an obscure photo and it's extremely difficult to say that anybody recognized it," Davey Blackburn said Tuesday morning during a Good Morning America appearance, per Fox59. "Our neighborhood was so close ... this has devastated all the neighbors." As the police implore the public to come forward with any information that could help crack the case, they're releasing more details. The suspect is believed to have left the area in a dark-colored SUV, which police think contained multiple stolen TVs, WRTV reports. A memorial for the slain 28-year-old, who was 12 weeks pregnant, was held Sunday night at a nearby church, and more than 2,000 showed up to pay their respects, the Star reports. Davey Blackburn, meanwhile, said he was "baffled" by his wife's murder—"Amanda didn't have an enemy in the world"—and that the worst part for him is knowing their 15-month-old son, Weston, will grow up without his mother. "She was the perfect mom," he said, per Fox59. "I wish every mom in the world could've learned from her."

Story: – French train passengers were in shock today when a train rolled into a station with a bicyclist's dead body pinned to the driver's carriage, AFP reports. The high-speed train apparently hit the 48-year-old cyclist at a village crossing and carried it 25 miles to Mulhouse station. Police found the bicycle and examined the body, but couldn't say whether it was suicide or an accident, the Daily Mail reports. Meanwhile, train staff and passengers received counseling for emotional trauma. "The body was found, stuck to the front right of the train, out of the driver's vision," said a national rail company spokesman, who described such incidents as "relatively rare." True, but a high-speed train (which can reach 200mph) did once strike a minivan without the driver noticing, Metro reports. "The kinetic energy of a train is so great that a shunt could go unnoticed," said the spokesman. "If there isn’t any debris left on the sides upon impact, you wouldn’t be aware of it." (Read about a mom who saw a train hit a car with her toddler inside.)

Story: – A former National Guard soldier in Virginia was arrested Sunday and charged with attempting to plan a terrorist attack in the US with the help of ISIS, the AP reports. According to WTVR, 26-year-old Mohamed Jalloh, a US citizen from Sierra Leone, joined the Army National Guard in 2009; he was honorably discharged in 2015. He allegedly quit after hearing a lecture from a radical Muslim cleric. The FBI believes Jalloh first made contact with ISIS during a trip to West Africa in 2015, NBC Washington reports. An investigation into Jalloh started in March after an ISIS member introduced Jalloh to a government informant posing as an ISIS operative. That ISIS member, now dead, was planning an attack in the US and believed Jalloh and the informant would help. In April, Jalloh allegedly told the informant he was thinking about conducting an attack similar to the one on Fort Hood in 2009, saying he wanted to do a "Nidal Hasan type of thing." Officials say that same month he was asked by ISIS if he wanted to take part in an attack and responded, "I really want to." "Sometimes you just have to take action," NBC quotes Jalloh as allegedly saying during a recorded conversation. In May, officials say Jalloh told the informant he wanted to plan an attack for Ramadan, which ended Tuesday, and tried to send $500 to ISIS. He was seen buying an assault rifle on Saturday (the gun was disabled before it left the store). Jalloh's arrest was the culmination of a three-month sting. He's facing 20 years in prison if convicted.

Story: – Bradley Manning's pre-trial hearing rolled on today with witnesses testifying about lax US military security and a scuffle Manning had with a fellow soldier, CNN reports. Prosecution witnesses said Manning, an "outcast" in his Iraqi unit, should have lost his security clearance after assaulting a female intelligence analyst, the Guardian reports. But "he was very good in researching and compiling data," Capt. Casey Fulton testified. Manning even pinpointed his unit's computer as the source of video that had leaked online showing a military helicopter attacking civilians in Iraq, Politico reports. “He sent me email with links to the shared drive of two video clips," Fulton said. Witnesses also described a laughably relaxed security atmosphere at the unit, where soldiers played video games, movies, and music on "secure" military computers. The hearing at Fort Meade, now in its third day, lets prosecutors argue that Manning fed top-secret data to Wikileaks and should face a full military trial.

Story: – "Affluenza" teen Ethan Couch has dropped an appeal against deportation and will return to Texas to face charges in the coming days, said his Mexican lawyer Tuesday. "I gave him several options, but he decided to go to Texas to face whatever charges he faces," said attorney Fernando Benitez, adding that Couch formally ratified his decision to drop the appeal on Monday. The appeal had led to a court injunction against Mexico's original decision to deport Couch, reports the AP. Since then, he has been held at an immigration detention center on the outskirts of Mexico City. Benitez expected a judge to close the case Tuesday, noting that would clear the way for Couch to return to Texas. "Once the injunction is removed, they will deport Ethan in 24 or 48 hours," said Benitez, who put it succinctly in an email to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram: "Should be sent back ASAP." He said Couch had decided not to continue with the constitutional appeal after "he reviewed the basis of the appeal in Mexico," and because "it was in his interest" to do so. Upon his return to Texas, Couch will be held in a juvenile detention center. A juvenile judge will hold a hearing to decide whether to continue to hold him there, book him into an adult jail, or let him go, said Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson. A separate hearing is scheduled for Feb. 19 to determine whether Couch's case will be transferred to the adult system.

Story: – At least 28 people are dead after an explosion struck three military vehicles and a civilian vehicle Wednesday in Turkey's capital of Ankara, CNN reports. Another 61 people were reported injured. According to the BBC, most of the victims are believed to be Turkish soldiers. The vehicles were stopped at a traffic light near Turkey's parliament during the evening commute when a car bomb exploded nearby, Al Jazeera reports. The blast could be heard around the city. Multiple officials, including Turkey's deputy prime minister, are calling the attack the work of terrorists. The country is becoming a popular target for ISIS, with multiple deadly explosions in the past months. While no one has claimed responsibility for the attack, Turkish officials believe it was possibly carried out by the Kurdistan Worker's Party. "Our determination to respond in kind to attacks taking place inside and outside our borders is getting stronger with such acts," the BBC quotes a statement from Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following Wednesday's attack.

Story: – A 5-year-old boy is missing in California, and police say his father, who was found passed out in a park when he was supposed to be in charge of the child, is unable or unwilling to give them helpful answers. Police in South Pasadena took Aramazd Andressian Sr. into custody and extensively searched Arroyo Park for the boy, Aramazd Andressian Jr., after the father was found unconscious near his vehicle early Saturday morning, the Los Angeles Times reports. The boy's mother, who's separated from Andressian Sr. and shares custody, called police the same morning after he never showed up to drop the boy off. She says she last saw the boy in a Skype conversation on Tuesday. The little boy is 41 inches tall, weighs 55 pounds, and was last seen wearing a turquoise shirt and plaid shorts. He has a small mole on the bottom of his right shoulder, police said in a Facebook post. "When we found out the boy was missing, we don't know if he crawled out of the car himself, if he walked away, if he was abducted—we have no idea," South Pasadena Police Chief Art Miller said Saturday, per ABC7. Andressian Sr. has been arrested on suspicion of child endangerment and child abduction. Police, who haven't disclosed whether they think the father may have harmed the boy, says his story is "all over the place" and he seems to have a "very selective memory" about what happened to his son.

Story: – Two people already in custody on suspicion of child abuse, torture, and mayhem are now being investigated for homicide after the bodies of two young children were found in a California storage unit Monday, the New York Times reports. The Plumas County Sheriff's Office arrested 17-year-old Gonzalo Curiel and 39-year-old Tami Joy Huntsman on Friday in Salinas, Calif. Per KSBW, the victim in the original incident is a young girl who is alive but "fighting for her life" after being "severely abused." The Times reports the bodies of two other children were found in the storage locker about 300 miles from Salinas in Redding, Calif. The deceased children—ages 3 and 5—were siblings, KSBW reports. Their relationship to the third victim or the suspects is unclear. According to the Sacramento Bee, police searched an apartment in Salinas on Monday. And a post on the Redding Police Department's Facebook page simply states the bodies were discovered after "further investigation." The identities of the children are not being released, and an autopsy is pending on the two found in the storage locker, the Bee reports.

Story: – Not only the sins of the father, but the weight of the mother may well also be laid at the feet of the children. So report researchers out of Sweden in the journal PLoS Medicine in finding that women whose BMI increases by two or more units—amounting to a roughly 12-pound gain in women of average height—between their first and second pregnancies pass on considerable risk to their second-born child. Scientists analyzed data on more than 525,000 second-born babies and found that the risk for all negative outcomes goes up, including seizures, a severe breathing condition involving choking on meconium, and asphyxia. And it all adds up with obesity at "epidemic proportions," including among pregnant women. "Encouraging women to normalize BMI before pregnancy and to avoid weight gain between pregnancies is likely to be an important measure to improve infant health," the researchers note in a press release. In fact, the risk of babies born with a low Apgar score rose sharply by between 33% and 78% when born to a woman who'd gained this much weight between pregnancies, the researchers found. The increase in risk was most pronounced among women who were at a normal weight, or BMI of less than 25, at the start of their first pregnancy and then gained weight between the two, reports Medical Daily. It adds that the study is "strong" in that it analyzes so many births and outcomes, but notes that the authors don't know how much weight was gained during pregnancy or when women gained weight between pregnancies. (Obesity also ups the odds of big babies.)
Summary: 1. Can you explain the definition of BMI and how it is calculated?2. How did the researchers define "weight gain between pregnancies"? Was it based on a specific amount of weight gained or a percentage of weight gained?3. What were the specific negative outcomes that the researchers found to be associated with weight gain between pregnancies? Can you provide some examples?4. How did the researchers control for other factors that could influence the relationship between weight gain and negative outcomes, such as maternal age, smoking, and alcohol consumption?5. What was the sample size of the study and how did the researchers ensure that the sample was representative of the population?6. How did the researchers account for the fact that obesity is a complex condition that can have many causes beyond just diet and exercise?7. Can you explain the concept of "epidemic proportions" as it relates to obesity? How does this term differ from other terms used to describe the prevalence of obesity?8. How did the researchers determine the threshold at which weight gain between pregnancies became associated with increased risk of negative outcomes? Was it based on a specific percentage of weight gain or a certain amount of weight gained?9. Can you provide some context for the finding that the risk of babies born with a low Apgar score rose sharply by between 33% and 78% when born to a woman who gained weight between pregnancies? How does this compare to the risk of low Apgar scores in babies born to women who did not gain weight between pregnancies?10. How does this study fit into the broader literature on the impact of maternal obesity on fetal health? Are there any limitations or inconsistencies in the existing research that this study helps to address?
Story: – A Florida school district is under fire this week after court filings seem to show it blaming four third-grade girls for their molestation at the hands of a teacher 12 years ago, People reports. In court documents, lawyers for the school district wrote that the four girls "were old enough to appreciate the consequences of their own actions and to be held accountable for them … Through their actions and/or omissions, plaintiffs conducted themselves in a careless and negligent manner … and such negligence was a contributing and/or sole proximate cause of their injuries and damages.” The news comes as the school district is expected to approve a $3.6 million settlement with the four women at a meeting this week. The women say their teacher Blake Sinrod groped them and forced them to touch him in 2005, when they were around 9. In 2006 Sinrod pleaded guilty to child abuse charges involving two of the girls. After the girls' parents discovered Sinrod had been accused of crimes before, they sued the Palm Beach School District for negligence in 2006. The district's defense was written by Hollywood law firm Conroy Simberg, and a lawyer with the firm called it "comparative negligence," a common defense use to raise issues that might lower the amount of damages the school district should pay, the Sun-Sentinel reports. “We have never blamed these girls or given the appearance of holding the girls responsible for what their teacher did," Simberg says.

Story: – If the toilet had been on solid ground, it likely would've been fixed in a jiffy. But there was no quick fix for the toilet trouble that plagued a Norwegian flight over the weekend—despite scores of plumbers being on board. After departing Oslo, Norway, for Munich, Germany, on Saturday, a Boeing 737 carrying roughly 85 plumbing tradesmen—all but 20 employed by the same plumbing company—had to do a U-turn at the Swedish border because of a toilet issue, reports the Independent. "We would have liked to fix the restrooms, but unfortunately it had to be done from the outside and we didn't risk sending a plumber to work at 10,000 meters," a plumber aboard the flight says, per the Independent. Another saw "good humor" in the situation. The problem was eventually rectified back in Oslo without the plumbers' help. The flight then departed again for Munich, arriving about 3.5 hours later than scheduled, per the Telegraph. (This remains one of the craziest toilet stories Newser has covered.)

Story: – Megyn Kelly's deeply controversial interview with Alex Jones aired Sunday night—and although a sizable chunk of her Sunday Night segment on Jones and his Infowars media operation was devoted to explaining why NBC would give airtime to a man who has claimed the Sandy Hook mass shooting was a hoax, some critics were unconvinced. "Here's the thing, Alex Jones isn't going away," Kelly said, who noted that praise for President Trump has helped expand the conspiracy theorist's influence. Jones leaked audio of his conversations with Kelly days before the broadcast. A roundup of coverage: Jones failed to provide a straight answer when Kelly, who said she would deal with his "notorious lie," pressed him on his Sandy Hook claims, the AP reports. He claimed to have been playing "devil's advocate" when he said the shootings were faked, but also said there was "cover-up and manipulation" surrounding the massacre and some of the footage "looks like a drill." The light that Kelly promised to shine on Jones turned out to be a "dim bulb at best," according to Lorraine Ali at the Los Angeles Times. She says Kelly asked tough questions but failed to push for answers, noting that when Kelly asked Jones about his claim that the people killed in the concert attack in Manchester last month were "liberal trendies," Jones delivered a "senseless word salad of an answer" that Kelly failed to follow up. Jack Shafer at Politico disagrees, saying Kelly gave Jones a "pantsing," taking him apart in a "textbook manner." "Short of waterboarding him, I don’t know what more Kelly could have done to expose Jones’ dark methods," he writes, adding that despite outrage over the interview, dealing straight-on with people like Jones is more effective than pretending he doesn't exist. Kelly was "out of her league" in the interview, according to Don Kaplan at the New York Daily News. "Sure, she looked tough as she grilled Jones, but Kelly delivered no news," he writes. "She did not move the story of this monster forward, nor provide anything aside from a shallow profile of a frightening, sweaty, tin-foil-hat-wearing nutjob." The interview "fell flat," but it wasn't a disaster and Jones didn't run rings around Kelly the way some feared he might, Maya Kosoff writes at Vanity Fair. "Whether the interview was worth NBC's week of grief is another question," she adds.
Summary: 1. What was the purpose of the interview, and how did it align with Kelly's goals and NBC's editorial stance?2. How did Jones' behavior and responses during the interview reflect his personality and reputation, and how did he handle the tough questions posed by Kelly?3.

How did the interview fit into the larger context of Kelly's career and legacy as a journalist, and how did it compare to her previous interviews or reporting?7. What were some of the ethical considerations or challenges that Kelly faced during the interview, and how did she navigate them?8. How did the interview reflect the broader cultural and political landscape, particularly in terms of the rise of conspiracy theories and the role of media in shaping public discourse?9. What were some of the potential consequences of the interview for Jones and his media outlet, both in terms of public perception and legal or financial repercussions?10. How did the interview contribute to a larger conversation about the role of journalism in holding powerful figures accountable and the challenges of covering controversial or polarizing topics?
Story: – The superintendent of Marion County schools in Florida has just issued a "no homework" mandate for the district's 31 elementary schools starting this fall, reports WESH 2. Superintendent Heidi Maier cites research that nightly homework assignments haven't been shown to directly impact a child's academic advancement, and wants parents to instead "assist your child in self-selecting their own text that inspires them" and spend 20 minutes a night reading to or with them. "This is so important for many reasons," she told parents over a call. The homework ban will apply to Marion County's 20,000 elementary school students, but not to middle or high school kids. Maier is an expert on reading acquisition and has run the district since November, reports the Washington Post. One reading acquisition expert chimes in that while "some kinds of homework might raise achievement," it's "uncommon in US schools," where the "quality of homework assigned is so poor" that replacing it "with self-selected reading [is] a more powerful alternative." Homework has been debated for generations, with the Ladies' Home Journal once calling it "barbarous" and some educators saying it causes heart disease in children who would be better served by playing outside. (One school in Massachusetts banned homework last year.)

How might the "no homework" policy impact the relationship between parents and teachers, and what steps can be taken to ensure that parents are engaged and supportive of the policy?10. What are some potential implications of this policy for other schools and districts across the country, and how might it influence the broader national conversation around homework and student learning?
Story: – Keri Young was nearly halfway through her pregnancy when she and her husband learned that the girl she was carrying was terminally ill. Suffering from anencephaly, the fetus was developing without parts of her brain, and in almost all cases these babies die within a day or two of birth, reports the New York Daily News. But in a Facebook post that has gone viral, the Oklahoma woman wrote that she has decided to carry Eva to term, and that she'll "donate anything she can and do more in her time on earth than I ever will." Young says she made the decision when her previous doctor called to tell her it would be the most selfless thing she'd ever do. Now husband Royce, a writer for ESPN, has penned a follow-up Facebook post that has also gone viral about how his wife has been "in the trenches," feeling every kick and hiccup. "She's cut from a different cloth, combining wit, beauty, courage, silliness, character and integrity into one spectacular woman," he writes. He tells CNN it would be "irresponsible" to not share Eva with others in need, and adds that "choice can mean life." He says they're private people, but tells Huffington Post that they won't get to "brag about her grades or how pretty her hair is; this is what we get to tell people about." Doctors say that Eva's heart valves, kidneys, and liver can be donated to others, and her lungs to research. Her due date is May 7. (One man's donated heart stays in the family, by chance.)

Story: – Amazon is raising its minimum wage for all employees to $15, a bump that could have implications throughout the US workforce. The raise, effective at the start of next month, will cover 250,000 workers and 100,000 seasonal employees, reports the Wall Street Journal. The company has been under fire from critics—notably Bernie Sanders—for making a fortune while paying its warehouse workers so little that they often need federal assistance, notes CNN. Amazon says it will also lobby to have the federal minimum wage increased from its current $7.25 per hour. "We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead," says CEO Jeff Bezos, who Reuters notes is the richest man in the world with a net worth of $150 billion. "We’re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us." The move comes amid a national push to have fast-food restaurants and other blue-collar employers pay workers $15 an hour. Target, for example, plans to reach that figure by 2020, and Disneyland and Disney World by 2021. Walmart, which has 1 million workers, raised its minimum wage to $11 earlier this year.

Story: – New developments in the Miss America scandal that forced out the organization's CEO and other executives after "unacceptable" emails were revealed about past winners. One of the most vocal critics of the pageant's leadership after the revelations was Gretchen Carlson, a past Miss America winner and former Fox News host, and now Carlson is set to assume an important new role: She'll be serving as chairwoman for the Miss America Organization's board of directors, the AP reports. Carlson, who won the title in 1989 as Minnesota's representative, will be the first ex-pageant winner to head up the group, which was established in 1921. Three other past winners (Laura Kaeppeler Fleiss, 2012's victor), Heather French Henry (2000), and Kate Shindle (1998) will also take seats on the board, all effective immediately, per HuffPost. It was HuffPost's Yashar Ali who first revealed in December the internal emails exchanged among ex-CEO Sam Haskell and other board members. The emails referenced Shindle and 2013 winner Mallory Hagan, referencing their appearance, sex lives, and intelligence with what HuffPost calls "misogynistic and inappropriate language." Haskell initially called his correspondence "a mistake of words" and said he wouldn't step down, though he eventually did. Carlson, who tweeted Monday she was "honored" to take the helm, told HuffPost in a statement: "Everyone has been stunned by the events of the last several days, and this has not been easy for anyone who loves this program. … We appreciate the existing board taking the steps necessary to quickly begin stabilizing the organization for the future." (One ex-Miss America wants the entire board to step down.)

Story: – In a surprise announcement Monday, Walmart revealed it was closing two stores in Texas, and three others in California, Florida, and Oklahoma, for six months for "extended repairs" to plumbing. Some 2,200 employees were told they would be out of work just hours before the stores shut their doors around 7pm, CNNMoney reports. "Everybody just panicked and started crying," says a manager at one of the closed stores in Pico Rivera, Calif., who wonders whether the closure is actually punishment for employee protests for higher pay. Some employees from other closed locations are also suspicious, though a Walmart rep tells the Consumerist plumbing is the problem and "we aim to reopen these stores as soon as these issues are resolved." "This is the first time we're hearing of their sewer problems," says Pico Rivera's city manager. The Pico Rivera store was a hub of the pro-union OUR Walmart movement and the first to stage a walkout over wages in 2012. A plumbing technician at the now-closed Brandon, Fla., location tells WFLA that "it wouldn't take six months to replace a whole sewer line in that store." WFTS reports that Walmart hasn't applied for plumbing permits in any of the five affected cities; Walmart says that's because it isn't yet sure what repairs are necessary. Workers, who can attempt to transfer to another location, will be on paid leave for just two months. Full-time workers may be eligible for severance if they don't find another Walmart post before June 19, but that's not an option for part-time employees.
Summary: 1. What is the reason behind Walmart's decision to close these stores for six months? Is it due to plumbing issues or something else?2. How many employees will be affected by the store closures, and what will happen to their jobs? Will they be able to transfer to other locations or will they be laid off?3. What is the history of the stores that are being closed? Have there been any previous issues with plumbing or other problems?4. How did the employees find out about the closure? Were they given advance notice or were they told just hours before the stores shut their doors?5. What is the response from the employees and the local community to the closure? Are they supportive of Walmart's decision, or do they have concerns about the length of time the stores will be closed?6. How does this closure compare to other store closures Walmart has made in the past? Are there any similarities or differences in the reasons for the closures?7. What is Walmart's plan for addressing the plumbing issues in the affected stores? Will they be hiring outside contractors to fix the problems, or will they handle the repairs in-house?8. How will the closure of these stores affect the local economy in the areas where they are located? Will there be any impact on other businesses in the area, such as suppliers or competitors?9. What is the timeline for the repairs and when can the stores be expected to reopen? Will they be reopening in phases or all at once?10. How will Walmart ensure that the repairs are done properly and efficiently to minimize the impact on employees and customers? Will they be hiring a third-party inspector to monitor the progress of the repairs?
Story: – A century ago, there were more elephants in Africa than there were people in New York City. Now there are probably more people in Anchorage than elephants in Africa, with the pachyderm population down by a third just between 2007 and 2014, according to the biggest-ever study of elephant populations. The Great Elephant Census found 352,271 savanna elephants roaming across 18 countries and estimated that the population had dropped by 144,000 in a seven-year period, with poachers slaughtering tens of thousands every year for ivory to sell to the Chinese market, NPR reports. The researchers, whose work is published in PeerJ, warn that the population is dropping by 8% every year as poaching continues and that localized extinction is on the horizon in several countries. Elephant ecologist Mike Chase is the founder of Elephants Without Borders and the lead scientist on the elephant census, which spent three years trying to count Africa's elephants from the air. "I don't think anybody in the world has seen the number of dead elephants that I've seen over the last two years," Chase tells CNN, describing how poachers have been wiping out entire family herds of elephants, and how areas that once supported thousands of elephants are now home to just tens. "If we can't protect the world's largest land mammal, the prognosis for wildlife conservation is bleak," he says, though there is hope that the census will aid the creation of a master plan for protecting elephants. (US zoos, meanwhile, are letting their elephants die out.)

Story: – A Syrian rebel has been caught on video apparently cutting a dead soldier's heart from his body then taking a bite from it. "I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog," says the rebel, identified by Human Rights Watch as noted rebel figure Abu Sakkar of Homs. HRW calls the act a war crime, and Syria's leading opposition coalition has promised a trial, the BBC reports. "The mutilation of the bodies of enemies is a war crime. But the even more serious issue is the very rapid descent into sectarian rhetoric and violence," an HRW rep tells Reuters. Sakkar is seen telling his followers to "slaughter the Alawites"—Assad's sect—"and take their hearts out to eat them" in an unedited clip, the HRW spokesman says. The video hasn't been independently authenticated, reports note. Sakkar has appeared in other videos from the Syrian crisis, including one in which he poses with the corpse of a fighter with Hezbollah, which is supporting Syria's government, HRW notes. RT News has blurry, though graphic, images from the video.

Story: – A man has been charged with murder in the slaying of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee in Chicago. The Cook County state's attorney's office identifies the boy's alleged killer as Corey Morgan, 27, per the Chicago Sun-Times. The Chicago Tribune calls him "a reputed member of the Terror Dome faction of the Black P Stones" gang. He had earlier been named as a person of interest. Police say Tyshawn was killed in retaliation for the Oct. 13 murder of Morgan's 25-year-old brother; police previously said Tyshawn's father had gang ties but his connection to that killing isn't clear. Morgan's mother was also shot in the arm during the Oct. 13 attack, reports the Sun-Times. Police say Tyshawn was "lured" into an alley on Nov. 2. An autopsy shows he was shot in the right temple, and that the bullet exited his left. He was also grazed in the back, right forearm, and right hand. At a press conference Friday, police said Morgan and one other person are in custody and a third person is still being sought in connection with Tyshawn's murder, CNN reports. Police say Morgan was first questioned two days after Tyshawn's murder, then arrested on Nov. 17 after he was spotted leaving a Hilton Hotel with another man, Dwight Boone-Doty, 21, who allegedly had a .40-caliber pistol tucked in his waistband. Police pulled the pair over a few blocks away and allegedly found another pistol in a bag Morgan was carrying outside the hotel. Morgan—who was charged with possessing a firearm as a felon, previously convicted of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon—was ordered held on $1 million bail for that alleged crime but later posted the required 10%, a move that "drew gasps from the courtroom gallery," the Sun-Times noted at the time. Morgan (who is a construction worker, per his lawyer) got the $100,000 from his girlfriend, who received a large court settlement in a suit against a hospital, according to police. "He says he had nothing to do with Tyshawn Lee's execution," his lawyer now tells NBC Chicago. "The entire city wants the person who did this caught but it's not Corey." (A Chicago model was killed on the same day Tyshawn was murdered.)

That, and a few sparse details, is all that State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert would offer Monday night on the death of an unnamed US diplomat on the island of Madagascar, NBC News reports. "We are deeply saddened to confirm that a US Foreign Service Officer was found dead in their residence in the early morning hours of Friday, September 21," Nauert said in a statement, adding that a joint probe with US and Madagascar authorities was underway and that there would be no further comment for now. A local police rep tells AFP a man "was caught trying to jump the perimeter fence fleeing from the house." ABC News notes a State Department travel advisory from July warns that Madagascar "has experienced a dramatic spike not only in the number of crimes, but also in their severity and type, including armed attacks, robberies, and assaults," and that while "the majority of reported crimes were directed at Malagasy nationals … Westerners have likewise been targeted."

Story: – Philadelphia police are on the hunt for an anonymous Instagram user who claimed to "expose rats" by identifying witnesses of violent crimes. Posting more than 150 pictures, plus police statements and testimony, the "rats215" account has named more than 30 witnesses since February in a city where finding people to testify is already challenging, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Though the account has almost 8,000 followers, police were only clued in to the leaks last week, the AP reports. The account warned witnesses, "we will get at you in time," while comments from followers included messages like, "Post some new rats. I needa put a hit out on them." The account, which included witness statements from one man who said he was shot at for testifying in a homicide case, now appears to have been shut down. How the account got the info, some of which should have been secret, isn't clear, but followers were asked for paperwork on suspected "rats." Search warrants on the account have been granted. "People feel they can hide behind a name," says an officer. "These actions shoot an arrow through the heart of the criminal justice system, placing victims and witnesses at risk. It's a challenge we're facing and a challenge we're attempting to work through."

Story: – A Republican candidate for Arkansas state legislature says it's time to crack down on rebellious kids—by threatening them with the death penalty. Instituting the punishment "would be a tremendous incentive for children to give proper respect to their parents," writes Charlie Fuqua, a former lawmaker, in his book, God's Law: The Only Political Solution. But he's certainly not going overboard: The penalty "would rarely be used." In his argument, he cites Bible passages describing "the guidelines for administering the death penalty to rebellious children." The Arkansas GOP and two US representatives, Tim Griffin and Steve Womack, have offered their financial support to Fuqua, though Griffin and the party's chair have criticized some of his statements, notes the Arkansas Times. In the book, Fuqua also supports deporting all Muslims. A book by Republican state Rep. Jon Hubbard, meanwhile, labels slavery "a blessing in disguise." State GOP chair Doyle Webb says the books are "highly offensive." But Fuqua's not so sure: "I think my views are fairly well-accepted by most people," he tells the AP.

When Lauer asked if she were worried that would look like an admission of guilt, she replied, "I look at it as an admission of innocence, to be quite honest. … It's common sense not to go back." At the same time, Knox said she thought her legal team would prevail. When Lauer asked if she'd thought about the fact that a conviction would leave her unable to safely leave the US, she replied, "I think about it all the time. It's so scary. Everything's at stake." She also said she hoped Meredith Kercher's family didn't believe she was guilty. "I don't want to be forever separated from them, because at this point Meredith is a part of my life." The trial is set to begin on Sept. 30, notes Reuters.

Story: – RedState.com editor Erick Erickson has finally endorsed a presidential candidate: The Sweet Meteor of Death, a joke candidate put forward by political blog Ace of Spades HQ. "You could presume that being a conservative of course I would choose something like a great fireball coming from the sky annihilating us all because women and minorities are hardest hit," Erickson quipped on his radio show.

Story: – Chemotherapy is "not pretty," a breast cancer survivor tells the AP—so a new study on women with early-stage breast cancer is encouraging, claiming a gene test can parse out patients who may be able to skip chemo because it won't ultimately provide much, if any, benefit. The study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that patients with breast cancer that hadn't spread to the lymph nodes and who qualified as "low risk" after taking a 21-gene test responded well to just taking hormone-blocking drugs and opting out of chemo, which can come with significant side effects. Per a press release, the patients who only received hormone therapy had a 98% survival rate after five years, with less than a 2% chance the cancer had spread. "We knew these patients were going to do well, but we didn't dream they would do this well," says lead author Joseph Sparano, per the Wall Street Journal. The trial involved 10,253 women with early-stage breast cancer, per the release. After taking the Oncotype DX gene test—sold by Genomic Health since 2004 and covered by many insurers, per the AP—17% were classified as a high risk for cancer recurrence, 67% as intermediate risk, and 16% as low risk. The high-risk group received chemo and hormone therapy, and the intermediate group hormone therapy by itself or with chemo (results from those two groups aren't out yet). But results for the low-risk group were significant enough to be publicized. A Memorial Sloan Kettering doctor not involved in the study is impressed, telling the AP "there is really no chance that chemotherapy could make [those numbers] better" and that genetic testing could help refocus chemo efforts on high-risk patients who need it instead of making those who don't go through the grueling process. (Chemo doesn't have to translate to baldness, either.)
Summary: 1. Can you provide more details on the 21-gene test used in the study and how it works? How accurate is it in determining which patients are low risk for cancer recurrence?2. How were the patients in the study selected for the different treatment groups (high risk, intermediate risk, and low risk)? What were the criteria used to determine risk level?3. Can you provide more information on the side effects of chemotherapy? How do the side effects of chemotherapy compare to the hormone-blocking drugs used in the study?4. How long has the Oncotype DX gene test been available, and how has its use in breast cancer treatment evolved over time? How many insurers cover the test?5. Can you provide more details on the results of the intermediate-risk group, who received hormone therapy alone or with chemotherapy? How do their results compare to the low-risk group?6. How does the study's findings align with current breast cancer treatment guidelines? Are there any plans to update these guidelines based on the results of this study?7. Can you discuss the potential implications of this study for breast cancer patients in different stages of the disease? How might the results of this study impact the decision-making process for patients and their doctors?8. How does the study's findings relate to the broader context of breast cancer research? Are there any ongoing or planned studies that could build upon these results?9.

How might this approach change the way chemotherapy is used in breast cancer treatment?10. What are the next steps for this research? Are there any plans to conduct further studies to confirm these findings or to explore the use of genetic testing in other breast cancer treatment settings?
Story: – Ford Motor Co. says it's moving all of its US small-car production to Mexico. Ford CEO Mark Fields confirmed the long-expected move Wednesday during an event for investors and Wall Street analysts, the AP reports. Ford already makes its Fiesta subcompact in Mexico, but its Focus and C-MAX small cars are made in suburban Detroit. Making them in Mexico would boost company profits because of low wages there. The company is building a new $1.6 billion assembly plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and will make small cars there starting in 2018. "Over the next two to three years, we will have migrated all of our small-car production to Mexico and out of the United States," Fields told investors. Donald Trump—who has threatened to slap a 35% tariff on cars from Mexico—slammed the Ford move while campaigning in Flint on Wednesday, the Detroit Free Press reports. "We shouldn't allow it to happen," he said, warning that the move would increase unemployment. "They'll make their cars, they'll employ thousands of people, not from this country, and they'll sell their [cars] across the border." The Detroit News, however, reports that Ford says the move will not cost any jobs at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, which is expected to switch to making Ranger pickups and Bronco SUVs.

Story: – This should get you in the Halloween mood: The cable channel Destination America says it will broadcast a live exorcism on the St. Louis residence that once housed the inspiration for the film The Exorcist at 9pm EDT on Friday. Catholic priests performed a series of exorcisms on a Maryland teenager known only as "Roland Doe," who was purported to be possessed by the devil, on the spot in 1949. But "no one has ever attempted to rid the lurking spirits and demons that inhabit this home—until now," the Discovery Communications-owned network says in a statement, per UPI. Not enough for you on the campiness level? "The worst-case scenario is that one of these entities will attach to someone," a TV producer tells the Chicago Tribune. She says a team—including a clergyman and a psychic—will move through the house, which will be set up with six cameras, and rely on Twitter users to inform them what's going on in other rooms. "It is dangerous," the producer adds, and the Catholic archdiocese of St. Louis apparently agrees. A bishop says the event won't technically qualify as an exorcism since "no exorcism can take place without the authority of the local Roman Catholic ordinary." Plus, "any attempt to use the solemn Rite of Exorcism as entertainment exposes all participators to the danger of future hidden satanic attack." The network notes, however, that it's "enlisted a qualified and trained bishop to perform the actual exorcism," and everyone involved has signed a waiver.

Story: – A married middle school assistant principal has been arrested in the murder of a pregnant teacher with whom he was allegedly carrying on an affair in a case that's shaken Baton Rouge, La. Instructional specialist Lyntell Washington, 40, was seven months pregnant and the single mom to a 3-year-old daughter, reports the Advocate. Washington's body was found badly decomposed in an irrigation ditch last week after her daughter prompted investigators to search for her "sleeping" mother, who she said was "in the lake" after "Mr. Robbie" hurt her. Robert Marks, 39, the assistant principal at Brookstown Middle Magnet School, was originally charged with kidnapping and abandoning Washington's daughter in a parking lot the night of the murder, but he's now charged with murder and infanticide. He has yet to talk. In a recent text message to Marks, Washington asked if he was trying to get out of his responsibility for "our unborn child," according to a police affidavit. One of Washington's friends tells WAFB that no one missed any clues: "It's just that he was just who he was and we had no way of seeing that or knowing that. Some people are masterminds at deception." The school, meanwhile, is reeling, with Superintendent Warren Drake releasing a statement that Washington "will be remembered for the impact she had on the many lives she touched through her work in our district." The Advocate notes that Washington, whom friends call generous with her students even if she was struggling, lived in a one-bedroom apartment, needed a new car, had no working computer, and was pursuing a master's degree in education.

How did these challenges affect her work and relationships?6. How did the school and community react to Washington's murder? What impact did it have on the students, teachers, and parents?7. What can be learned from the fact that Marks had been able to deceive so many people for so long? What are the implications of this deception for the community and society as a whole?8. How does this case highlight the importance of mental health support and resources for teachers and other professionals in the education system?9. What are the broader societal implications of this case, particularly in terms of gender roles, power dynamics, and the treatment of women in the workplace?10. How can we prevent cases like this from happening in the future?

Story: – Now that the Justice Department has accused Edward Snowden of espionage and theft and asked Hong Kong to detain him, what's the holdup? "No clear answer," says the Washington Post. In other words, the stuff that lawyers dream of—a byzantine tangle of legal complications surrounding Hong Kong's ability to do so, and one that will be followed by an even greater legal mess when the Justice Department eventually asks that he be extradited. The latter could take "years" to resolve if Snowden chooses to fight it, reports the Guardian. Of course, there's also the possibility that Hong Kong police don't know where he is, but to fix that, they'd just need to pick up the New York Times: It says that for a week now, he's been "staying in an apartment in Hong Kong’s Western neighborhood that is controlled by the Hong Kong government’s security branch." Snowden himself apparently asked to go there for his own protection "against a possible rendition attempt by the United States." Meanwhile, an Icelandic businessman says he's keeping a plane at the ready in China to zip Snowden away to Iceland at a moment's notice, notes Reuters.

Story: – Another day in the exciting life of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford: Today, he had the pleasure of standing before city council and 'fessing up to buying illegal drugs while serving as mayor over the last two years, reports the Toronto Sun. "Yes, I have," Ford admitted, after a long pause, under questioning from a council member. At another point, he added, "There might be a coat hanger in my closet," reports the Toronto Star. "I don't know what's left." What's decidedly not left: His previous confession to smoking crack. He spoke before the same council that is trying to figure out a way to run the city without any interference from Ford, who continues to rebuff their pleas to at least take a leave of absence.

Story: – The Orange County Sheriff's Office released a report Monday officially declaring the death of 2-year-old Lane Graves, who was grabbed by an alligator at Florida's Walt Disney World in June, an accident. The report also reveals the terrifying details of the toddler's final minutes of life: Lane, who was trying to build a sandcastle on the shore of the Seven Seas Lagoon at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa, leaned over to put wet sand into his bucket. Then his father, Matt Graves, heard a splash and saw an alligator grabbing Lane's head, the Orlando Sentinel reports. "I saw it come out to get him," Matt Graves told investigators, per Time. Matt Graves pulled on the alligator's snout, but he couldn't get Lane away before the gator pulled the boy underwater and swam off with him. The gator "just took off," Graves told investigators. A lifeguard heard screams and saw the gator with Lane as much as 25 feet from shore, and Matt Graves with blood "all over the right side of his face and right hand," per the report. Graves went to a local medical center and was found to have cuts on his hand from the gator's teeth, as well as scratches on his foot. The report also notes that at least one witness passed out after the gator attack, and another was so upset more than a day later that deputies offered counseling services.

Story: – Sarah Jessica Parker dashed the hopes of Sex and the City fans last week when she said a long-rumored third movie would never happen. “It’s over," she told Extra. "We’re not doing it." But as Vanity Fair recounts, the drama over the news seems to be only increasing. Kim Cattrall, aka Samantha, is taking much of the public blame for killing the movie, thanks to a Daily Mail account that portrayed her as holding out for so much in negotiations that Warner Bros. finally pulled the plug entirely. She denies any such thing, saying she never wanted to do the movie in the first place. "The only 'DEMAND' I ever made was that I didn't want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016," she tweeted. On Monday, she also said of Parker, "She could have been nicer," per People. Parker hasn't responded, but actor Willie Garson, who played Stanford Blatch, sure has. And he's clearly on Parker's side. In a tweet mocking Cattrall, he writes, "I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway." Actress Kristin Davis, aka Charlotte, doesn't take sides, but sounds wistful on Instagram. "I wish that we could have made the final chapter, on our own terms, to complete the stories of our characters," she writes. "It is deeply frustrating not to able to share that chapter ... with all of you." Cattrall elaborated further in response to a fan's post about the news. “I’ve moved on,” wrote the 61-year-old on Instagram. "My decision reflects where I am in my life & I can’t change that without being unhappy. I hope you’ll understand. Kim”

Story: – Mitt Romney tackled the "birther" issue in his first interview since announcing that he is exploring a White House run. "I think the citizenship test has been passed. I believe the president was born in the United States," Romney told CNBC, suggesting that his fellow Republicans should focus on more substantive issues. "The man needs to be taken out of office, but his citizenship isn't the reason why." Romney is well placed to comment on issues relating to citizenship and the presidency, notes Daniel Freedman at Forbes. The Romney family lawyers probed the issue in the '60s when his father, George Romney, was seeking the Republican nomination. The Michigan governor was born to American parents in a Mormon colony in Chihuahua, Mexico. Romney's opponents labeled him "Chihuahua George" but his eligibility for the presidency was never seriously challenged, Freedman notes.

Story: – A man who apparently slipped from the top of a waterfall in North Carolina is dead along with his would-be rescuer. Authorities say Joseph Hopkins, 23, and Davis Zinsenheim, 22, were visiting a resident of the Lake Toxaway area from Georgia on Tuesday when they decided to explore a waterfall on the property. Authorities say three people were at the top of a waterfall when Hopkins fell some 40 feet onto a ledge. Zinsenheim tried to help his friend but slipped and fell an estimated 150 feet to his death, reports the Asheville Citizen Times. Police received a call around 7:30pm, and it took 37 crew members about four hours to bring up both men, reports WYFF. Firefighters tell WLOS that a 100-foot ladder was used to get rescuers to the top of the falls. They then rappelled down to Hopkins and used a basket to lower him to a waiting truck. He was taken to a hospital but died on Wednesday. Zinsenheim was dead at the scene.

Story: – Apparently New York in flames was not enough. Now a quasi-official North Korean news agency has posted a new video—this one of the US Capitol exploding, NBC News reports. Intercut with images of North Korean artillery and missiles, the video also shows a target homing in on the White House. "The White House is caught in the panoramic sight of a long-range missile," reads a caption. "This hotbed of war is in the scope of a nuclear bomb blow." The video comes after months of alarming moves by Pyongyang. The North has tested a rocket and a nuclear weapon, threatened to nuke the US, and announced the end of the armistice that has kept peace on the Korean peninsula. One analyst blames the escalation on new leader Kim Jong Un's need to "prove himself" to North Korea's military: "My take is that it is overwhelmingly bluster for domestic reasons, not international ones," she says. (Click to see the video of New York being firebombed, accompanied by an instrumental version of "We Are the World.")

Beto O'Rourke won the Democratic primary for the Texas Senate race Tuesday, Cruz released a radio ad slamming O'Rourke for using a nickname given to him shortly after birth, per CNN.

Story: – The latest outpouring of community anger over a police shooting is taking place in Olympia, Washington, where two unarmed black stepbrothers were shot by a white officer after the shoplifting of beer. Both are hospitalized but expected to live. Hundreds marched peacefully from a park to city hall yesterday evening, reports AP. Late last night, however, a smaller, more aggressive group of protesters clad in black bandanas took to the streets, reports the Seattle Times. "After they made several rounds through downtown Olympia—the state’s capital and home to the Evergreen State College—officers fired flash-bangs and briefly clashed with marchers, who numbered several dozen, breaking up the demonstration," says the newspaper. The shooting of Bryson Tyler Chaplin, 21, and Andre Damon Thompson, 24, took place about 1am yesterday after police responded to a call from Safeway employees who said two men were stealing beer. According to the police account, officer Ryan Donald chased the suspects and opened fire after one of them assaulted with him with a skateboard. "They're very aggressive, just so you know," he told the dispatcher. Donald, who is on administrative leave as the investigation unfolds, wasn't injured. The Stranger website takes note of the earlier, peaceful march: "The police here have kept a very low profile during the protest. No riot gear, nothing; they were almost invisible. These might be the lessons learned from Ferguson."

Story: – Chris Christie's personal jam continues today—take a gander at the newspaper covers he woke up to—in light of the traffic-jam scandal that emerged yesterday. One of the more damaging revelations: The Sept. 9-13 lane closures on the George Washington Bridge, apparently ordered by Christie aides, caused major delays to rescuers dealing with medical emergencies, according to a letter obtained by CNN. The day after the first huge jams in Fort Lee, NJ, the EMS director penned a letter to the town's mayor asking for help in altering the "new traffic pattern," which had made minutes-long trips three times longer; forced an ambulance to jump a curb to evade traffic while trying to get to a car accident with multiple injuries; impeded the search for a missing 4-year-old girl; and delayed responders en route to an unconscious 91-year-old woman who later died in the hospital. More fallout: Christie says he knew nothing about the scheme, but we should find out more about what he did and didn't know today: He has a press conference scheduled for 11am EST, reports NBC News. This could end up being a legal mess. The Record believes Christie's office may not have complied with a public records request it filed Dec. 17—and it's now weighing its legal options. The Record specifically requested any documents tied to the September lane closures, including those between David Wildstein of the Port Authority (he's a Christie appointee, and ordered the lanes closed) and Governor's Office officials. Ten days later, the Record was told the office "has not identified any records that are responsive to your request." One of the emails released yesterday (obtained by Assembly Democrats via a subpoena) between Wildstein and senior aide Bridget Anne Kelly (more on that email here) clearly qualified as responsive, says the Record. NJ State Sen. Ray Lesniak yesterday called on the US attorney for his state to convene a federal grand jury to review whether any criminal acts had occurred. When the Democrat was asked by the Star-Ledger what might make the list, he replied, "Abusing governmental authority for political purposes, for political gain." On a lighter note, NJ.com notes that the scandal broke in time for Jon Stewart to cover it last night ... and he's pretty ashamed of his home state, he admitted. "Political payback through traffic congestion? To see New Jersey sink to such a piss-poor, third-rate quality of corruption. This is New Jersey! A state renowned for its piss-rich, first-rate corruption."

Story: – A North Miami mayoral candidate has pretty much the endorsement to end all endorsements: Jesus Christ himself. Anna Pierre touts what she calls the "spiritual endorsement" on her campaign posters, and says she knows she's the one because the son of God sent her three signs that he endorsed her candidacy. Unfortunately, the former '90s Creole-language pop star wouldn't tell Local 10 what those signs were; she wants to keep them "private." That's just one of several quirky elements to the Florida race. Of the seven candidates, one got punched in the face at his campaign headquarters last week and another filed five police reports for stolen signs. Pierre, for her part, last month claimed she was being targeted by voodoo spells; NBC Miami reported that dolls stuck with pins were left outside her HQ on Easter Sunday.

Story: – The wall is moving forward: President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order authorizing work to begin on his long-promised border wall with Mexico, reports the Washington Post. "We've been talking about this right from the beginning," he said during a stop at the Homeland Security department, per AP. In a separate interview with ABC News, the president said he expected construction to begin in "months." He added that while the US would pay upfront, Mexico would eventually reimburse the nation. "I'm just telling you there will be a payment," he said. "It will be in a form, perhaps a complicated form." Trump said negotiations on the payment would begin soon. As for the wall itself, "as soon as we can, as soon as we can physically do it," he said of the timeline. "I would say in months." Trump actually signed two executive actions related to immigration while at DHS. He also will beef up border security by increasing the number of detention centers and field agents, and he'll penalize US cities—so-called "sanctuary cities"—that fail to comply with immigration laws by withholding federal grant money. Still to come is an order that is expected to curb the number of refugees coming from Muslim-majority nations such as Syria. The details on that one were reportedly still being worked out.

Story: – Should the GOP fail to choose a nominee on the first ballot at a convention in Cleveland in July, John Boehner has his pick ready—and it isn't any of the current contenders. "I'm for none of the above. I'm for Paul Ryan to be our nominee," Boehner told Politico on Wednesday, while referring to Ted Cruz as "Lucifer." A rep says Boehner's comments were "off-the-cuff" and about "a hypothetical scenario in which none of the current candidates are able to secure the nomination," per CNBC. But what does Ryan have to say? "I actually think you should run for president if you're going to be president, if you want to be president," Ryan told CNBC on Tuesday. "I'm not running for president. I made that decision, consciously, not to." While he said he is "happy where I am," he added, "I haven't given any thought" to a contested convention. "There are a lot of people running for president," he said. "We'll see. Who knows." A committee created to persuade Ryan to run has folded, which suggests he may be focused on his role as House speaker, reports the Washington Post.

Story: – Even with a major downturn in the oil business, the United Arab Emirates still has enough money to look at a few modest construction projects—including building a mountain in the desert. The Gulf nation, which is desperately short of rain, has paid $400,000 to the Colorado-based University Corporation for Atmospheric Research to study the possibility of boosting rainfall with an artificial mountain, Arabian Business reports. The UAE spent $558,000 on cloud-seeding, a process meant to increase the amount of rain produced by clouds, last year alone; lead researcher Roelof Bruintjes explains that a mountain would cause air to rise, creating more clouds to seed, though they're not entirely sure how tall the mountain should be. "Building a mountain is not a simple thing," he says. The next step will be to submit the team's plan to an engineering firm. Experts seem to think the idea is as outlandish as it sounds. "I really doubt that it would work," Oxford physics professor Raymond Pierrehumbert tells Vocativ. "You'd need to build a long ridge, not just a cone, otherwise the air would just go around," he explains, adding that even if that was possible, under local conditions, "it's really unlikely to work as there is very little evidence that cloud seeding produces much rainfall." He says no mountain will change the fact that the area is a desert, and the UAE would be far better off "putting the money into solar-powered desalination plants." Exactly how much money the project would cost isn't clear, though the Washington Post notes that a plan to give the Netherlands its first tall mountain had an estimated price tag of up to $230 billion—and was only found to be feasible if the mountain was hollow. (Norway has so many mountains it can give them to its friends.)

Story: – Weapons exports are big business, and with the end of a ban on them in place since the end of World War II, Japanese manufacturers are getting in the international war business. Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, Toshiba, and other brands better known for consumer electronics are poised to sell submarines, planes, and radar equipment to foreign powers, reports the Washington Post. Japan hosted its first defense trade show in May—just over a year after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe removed the ban. Restrictions remain on selling weapons to countries involved in conflict, however, in keeping with the country’s pacifist constitution. "We will more actively cooperate on defense equipment and technology with our ally the US and other countries to maintain regional peace and stability," Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera says in a statement, per Bloomberg. Despite the relative freedom the manufacturers now have, the military trade show was lacking in actual weaponry. There were no missiles, rifles, or grenade launchers on display, although Japanese companies do make and sell weapons within Japan. Most Japanese oppose Abe’s decision to lift the weapons export ban, the Post reports, and even military industry employees have trouble reconciling international gun sales with a staunchly pacifist image. "If we suddenly started exporting in-your-face weapons, personally, I would find that difficult," admits a helicopter sales rep for Kawasaki. Partially driving the change: The strength of neighboring China and the potential for sales in Southeast Asia.

Story: – Norway just became the world's biggest tree-hugger. The Independent reports the European country is the first in the world to ban deforestation, following a pledge by its parliament. That means the Norwegian government won't purchase anything that contributes to the destruction of the world's rainforests, especially beef, timber, soy, and palm oil that come from questionable sources, reports the Huffington Post. Instead, Norway will buy them via "deforestation-free supply chains." The production of those four items in seven heavily deforested countries accounts for 40% of global rainforest deforestation, according to Climate Action. (The countries are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Papau New Guinea.) The Rainforest Foundation Norway says the pledge is an "important victory" in the battle to preserve tropical forests and calls on other countries to follow suit. At the current rate of deforestation, the world's rainforests could be gone in a mere 100 years, CNN reports. Advocates say that clear-cutting rainforests not only destroys ecologically important trees, but releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when those trees are burned, contributing to climate change. (Eco-conscious Norway may also be banning the sale of gas-powered vehicles within the next decade.)

Story: – President Trump will have a talking point when he meets with Vladimir Putin in a few days: Twelve Russian intelligence officers were indicted on charges they hacked into Democratic email accounts during the 2016 US presidential election and released stolen information in the months before Americans headed to the polls, the Justice Department said Friday. The indictment is the clearest allegation yet of Russian efforts to meddle in American politics, per the AP. The indictment lays out a sweeping and coordinated effort to break into key Democratic email accounts, including those belonging to the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton campaign, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The hackers were members of an intelligence agency in the Russian military called the GRU, reports the Washington Post. The charges come as special counsel Robert Mueller investigates potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign to influence the presidential election. The indictment does not allege that Trump campaign associates were involved in the hacking or that any American was knowingly in contact with Russian intelligence officers.The indictment also does not allege that any vote tallies were altered by hacking. Still, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the internet "allows foreign adversaries to attack Americans in new and unexpected ways." He said the suspects worked to “hack into computers, steal documents, and release those documents with the intent to interfere with the election.” Rosenstein said Trump, who meets with Putin on Monday in Finland, had been briefed on the indictments.

Story: – The woman who played one of the best-known housekeepers in TV history has died after a fall in her bathroom over the weekend. Ann B. Davis, whose most famous role was witty and wise housekeeper Alice on the Brady Bunch, was discovered unconscious and died in the hospital the same day. She was 88 years old. "She was very sweet," her agent tells the Hollywood Reporter. "I represent a lot of well-known people, and few have been so content with their lot. She enjoyed what she did in life. She just had a birthday and was in fine health. It's sad she had to die this way." Davis, who won two Emmys for her role in the Bob Cummings Show in the '50s, also appeared on shows including Wagon Train and the John Forsyth Show. After the Brady Bunch ended, she had the occasional acting role, including appearances in Brady Bunch reunions, but devoted most of her time to prayer, Bible study, and volunteer work, the Los Angeles Times reports. "I never heard a large voice from above saying, 'Get out of show business, Ann,'" she said in 1995. "I just found that my priorities had changed and I knew that I needed some space."

Story: – The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee has asked its chair to recuse himself from the probe into the Trump administration's ties to Russia—but so far, Devin Nunes has said "nyet." Politico calls Nunes and the White House "defiant" after Rep. Adam Schiff's request Monday, which was spurred by the revelation that Nunes had met with an unnamed source somewhere on White House grounds the day before he said he had proof that members of Trump's transition team had been "incidentally" surveilled. When asked by reporters Tuesday if he'll keep leading the Russia investigation, Nunes replied, "Why would I not?" Democrats are pushing back on Nunes' actions, which remain shrouded in mystery: White House press secretary Sean Spicer remained cryptic Monday when reporters asked about Nunes' visit to the White House property on the night in question, per CBS News. "This is what a cover-up to a crime looks like," Rep. Eric Swalwell said on the Today show Tuesday, per NBC News. But Dems aren't the only ones scratching their heads. Also on the Today show, GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham questioned Nunes' "objectivity" and compared him to a rogue Inspector Clouseau from The Pink Panther. "He's gone off on a lark by himself," Graham noted, adding Nunes had "lost his ability to lead." And Sen. John McCain said Tuesday on CBS This Morning that Nunes has "a lot of explaining to do." The intel chair has further plunged the committee into what Rep. Jim Himes described on MSNBC's Morning Joe as a state of "suspended animation" by whiting out the committee's meetings for the rest of the week. Originally set for Tuesday: a public hearing with testimony from ex-AG Sally Yates, former National Intelligence head James Clapper, and ex-CIA chief John Brennan that Nunes has since canceled.

Story: – Japan is bound by its post-war constitution to put little emphasis on the military, but a major upgrade is now in the works. The nation will get its first aircraft carriers since World War II, reports the Guardian. The plan is to retrofit two existing helicopter carriers so they can be used by fighter jets, too. It dovetails with Tokyo's recent decision to buy more than 100 F-35 jets from the US, on top of 42 previously purchased. The move is likely to draw criticism that Japan is moving even further away from the pacifist aims of its constitution. As Reuters notes, the constitution technically bans the maintenance of armed forces, though it has been interpreted more liberally to allow for a military on self-defense grounds. Japan's move is largely seen as a response to China's efforts to step up its own navy. Beijing acquired its first aircraft carrier in 2012, and it is currently building its third, reports the South China Morning Post. The Tokyo development is indeed "a major departure from Japanese postwar military policy," writes Kyle Mizokami at Popular Mechanics. But don't expect to see the carriers anytime soon. Mizokami runs down the logistics involved with the retrofitting—including the possible addition of ramps—and figures the ships won't be operational for at least five years. (Japan also is dealing with an ever-growing surplus of plutonium.)
Summary: 1. What is the significance of Japan's decision to upgrade its military capabilities, particularly the acquisition of aircraft carriers, and how does it align with the country's post-war constitution?2. How does Japan's move to acquire aircraft carriers compare to China's military expansion in the region, particularly with regards to China's own aircraft carrier development and capabilities?3. What are the potential implications of Japan's decision on the balance of power in the region, and how might it impact the United States' strategic interests in the area?4. How does Japan's decision to acquire more F-35 jets from the US fit into its broader military modernization efforts, and what are the potential benefits and drawbacks of relying on foreign military equipment?5. What are the logistical challenges involved in retrofitting existing helicopter carriers to accommodate fighter jets, and how long might the retrofitting process take?6. How might Japan's decision to upgrade its military capabilities impact its relationships with neighboring countries, particularly those with whom it has historical disputes or tensions?7. What role might Japan's military modernization play in the broader geopolitical dynamics of the region, particularly in light of the ongoing competition between the US and China?8. How might Japan's decision to acquire more nuclear energy, as mentioned in the article, impact its military capabilities and strategic goals in the region?9. What are the potential risks and unintended consequences of Japan's military modernization efforts, both for the country itself and for the broader regional security landscape?10. How might Japan's decision to upgrade its military capabilities be seen as a signal to other countries in the region, particularly those with whom it has historical or territorial disputes?
Story: – A woman trying to fend off a rabid fox that was biting her in the leg reached down with one hand to hold shut its mouth and with the other strangled it, the AP reports. "I couldn't do anything else to get it away from me," Tammy DuBois, 52, of Pittsgrove, told NJ.com. "I don't like to kill anything." The attack occurred July 18 shortly after DuBois heard rustling in some bushes while she was walking out to her backyard garden. DuBois says the fox ran out and bit her leg multiple times, puncturing her skin. She tried to escape into her house but couldn't while the animal gnawed on her leg, she says. "It was biting at my leg, I had to do something." And so she grabbed the animal's snout with one hand and the fox's neck with her other hand, she said. The fox struggled to get free but soon went limp from being choked. DuBois cleaned and bandaged her badly bleeding leg and called her husband, who took her to a hospital, where she began a two-week series of rabies treatments. Animal control officers retrieved the dead fox and sent it to the state for tests, confirming Monday it had rabies.

Story: – Covering his face, South African runner Oscar Pistorius arrived at a Pretoria court today via police car, the BBC reports. After being charged with one count of murder, he was in tears; prosecutors are making a case that the crime was premeditated, the AP notes. The court pushed Pistorius' bail hearing to next week in the case that found his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, dead in his home. In the meantime, Pistorius will stay in the police station. Pistorius is doing "very well, obviously emotional, but fine," his lawyer says. Meanwhile, a forensic team is set to continue an investigation of his house as more details emerge in the case. After reports yesterday suggested Pistorious mistook Steenkamp for an intruder, local media is now suggesting he shot her four times through the bathroom door, Sky News reports. Time cites local reports suggesting that police were first called to the Pistorius home shortly after midnight by neighbors who heard a loud argument.

Story: – Maybe his momentum isn't slowing after all. A new poll by ABC and the Washington Post puts Mitt Romney up 50-47 on President Obama, which is within the margin of error but marks the first time Romney has hit the 50% mark. Among the reasons for his stronger showing: Race: Obama continues to do well among non-white voters with about 80% of support. But among whites, he trails Romney by a sizable 59-38. That 21-point deficit is nearly three times worse than his deficit with John McCain at this point four years ago, and it sets the stage for this election "to be more polarized along racial lines" than any since 1988, notes the Washington Post. Economy: Romney made big gains here, and now leads 52-43 on which candidate should be trusted to fix things. It's the first "clear lead" for either, notes ABC. Also, Obama lost his empathy advantage. Asked which candidate better understands ordinary Americans' struggles, the president barely edged Romney 48-46.

Story: – There's a kind of pasta in the world that is so hard to find and so difficult to make that you're going to have to travel to the tiny hamlet of Nuoro on the Italian island of Sardinia to get a taste. That's because su filindeu, which translates to "the threads of God" or "God's yarns," is only made by three living women, descendants of a long line of women who for 300 years have passed down the family recipe, reports the BBC. One of them, Paola Abraini, is 62 and wakes at 7am every day to make the pasta. The recipe isn't secret, it's hard—so hard that no one else seems able to make it: Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver gave up after trying for two hours this summer; engineers from pasta giant Barilla couldn't get a machine to replicate it. Su filindeu consists of only three ingredients: durum wheat semolina, water, and salt. "Elasticity is fundamental," explains the Slow Food Foundation, and this is achieved by patting the dough with salted or plain water. "The exact moment when this should be done cannot be exactly defined, it is a sensation that only who is kneading can recognize," it explains. Sections of the dough are then stretched, using the fingers, eight times into angel-hair-like strands and layered on a flat basket called a fundu. The pasta is then sun-dried, and ultimately looks like "tree bark," explain the Pasta Grannies in a video. It's prepared only one way: cooked in mutton stock with pecorino cheese added. "I love it more each day," Abraini says of the pasta. (Read another feel-good story involving pasta.)

Story: – A meat cleaver, a stun gun, a katana, and a crossbow. Those are just a few pieces of the impressive arsenal found inside the car of a man in an employee parking lot at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, CBS Boston reports. Police say 48-year-old Matthew Bromson was acting suspicious outside the stadium hours before the Winter Classic—an annual outdoor NHL game—on New Year's Day, according to WCVB. CBS reports he was believed to be drunk. A photo taken by police following Bromson's arrest shows at least eight weapons pulled from his car. Bromson is facing a litany of charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon after allegedly making witnesses "fear for their safety" through his "actions and words," CBS reports. A spokesperson says Bromson isn't an employee of either Gillette Stadium or the New England Patriots, who play there. It also doesn't appear he was there to attend the Winter Classic. Police say he was never a threat to anyone inside the stadium. According to WCVB, Bromson was involved in an hours-long standoff with Connecticut police back in 2014.

Story: – A young woman is in trouble with police after allegedly letting a group of men treat her like a hot dog—a naked, riot-inciting hot dog—at a Miami Beach Johnny Rockets earlier this month, the New York Daily News reports. According to the Miami New Times, things got off to a quick start when Angelic Valle reportedly walked into the restaurant already topless Oct. 9 and started removing her bikini bottoms. The Daily News reports she then allegedly performed multiple lewd acts against the Johnny Rockets furniture culminating in her coup de grâce, lying on a table while a bunch of men dumped ketchup and water on her. Police identified Valle as the suspect and arrested her this week after video of the incident went viral online, the Daily News reports. She was booked on suspicion of incite to riot, indecent exposure, lewd and lascivious behavior, disorderly conduct, and breach of the peace. According to the New Times, Valle may be less than contrite for her alleged fast-food strip routine. “That [expletive] was fun now that I remember it,” she states in a video posted to her Instagram. “Take me to jail but it was fun, and everybody looked like they were having fun.” Police are also looking for one of the men seen in the video for allegedly touching Valle during the incident.

Story: – Fingerprinting is an "old-fashioned technique," says Dave Thomas of the South Wales police. Convicting a drug dealer on the basis of a partial fingerprint from a photo in a WhatsApp message, however, is groundbreaking stuff. The image of a hand holding ecstasy pills was the key evidence in a case that sent 11 members of a drug gang to prison. Thomas says that amid a stream of messages on the phone of a suspect, there was a "photograph of the hand holding pills that seemed like it was sent to potential customers saying 'these are my wares, I'm selling these,'" the BBC reports. The photo was sent to the force's scientific unit and while there was no match on Britain's national fingerprint database, it was enough to link 28-year-old Elliott Morris to the supply chain. He was sentenced to 8.5 years in prison after a raid that seized large quantities of ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana, the Birmingham Mail reports. Thomas says it was the first conviction in Wales based on a fingerprint taken from a photo—and there are likely to be plenty more. "While the scale and quality of the photograph proved a challenge, the small bits were enough to prove he was the dealer," Thomas says. "It has now opened the floodgates and when there is part of a hand on a photograph, officers are sending them in." (Researchers say even people who don't use drugs might have cocaine in their fingerprints.)

Story: – Cheryl Rios is the CEO of Dallas-based Go Ape Marketing, but some are saying her views on leadership are as primitive as her company's moniker. Rios recently made it clear on Facebook that she doesn't support Hillary Clinton as president—but it's not just Clinton herself that bothers Rios. After the CEO noted Clinton isn't the "right person" for the job, she continued, "more importantly a female shouldn't be president," per CBS 11. "Let the haters begin." Rios—whose Twitter bio describes herself as a "Mom who still thinks Old Fashioned is cool"—further elaborated: "With the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war. Yes I run my own business and I love it and I am great at it BUT that is not the same as being the President, that should be left to a man, a good, strong, honorable man." Rios doubled down to a CBS 11 reporter: "I believe in what I said. There's an old biblical sound reasoning why a woman shouldn't be president," though the station's report doesn't mention what that theological reasoning might be. Rios continued her take on Twitter today, posting, "I am old fashioned, I am Christian and believe what I have said. I didn't say that women should be abused, or that they are stupid or can't be lawyers, doctors or run successful businesses, I fully know and support that they can as I have done that. I mentioned one position only the Head of our government." She then implores people to "please stop the nastiness." One of Rios' own clients, a male motorcycle store owner, is baffled by her take, telling CBS 11, "I can't comprehend someone who thinks a woman can't do anything a man can do. They can. I promise you they can." (Croatia just elected its first female president.)

Story: – Greece says it's about time Germany opens its checkbook and pays $303 billion in reparation money stemming from the Nazi occupation of Greece in World War II. Greece's deputy finance minister says the sum, put forth by the General Accounting Office, accounts for war reparations, the repayment of an "occupation loan" paid by the Bank of Greece, and the return of stolen artifacts, Reuters reports. Such a sum would surely help out Greece as it struggles with its own debts; Greece must pay the International Monetary Fund $487 million by Thursday, the BBC notes. Germany, however, has denied all previous claims that it owes Greece anything following a 115 million deutschmark payment in 1960.

Story: – Scientists now know that Gulf War Syndrome is more than just a psychological condition—it's actually tied to brain damage. But for the first time, they have zeroed in on physical proof that this is the case. The Georgetown researchers used fMRI machines on 31 Gulf War vets and were able to spot abnormalities in the bundles of nerve fibers that process pain. They "have deteriorated compared to the control," says a researcher, and USA Today explains the impact thusly: "a tiny pulse of pressure is interpreted as a painful pinch, or normal muscle fatigue from walking a flight of stairs could be interpreted as climbing to the fourteenth floor." The discovery is "huge," says another researcher, because it will allow veterans to be quickly diagnosed via the fMRI scan. Most hospitals are equipped with the necessary MRI machines, and would just need to install the proper software and train their technicians on its use. "We're able to say, 'There is something here,'" says the study's lead author. "'Take these veterans seriously when they come in.'" You can check out PLoS ONE to see the original paper.
Summary: 1. Can you provide more information on the sample size of the study? How many Gulf War vets were included in the study?2. What specific abnormalities were found in the bundles of nerve fibers that process pain? Were there any differences in the abnormalities between the Gulf War vets and the control group?3. How did the researchers determine that the abnormalities in the nerve fibers were caused by brain damage? What methods did they use to rule out other potential causes?4. How does the discovery of these abnormalities in the nerve fibers impact the diagnosis and treatment of Gulf War Syndrome? Will this new information lead to changes in the way veterans are evaluated and treated?5. What are the implications of this research for other populations that may be experiencing similar brain damage? Could this discovery lead to new treatments or therapies for other conditions?6. How does the fact that most hospitals are equipped with MRI machines impact the diagnosis and treatment of Gulf War Syndrome? Will this make it easier for veterans to receive a proper diagnosis and treatment?7. Can you provide more information on the software and training that will be needed for technicians to use the MRI machines to diagnose Gulf War Syndrome? How will this training be provided?8. How will this discovery change the way we understand the long-term effects of military service on the brain? Will this lead to new policies or recommendations for military personnel?9. What are the next steps in this research? Are there plans to conduct further studies to confirm these findings or to explore other aspects of Gulf War Syndrome?10. How can the public support this research and help ensure that veterans receive the care and support they deserve?
Story: – The Clinton WikiLeaks keep on coming: In the latest release of emails from hacked campaign chief John Podesta, Podesta and other Clinton aides complain about her reaction to the emerging furor over her private email server. In one message from April last year, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden complains about how Clinton lawyer Cheryl Mills' fondness for secrecy led to the email mess, reports Politico. "This is a cheryl special," she writes. "This stuff is like her Achilles heal. [sic] Or kryptonite. she just can't say no to this s--t. Why didn't they get this stuff out like 18 months ago?" She goes on to say: "I guess I know the answer. They wanted to get away with it." "We've taken on a lot of water that won't be easy to pump out of the boat," Podesta writes to Tanden in a September 2015 exchange, per the Washington Post. "Most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre-campaign, but a lot has to do with her instincts." Tanden, who now runs Clinton's transition team, replies: "Almost no one knows better [than] me that her instincts can be terrible." In other emails, aides complained about her reluctance to apologize even after the FBI opened its investigation, though they also praised her strengths and hailed her successes, reports the Post, which notes that the leaked emails offer "an almost unprecedented historical archive" of a campaign's inner workings.

Story: – With the survival of the eurozone at stake, European leaders are aiming to complete a plan this week that will transform the region and save the euro, reports the New York Times. Despite major differences that remain between Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, a four-point deal is taking shape, including increased fiscal discipline for eurozone countries to be added to European treaties; an increase of the European Financial Stability Facility to two or three times its current size; more money to the IMF to increase the bailout fund; and relaxing regulations to enable the European Central Bank in the short run to continue aggressively supporting Italian and Spanish bonds. It's a huge and ambitious plan—and completely irrelevant to the eurozone's problems, says Alex Harrowell at A Fistful of Euros, noting that two of the biggest violators of the eurozone's fiscal rules for the past decade were Germany and France. With Germany obsessing about austerity and French concerned with sovereignty, "I doubt they have ever understood the economic and financial dynamics behind the crisis," writes Wolfgang Munchau in the Financial Times. Propping up the ECB in the short run and moving toward eurobonds in the long run—along with a true fiscal union—is the only hope of saving the euro. "What I fear is a fudge," says Munchau, calling temporary liquidity without bigger changes "a compromise, but no solution."

What is the significance of the fact that two of the biggest violators of the eurozone's fiscal rules were Germany and France? How does this impact the effectiveness of the proposed plan?8. How does the idea of proping up the ECB in the short run and moving towards eurobonds in the long run factor into the proposed plan? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach?9. What is the significance of the term "true fiscal union"? How does it relate to the proposed plan, and what are the potential implications of establishing such a union?10. What is Munchau's overall assessment of the proposed plan, and what does he believe is the key to saving the euro?
Story: – We've all seen squirrels water ski, but have you ever seen a squirrel surf? ABC News reports Australia's Quincy "The Flying Squirrel" Symonds is already carving waves like a pro despite being only 7 years old. "She is definitely special," the World Surf League women's commissioner says. "She has a strong connection to the ocean." And her surf coach tells Today he's never seen anyone so good so young. Quincy's parents say they couldn't get her out of the water when she was little. She started surfing at 4 years old and was already entering competitions by 5. “She just kept smiling and laughing no matter how many times she fell off," her mother Kim Symonds tells ABC. Quincy's success is even more impressive given she was born with a genetic condition that kept her in and out of intensive care. Quincy has congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which limits her body's ability to manufacture some hormones. She requires daily doses of steroids to make up for her body's lack of cortisone. But her condition isn't slowing her down. Quincy surfs about eight hours per day and hopes to go pro. Her parents say they just want it to stay fun. "It’s not my goal for her to achieve anything in particular," her father Jake Symonds tells ABC. “I’m just excited to see what she’ll do with it."

Story: – A recent study found handing your toddler an iPad is a bad idea; a new study shows 97% of kids under age 4 have used a mobile device anyway and 75% have a tablet, smartphone, or iPod of their own. The small-scale study—based on the responses of 350 low-income parents in Philadelphia—identified "almost universal exposure, early adoption, and use of mobile media devices among young children," the lead author tells the CBC. About 70% of parents said their children used devices unsupervised, including while parents did chores. About 65% said a device was used to appease a child in public, while 25% of parents said they'd left a child with a device at bedtime, though screens generally keep sleep at bay, per the New York Times. Some 44% of kids under 1 and 77% of 2-year-olds used a mobile device daily; a third of 3- and 4-year-olds used more than one device at a time. A researcher at Philadelphia's Einstein Medical Center says, "We see every parent pulling out the iPhone and giving it to their baby," so the study "was sort of validation (in) real life," per USA Today. A psychology professor says the results are "huge," but "we simply don't know what the consequences are for (kids') early social development." An expert on media and children's health adds he "would not be surprised if these levels of device ownership and use were similar in many families" outside of Philadelphia, but he questions whether parents should actually be worried. Scientists "ring the alarm bell without any content on why we should be alarmed," he says. They should conduct "research to understand how we are changed by the media we use." The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using a device with your child, setting time limits, and establishing tech-free zones.
Summary: 1. What was the purpose of the small-scale study conducted by the lead author, and what were the findings of the study?2. How did the study define "mobile media devices," and what types of devices were included in the study?3. What were the age ranges of the children included in the study, and how did their device use vary across different age groups?4. How did parents report using devices to appease their children in public, and what are the potential implications of this behavior?5. What were the findings regarding the use of devices at bedtime, and how do these results align with previous research on screen time and sleep?6. How did the study's findings compare to previous research on device use among young children, and what are the broader implications of these findings?7. What are the potential consequences of early and extensive device use on children's social development, according to the psychology professor quoted in the article?8. How does the expert on media and children's health interpret the study's findings, and what are their recommendations for parents?9.

Story: – "Her face was completely covered with bees." So said a captain with the Orange County Fire Authority of a woman who was stung more than 200 times on Monday. Cpt. Tony Bommarito tells NBC Southern California she was essentially covered head to toe. The scene in Lake Forest was so bad that responders opted against protocol and didn't suit up in protective gear before coming to the aid of the woman, identified by KTLA as a 48-year-old named Maria. They used carbon dioxide spray in an attempt to get the bees to release and carried her, "barely conscious," from the scene. A paramedic and three firefighters suffered stings themselves, two badly enough to be briefly hospitalized themselves. As for the primary victim, the Orange County Register reports she's a housekeeper who had gone to get cleaning supplies from her car, which was parked near the hive. She is expected to survive. NBC Southern California describes a bee company as later "removing buckets full of bees and beehives from the area." KTLA reports the removal company estimated the hive held as many as 80,000 bees. (This hiker died after being smothered by bees.)

Story: – The face of America changed drastically in the last 50 years, and will look quite different in another half-century. Before the Immigration and Nationality Act passed in 1965, white Americans made up 84% of the population, followed by African Americans at 11%, Hispanics at 4%, and Asians at less than 1%, per a Pew Research Center report. Today, with immigration policies no longer favoring Europeans, those figures are 62%, 12%, 18%, and 6%, respectively. How will they change in another 50 years? The US population will probably include 46% whites, 24% Hispanics, 14% Asians, and 13% African Americans, Pew reports. The biggest change comes with a new largest immigrant group: Hispanics now make up 47% of immigrants, but Pew expects they'll total 31% by 2065, while Asians—including from China, Pakistan, and India—will total 38%, reports CNN. That might seem surprising since half of all immigrants since 1965 have come from Latin America—28% from Mexico—but an "abrupt slowdown" of illegal immigration from Mexico has cut into that, the report notes, per the New York Times. Just 1.7 million immigrants from Central and South America arrived in the last five years, compared to 2.5 million from Asia, reports CNN, which notes 11.3 million immigrants are considered unauthorized. By 2065, the US population is expected to rise to 441 million, with new immigrants and their children responsible for 88% of growth, reports the Los Angeles Times. How do Americans feel? About 45% say immigrants are making the country a better place, while 37% say they're making it worse. Almost half say Asian immigrants have a positive effect on the country, while just 26% say the same of immigrants from Latin America.
Summary: 1. What are the current demographic changes in the US population due to immigration, according to the Pew Research Center report?2. What is the expected change in the US population by 2065, according to the Pew report, and how will the largest immigrant groups change?3.

Story: – Police haven't named the 58-year-old shooter who killed two people and himself in a Lafayette, La., movie theater last night, but they say he's a "lone white male" with a criminal history, the AP reports. A police spokesman told reporters that the bomb squad was called in after suspicious items were found in the man's car, and officers are investigating "items of interest" inside the theater, where there are still bodies, including that of the shooter, the Daily Advertiser reports. Five things to know: Police say at least seven people were injured, some critically, ranging in age from their teens to their 60s, reports the New York Times. One victim who underwent surgery is "not doing well," a police spokesman says. The shooting occurred at a 7:10pm showing of the romantic comedy Trainwreck. Star Amy Schumer tweeted: "My heart is broken and all my thoughts and prayers are with everyone in Louisiana." Gov. Bobby Jindal, who traveled to the scene, said he had spoken to two teachers who acted heroically after the man began shooting, apparently at random, 20 minutes into the movie, the AP reports. One teacher jumped in front of another, probably saving her life, Jindal says, and the second teacher was able to ring the fire alarm to alert moviegoers despite having been shot in the leg. Police say there were around 100 people in the theater when the man opened fire, and he was dead by the time they got there, CNN reports. A witness in a neighboring theater says he heard "gunshots after gunshots," which he thought was part of a movie until alarms started going off. The shooting comes three years to the week after James Holmes killed 12 people in a Colorado movie theater, the AP notes. Yesterday, jurors decided that the attack justifies the death penalty, though he has not yet been sentenced.

Story: – Jen Gann was talking with someone earlier this year about her toddler Dudley's cystic fibrosis, a noncurable genetic disorder that afflicts sufferers with thick mucus in the lungs, causing lung infections and, for many, early death. In her piece for the Cut, Gann says that when the woman she was conversing with asked her what she would have done had prenatal tests revealed Dudley had CF, she thought: "I do know exactly what it is I would have done." She says she and her husband, Tag, had discussed their options even before she became pregnant, and they'd jointly agreed they would have an abortion if something was wrong with the fetus. Which leads to the unique situation Gann now finds herself in: trying to save her son's life by showing she would've ended it before it started. That's because she and Tag have filed a wrongful-birth lawsuit, a complaint against a practitioner for failing to diagnose or inform parents-to-be about the possibility of a severe condition. When plaintiffs win these cases, the awarded funds go toward the often "astronomically high" costs of the child's medical care. "In other words, a mother desperate to help her child declares that she would not have had that child," Gann writes. She documents the pushback from anti-abortion activists for this type of suit, her "biological remorse," and the hatred she sometimes feels for mothers who choose to not even get tested. This, despite her concession that advances in CF have extended life spans and furthered patients' hope: "It's something almost beyond me to imagine, looking into Dudley's eyes and saying, 'I'm sorry I didn't save you, from your own life.'" Gann's story here, including her chat with the woman who set the stage for wrongful-birth suits.

Story: – Michael Cox and Taylor Anderton just want to tie the knot, have four kids, and enjoy the rest of their lives together, but their families are balking at the second part of the young Australian couple's plan. Not because they're in a Montague-and-Capulet-style feud, but because they worry Cox and Anderton—dating for nearly two years, engaged for almost one—won't be able to handle parental responsibilities, since they both have Down syndrome, Australia Story reports. "That makes me feel very worried, apprehensive, and concerned," Anderton's mom says, and Cox's dad agrees: "I don't see parenthood being something that they're going to achieve, or really they probably should achieve." He notes it would be "very difficult" for the couple to handle not only day-to-day activities such as having jobs and driving, but also parenting skills such as helping out with homework and dealing with adolescent issues. The couple gained recognition in May when a clip about them aired on ABC Australia. A geneticist tells Australia Story a couple with Down syndrome becoming pregnant is a rarity, and that if they did conceive, chances would be about 50-50 they'd have a child with Down syndrome. Michelle O'Flynn, director of Queensland Advocacy Inc., notes the couple's parents could try to block a pregnancy by getting a sterilization order, though she says they'd probably fail and that that option is "abhorrent." Disability advocates like O'Flynn say it's Cox and Anderton's right to retain "bodily integrity" and reproduce if they want. But Cox's dad dismisses that, noting, "[The advocates are] not the ones picking up the pieces." Michael Cox understands their parents' concern, noting, "Their heart is in the right place," but he says they're "overprotective." (A Nova Scotia dad calls his son's Down syndrome "beautiful.")

Story: – So the United Kingdom voted for Brexit, PM David Cameron announced his resignation, and scores of people starting frenetically Googling "What happens if we leave the EU?"—just a few hours after they already voted en masse to do so, the Verge reports. Google Trends tweeted there was a 250% spike in just one hour for that search term after the polls had closed. And Friday morning, even more confused people didn't seem to understand what had gone down the day before, with Google Trends reporting a 2,450% spike in the somewhat panicked "Are we in or out of the EU?" Other after-the-fact queries that saw a boost included: "What happens to foreigners if we leave the EU?," "What happens if we stay in the EU?," and the search term that Ars Technica dubs to be perhaps the most worrisome: "What is Brexit?" All of this leads the Verge to ponder why such a "wildly complex" issue of the UK defecting from the EU was left to a people's referendum instead of in the hands of "independent experts" who may have had a better grasp on the issues. "Referendums are a brute-force political engine, a numbers game designed to spit out a yes or no answer on a simple question," the site notes. But UK residents had apparently "had enough of experts"—at least according to the country's justice minister, Michael Gove, who had recently made controversial comments comparing pro-EU economists to Nazi sympathizers, per the Guardian. At least some UK citizens seem to have wrapped their head around what the Brexit vote could mean for them: The search term "getting an Irish passport" jumped 100% Friday morning—although Northern Ireland is part of the UK, Ireland proper is independent of it. (What's next after the Brexit vote.)

Story: – Anyone in need of a lifetime supply of toilet paper should get in touch with the State Department. The US Embassy in London, which recently moved to a new building from the one it kept for more than 200 years, is cleaning house of the usual office gear: tables, chairs, desks, bookcases, lamps, a filing cabinet, and a photocopier, per the BBC. Also up for grabs in a 41-lot online State Department auction are 1,200 rolls of "mini jumbos" toilet paper (current price $335), described by an embassy rep as "probably a bit above bog standard," per the Independent. The outlet notes the rolls from the embassy's former Grosvenor Square location, which a Qatari real estate group plans to turn into a hotel, don't fit in the dispensers at the new $1 billion location in Battersea. Some 756 rolls of paper towels ($291), a ceramic lamp without a shade ($157), a circular saw ($85), barcode scanners ($138), a camera with no charger ($34), a laptop without a power cord ($237), five broken vacuums ($45 to $66), and a 2007 Volvo S80 with 21,300 miles (about $8,500) apparently aren't needed, either. Several other items have already been disposed of in earlier auctions—you missed out on an electric oven, numerous laptops, and a Volvo S60 with a badly dented front end—but the BBC notes none "have any official US insignias or historical value." The latest auction ends Aug. 8. Per ABC News, items from US embassies in Ankara, Kyiv, Belgrade, Stockholm, and Lisbon are also up for grabs in current or upcoming auctions, which you can scan here.

Story: – Sanford refused to accept its police chief's resignation today despite his handling of the George Zimmerman case, CBS News reports. The Florida city's commissioners voted 3-2 to reject Bll Lee's resignation, and most of them blamed tumult surrounding the Trayvon Martin shooting on outsiders. "The city has experienced great turmoil in the past two months and we are hoping to stabilize the department and continue with this time of healing," said City Manager Norton Bonaparte. Lee had temporarily stepped aside last month, and already received a no-confidence vote from Sanford commissioners, notes the AP. Lee will remain on administrative leave pending the outcome of an outside investigation.

Story: – An Italian war reporter held hostage for five months by rebel forces in Syria has written a damning denunciation of the anti-Assad movement. "It is not the revolution that I encountered two years ago in Aleppo—secular, tolerant. It has become something else," Domenico Quirico wrote in his newspaper La Stampa, per the New York Times. "Our captors were from a group that professed itself to be Islamist but that in reality is made up of mixed-up young men who have joined the revolution because the revolution now belongs to these groups that are midway between banditry and fanaticism," he wrote, per the BBC. "They follow whoever promises them a future, gives them weapons, gives them money to buy cell phones, computers, clothes." More controversially, Quirico's fellow captive, Belgian academic Pierre Piccinin, has accused the rebels—of whom he says he was previously a "fierce supporter"—of framing Bashar al-Assad with last month's chemical weapons attacks, after overhearing their captors say as much on a Skype conversation with other rebels. But Quirico is less certain. "We heard some people we didn’t know talking through a half-closed door," he says, per the Times. "It’s impossible to know whether what was said was based on real fact or just hearsay." Nevertheless, he says, he does not support a US military strike against Syria, which he says would only strengthen extremist forces, reports ANSA. "Our captors were happy at the idea of an American bombardment," he says.

Story: – Should conscription ever again be necessary in the United States, it'll still be men called first. Though now eligible to fill combat posts, women will not be forced to register for involuntary military service beginning in January 2018. The provision mandating that women sign up—backed by women's rights advocates, some military leaders, and Sen. John McCain, per the Hill—had been included in drafts of the annual defense bill that passed House and Senate panels, but it was left out of a final draft revealed Tuesday, reports Military Times. The National Defense Authorization Act instead asks for a fresh look at the Selective Service System, which requires men 18 to 26 to register for the draft, to see if it's still warranted. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse calls the $618.7 billion bill "a victory for common sense" that shows "both sides will put national security ahead of unnecessary culture-warring." Some $59.5 billion is dedicated to the Overseas Contingency Operations war fund, including $383 million for airstrikes against the Islamic State. Another $8.3 billion will cover the hiring of more troops, plus 2% pay raises; President Obama had initially asked for $5.1 billion to cover those costs, reports the Hill. He's not likely to be pleased by much else in the bill, though. The AP reports a presidential veto is possible as the bill also forbids closing Guantanamo Bay and military bases, or reducing the number of active-duty troops. The House is expected to vote on the bill by Friday.
Summary: 1. What is the current state of conscription in the United States, and how has it evolved over time?2.

Story: – Two US service members were killed Thursday battling Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan alongside local troops, reports the AP, rare combat deaths for American forces who largely handed over securing the nation to Afghan troops some two years ago. NATO described the Americans killed and two other Americans wounded in the assault as being part of "a train, advise, and assist mission" in Afghanistan's Kunduz province. They have not been identified. Kunduz officials later said they were investigating claims that local civilians also were killed in the fighting, possibly in a retaliatory airstrike. Taliban fighters briefly overran the city of Kunduz in early October, a show of strength by the insurgents that also highlighted the troubles facing local Afghan forces 15 years after the US-led invasion of the country. The Taliban captured and held parts of Kunduz a year earlier as well before the city was fully liberated weeks later with the help of US airstrikes. Though US combat operations are officially over, thousands of US troops remain in Afghanistan, and special forces routinely accompany Afghan forces on missions, notes Reuters. (Afghanistan's own refugee crisis is beyond grim.)

Story: – Celaida Lissabet, 15, was participating in what was supposed to be a fun event at her Miami-area charter school last October, wrestling with a classmate while wearing an inflatable sumo suit during "Spirit Day"—but things went terribly awry, leaving the girl with severe brain damage, according to a new lawsuit. The 9th-grader fell off the protective mat and hit her head on the ground three times; after being sent back to class, she complained of blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, and headaches, and was taken to the hospital. Her mom says the teen now acts like a child, has trouble communicating, and is plagued by anxiety, the Miami Herald reports. "The second time [she fell] she told the gentleman that her head was hurting and she was seeing blurry and she didn’t want to do it anymore and he told her that she had to do it three times," says Celaida’s mom, Raquel Lissabet, according to CBS Miami. "The third time she was finally knocked down and they stood her up and sent her to class." Now Raquel Lissabet is suing the school, Mater Academy, and Mega Party Events, the company that provided the suits. The lawsuit claims that both failed to provide adequately trained personnel and adequately fitting helmets, reports NBC 6 South Florida. "It’s not my daughter," Raquel Lissabet says. "It’s a completely different person." In 2007, a woman in Colorado won $2 million in damages after falling in an inflatable sumo wrestling suit at a company retreat and suffering severe brain damage. (In another freak accident last month, a 2-year-old was killed by a statue.)

Story: – The Guardian highlights WikiLeaks cables surrounding the release of Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi, freed by Scotland last year because he supposedly had only a few months to live. The cables show that Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's government put "thuggish" pressure on Britain to make sure Megrahi went free. "Specific threats have included the immediate cessation of all UK commercial activity in Libya, a diminishment or severing of political ties, and demonstrations against official UK facilities," wrote the US ambassador. That info was followed by this doozy: "[Libyan] officials also implied, but did not directly state, that the welfare of UK diplomats and citizens in Libya would be at risk." Megrahi is still alive today, and a British cable sent to the US prior to his release suggests his cancer diagnosis was far from certain. "Megrahi could have as long as 5 years to live," said the memo. "Doctors are not sure where he is on the time scale." Read more at the Scotsman.

Story: – Some early reaction to today's ruling that blocks the main elements of Arizona's immigration law: Jeffrey Toobin, CNN: "I think this is a case very much destined for United States Supreme Court. It is the kind of big issue relating to the responsibilities of state versus federal government on a very important matter, so it's likely, given how much attention this law received that other states will be passing similar laws. I think the Supreme Court will get involved probably next year." Elie Mystal, Above the Law: "From Citizens United to the deep-water drilling moratorium, Obama has been smacked around by the courts recently. This victory should make the White House pretty happy… to say nothing of legal US citizens who at least for a time will be allowed to go about their lives." Ed Morrissey, Hot Air: "What will be interesting will be to see whether this impacts public opinion. The Obama administration has taken a beating in the polls on this issue, with poll after poll showing majorities of Americans supporting the Arizona law. A temporary injunction on portions of the bill may get some people rethinking the issue, but I’d be surprised if there was any substantial movement." William Jacobson, Legal Insurrection: "The decision has to be viewed as a near complete victory for opponents of the law, as it restricts the state from routine and compulsory checks of immigration status as a matter of legislative mandate."

Story: – Melissa Benoit "thought it was a piece of science fiction" when she learned what doctors had done to her, CBC reports. The Canadian mom just couldn't believe it when she learned she had survived for six days without lungs—an impressive feat detailed in a study published Wednesday. According to the Guardian, Benoit, 32, was born with cystic fibrosis. After she came down with a flu that left her coughing so hard she fractured ribs, she was admitted to the hospital in April, the Canadian Press reports. There, doctors realized she had only hours to live. Benoit's lungs were failing, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria was sending her into septic shock, dropping her blood pressure, and knocking her organs out of commission. Life support wasn't working. Desperate, surgeons decided to remove Benoit's lungs—the source of the bacteria—and go from there. Doctors say "there were a lot of unknowns"—as far as they know, nothing like this had ever been done before—but got "courage" knowing that Benoit would "for sure" die that day if they did nothing. It took 13 people nine hours to remove Benoit's lungs, which were swollen and hard with mucus. They had no idea how long they'd have to wait until a new set of lungs would be available for transplant. In the meantime, they hooked Benoit's heart to an artificial lung. Within minutes, her blood pressure returned to normal. Six days later, she received a successful lung transplant. Benoit says doctors "pulled me back from the dead." (A baby went on the transplant list, and a match turned up in 40 minutes.)

Story: – Two pregnant American women infected with the Zika virus have miscarried, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Thursday. It's the first potentially Zika-related miscarriages in the US, the Washington Post reports. According to ABC News, officials have been concerned the virus could cross through the placenta and cause miscarriages. These miscarriages would appear to confirm that theory. "It's absolutely possible for an infection, whether it be viral or bacterial, to result in a miscarriage," one obstetrician-gynecologist tells the Post. The Zika virus was found in the placentas of both women. But it has not been confirmed the miscarriages were actually caused by the virus. "Two cases don't make the whole story, but it certainly would be biologically consistent with the [fact]," an infectious disease expert tells ABC. The women contracted the virus, which has now spread to more than 30 countries, while traveling abroad. It is believed to be behind an outbreak of birth defects—and a handful of miscarriages—in Brazil.

Story: – Searchers combing the Java Sea for AirAsia wreckage are closing in on pings they're pretty sure are coming from the doomed plane's black boxes. Three Indonesian ships detected two sets of signals, which the AP describes as "intense," about two miles from where divers yesterday found the plane's tail piece. "The two are close to each other, just about 20 meters (yards)," says one official. "Hopefully, they are the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder." Sonar today revealed wing and engine debris in the vicinity of the pings, reports Sky News; officials believe the recorders are caught beneath the wreckage.

Story: – It started with a conversation last year that Michelle Moon had with her terminally ill daughter, Julianna, about where she'd want to be if she got sick again: in the hospital or at home. Julianna picked home, even if it meant she'd die there, and that's where the 5-year-old peacefully passed away Tuesday, CNN reports. "Our sweet Julianna went to heaven today," Moon wrote on her blog. "I am stunned and heartbroken, but also thankful. … We got almost six years together." In her post, Moon also documented the fight Julianna had waged against her incurable Charcot-Marie-Toot disease and the "startling" words she'd speak that seemed to suggest a more mature understanding of terminal illness than most would expect. Still, Moon, a neurologist, and her husband, Steve Snow, an Air Force pilot, were thrown by the backlash after a CNN story on their family in October. "They are Steve's and my decisions, but we look to Julianna to guide us," Moon rebutted to People in January. And medical experts who worked with the family supported their decision: One hospice nurse said, "I don't know that it's appropriate for every child, but in this scenario it's very appropriate." What hurt the most, Moon says, were judgmental attacks—including the Dear Julianna website, which shows people with neuromuscular disabilities who survived to adulthood—based on a misperception she and her husband had deprived Julianna of medical care. CNN explains doctors had told Julianna's parents if she chose the hospital, there was a "reasonable chance" she'd die anyway and that she'd spend her last days mostly sedated and undergoing painful medical procedures. Instead, Julianna's final bout was quick, Moon told CNN, and "she died at home … in my arms." (This baby who died shortly after birth finished his bucket list before he was born.)

Story: – Australia is doubling its efforts to find missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Though wreckage of the jet was found on Reunion island in July, a search of 29,000 square miles has yet to uncover more. Australia now says two vessels used so far to troll a 46,000-square-mile search area will be increased to four, including one provided by China, per Reuters. The search will also focus on a new "hot spot" at the southern tip of the search area, where officials say MH370 most likely rests based on a new analysis of data, per the BBC. It covers 20 nautical miles on either side of the plane's presumed route after it vanished, reports the Telegraph. The search of the area is expected to wrap up in June.

Story: – Climate change and evolution are as undeniable as E=mc2, says celebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, but "people have lost the ability to judge what is true and what is not." "The sooner you understand that, the faster we can get on with the political conversations about how to solve the problems that face us," he says in a Facebook video, viewed more than 7.7 million times in less than 24 hours. Introduced by Tyson as "containing what may be the most important words I have ever spoken," the four-minute video attacks a decline in scientific literacy in the US, per Business Insider, with Tyson noting that the result could be catastrophic. "Every minute one is in denial" of a scientific truth, "you are delaying the political solution that should have been established years ago," he continues in what Mashable calls an "emotional and raw" tirade. His message is broken up by news reports about skepticism around vaccinations and climate change denial, and a clip of Mike Pence asking that US educators teach evolution as theory. "When you have people who don't know much about science, standing in denial of it, and rising to power, that is a recipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy," Tyson says. Science is "in the service of civilization," he adds. "It's in our hands."

Story: – For a gossip blogger, Perez Hilton certainly was mysterious about the details of his surprise new baby when the little boy was born last month. Now he opens up, revealing to the Los Angeles Times that his son's name is Mario Armando Lavandeira III and that he was born via surrogate. Perez used an anonymous egg donor, and only his mother, sister, lawyer, and business manager knew about the pregnancy. Little Mario (whom the gossip blogger calls "Perez Jr." on his site) was born four weeks early. Perez, who calls being a dad "awesome," turns 35 Saturday, and he always planned to have a child by that time. He's only been in one serious relationship in the past five years, and says he was prepared to be a single parent: "I knew it was going to happen this way because boyfriends and husbands may come and go, but kids are forever. I didn't want to keep waiting." He also discusses his newfound, and much nicer, online persona: "I don't have to give people nasty nicknames anymore. I don't have to say people are stupid, or people are fat, or people are ugly. I don't need to draw inappropriate things on photos or out people. I can still be sassy and fun and do my job."

Story: – As expected, the Senate today rejected a bipartisan effort to expand federal background checks on gun purchasers. An attempt to ban assault-style weapons and a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines were also rejected in a series of showdown votes four months after the Newtown rampage. The background check measure commanded a majority of senators, 54-46, but that was well short of the 60 votes needed to advance. Some of the parents of the Sandy Hook victims watched the votes from the spectators' gallery that rings the Senate floor. They were joined by relatives of victims of other mass shootings in Arizona, Virginia, and Colorado. “Shame on you!” at least two women shouted, reports the Washington Post. The proposal would have required background checks for all transactions at gun shows and online. Currently they must occur for sales handled by licensed gun dealers. Only four Republicans voted in favor of the measure, while five Democrats voted against it, reports the Hill. The Democrats in opposition were Mark Pryor, Max Baucus, Heidi Heitkamp, and Mark Begich. Harry Reid also voted no, but only as a parliamentary maneuver that would allow him to bring up the measure again. The Republicans who bucked their party were co-sponsor Pat Toomey, John McCain, Susan Collins, and Mark Kirk.

Story: – A Long Island man thought July 8, 2015, was going to be "one of the most important" days of his life, but now he's suing Disney World for ruining it. Fox News reports on Marc Rubin's lawsuit, which the 57-year-old filed Sept. 27 in Florida's Orange County Circuit Court, and which outlines how he claims a Disney employee marred his marriage proposal plans. Per his suit, Rubin was planning to ask for his girlfriend's hand in marriage in front of Cinderella Castle on that summer day, but as he was looking for just the right spot to do it, he says he was approached by park worker Nicole Guzman-Ortiz, 24. Per an arrest report, Guzman-Ortiz says she asked Rubin to move three feet to make way for a soon-to-start parade and he refused; in his suit, Rubin says he was waiting for minors he was with to come back from the concession stand and needed to stay in place for "legitimate safety concerns." Per the arrest report on the ensuing argument, Guzman-Ortiz says Rubin then threatened to make sure she was fired and yanked on her shirt collar when she tried to leave, Newsday notes. A manager who arrived on the scene told police he didn't see Rubin grab Guzman-Ortiz's collar, but he did witness Rubin's "arrogance"; he says Rubin grabbed his shirt as well. Rubin was arrested for misdemeanor battery, pleaded no contest to a disorderly conduct charge, and paid a $100 fine, plus court costs. His claim, which asks for at least $15,000 in damages and other costs, notes he's also suing for negligence, claiming the park didn't release surveillance footage that would've shown he never touched anyone. "The safety of the people who work in and visit our parks is very important to us," a Disney rep says in a statement. "We will respond to the allegations as appropriate in court."

Story: – Rutgers University is scrambling to deal with reports that its newly minted athletic director and supposed scandal slayer Julie Hermann has a spotty past of her own—complete with abuse allegations and a sex-discrimination settlement—and emerging emails show bickering and complaints among the very board of trustees that appointed Hermann in the first place. Trustees say they were given the names of two finalists the day before the first was to be interviewed, and they spent only 75 minutes interviewing Hermann, reports the Star-Ledger. "It was not enough time," says one. "Let’s not present this as any kind of exemplary process. Subsequent events have proven otherwise.” The search leaders tried via email to smooth things over, telling trustees, "You all had the opportunity to examine Julie’s credentials, to spend some time with her when she was on campus. As you know, there was strong support for Julie." That prompted a string of emails that the lone student on the search committee likened to "a professional catfight in my email inbox." Adding insult to injury, Rutgers paid an executive search company $70,000 to vet finalists for the job, notes the New York Times; now, the school is also paying a crisis-management company $150,000 to deal with the scandals' fallout.

Story: – After John Galliano's alleged anti-Semitic rant and subsequent arrest, the British fashion designer filed a defamation claim against the couple accusing him. But he may have a harder time defending himself now, because it turns out he was caught on video saying, among other things, "I love Hitler." It's not clear if the cellphone video is from Thursday night's incident or another time, although it was filmed in the same cafe, the Telegraph reports. Galliano is heard slurring, "People like you would be dead. Your mothers, your forefathers, would all be f***ing gassed." The people in the group to whom he was speaking were French and Italian, not Jewish, the Sun reports. When asked if he has a problem, Galliano replies, "With you. You're ugly." Then, when asked where he's from: "Your a**hole." (Watch the video here.) Meanwhile, Galliano denies the incident for which he was arrested, claiming that his accuser actually insulted him, not the other way around—and that her boyfriend threatened him with a chair. New York magazine takes a look at the conflicting reports surrounding the incident; at least one witness supports Galliano and says the couple started the problem. Vogue UK adds that a second woman filed a police complaint against Galliano Saturday alleging anti-Semitic remarks, in an incident which may or may not be related to Thursday's.

Story: – What's in a name? About $32,000 apparently, if you want one that's unique. A new Swiss company called Erfolgswelle offers to create a list of globally unique baby names and pare them down with clients until they pick one, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. "We follow a creation process that takes around 100 hours," company CEO Marc Hauser tells BuzzFeed. For $32,000, copywriters cook up names, historians ensure their uniqueness, translators check they won't offend in any language, and lawyers make sure they aren't trademarked. Then, presto, you get a list from which to choose five favorites. Erfolgswelle will even send your faves to 780 people who pick their faves. Yet "the family is always in charge—they have the rudder in their hands," says Hauser. Once a favorite is picked (Blue Ivy and Apple are taken, people!) the company writes up a mythology and history of the name. "Based on the elements of the new name, we create a story with a positive message," Hauser says. "That’s why all the parts of the name need a positive message in it." He promises a personal touch, too, telling ABC News that each name must fit "within the family's culture and background." He won't reveal their client list, baby names, or tricks of the trade, but tells the Daily Mail that the name must "roll off the tongue," so, for example, no first name will end "with the same letter that the surname begins with." Little problem: Once the name is out there, anyone can use it. "Alternatively, you could just call the kid Elsa and promise to take her to Disney World when she’s 10," says Metro. (See why parents aren't allowed to name their baby Nutella.)

Story: – Conspiracy theories, buzzing Reddit threads, and an outpouring of concern this week over … Howard Stern taking a day off. Page Six reports that the SiriusXM radio host abruptly dropped off the airwaves this week when he unexpectedly took a "personal day" Wednesday, per the on-air message explaining his absence (he didn't return Thursday or Friday, either, adding to the worry). Longtime fans who know his work ethic, and apparently his attendance record, expressed their concern for his sudden disappearance. "I am very concerned," tweeted one fan who says he's been a listener since the '80s and "NEVER" recalled the host cancelling a show, while another sent "peace and love" to his "hero." Per Page Six and Campus News, some of the speculations about Howard's whereabouts include co-host Robin Quivers being "gravely ill"; his wife, Beth Ostrosky, being angry with him; and the IRS being after him for airing a confidential agency call. One Reddit user made an even more uneasy observation: "Just this year Howard said the only way he'd cancel a show is if a parent died." But Radar says it touched base with Stern's mom, Ray, on Thursday, and she insists her husband, Ben, who's been reported as being seriously ill, is OK (Ray noted he wasn't home when Radar rang). Some fans say Stern was in a down mood on Monday's show and are trying to connect the dots from there. Page Six notes there's been no word from SiriusXM, though Stern is expected to be back behind the mic on Monday.

Story: – Thanks to bad weather, North Korea's anticipated rocket launch did not come to pass today, but Pyongyang still appears determined to go through with the launch—or, as the US and other allies see it, a long-range missile test—sometime before Monday, the AP reports. But the Los Angeles Times points out that North Korea has tried for similar launches three times already—and Western experts say all three attempts failed. North Korea first claimed a successful launch in 1998, but experts say no evidence of a satellite was actually found. The second attempt, in 2006, "was more or less a catastrophe," says one analyst; the rocket failed 40 seconds after lifting off. The last attempt, in 2009, is believed to have been an improvement but still to have failed in the final stage and fallen into the ocean. When this fourth attempt occurs, the AP offers things to watch, including: Will it actually get into orbit? The three stages take about 10 minutes; if all goes well, the satellite will be in orbit at that point. Will it stay on course? Experts believe the probe will need to achieve some difficult navigation very quickly after liftoff in order to get into its proper orbit. If it veers toward Japan or South Korea, the two nations have promised to shoot it down. Will we detect any broadcasts? The satellite is supposed to be broadcasting music in celebration of North Korea's founder. If the launch is successful, western Australia could pick up the broadcasts within 20 minutes.

How might the launch be perceived by the international community, and what kind of response might it elicit from other countries?
Story: – A combination of factors led to last year's crash of an Asiana Airlines jet in San Francisco, but the one that tops the list of a new report is a straightforward one: "flight crew mismanagement." Federal investigators say the South Korean pilots should have realized that their automatic throttle was bringing them in too low and too slow and overridden it in time, reports the San Francisco Chronicle and the AP. The big problem is that the crew "over-relied on automated systems that they did not fully understand," says Christopher Hart, acting chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB, therefore, wants Boeing to provide better training for its increasingly complex systems. "In their efforts to compensate for the unreliability of human performance, the designers of automated control systems have unwittingly created opportunities for new error types that can be even more serious than those they were seeking to avoid," says Hart. The report also says the pilots were fatigued at the end of the flight, which didn't help. Three people were killed in the crash, including one young woman who was hit by emergency vehicles. The report generally praised the emergency response but cites problems with training and radio communications.
Summary: 1. What specific actions did the flight crew take that led to the crash, according to the report?2. How did the crew's reliance on automated systems contribute to the crash, according to the NTSB?3. What is the significance of the fact that the pilots were fatigued at the end of the flight, according to the report?4. How does the report's finding that the designers of automated control systems have created new opportunities for error relate to the broader issue of technological advancements in aviation safety?5. What are some potential implications of the report's recommendation that Boeing provide better training for its increasingly complex systems?6. How does the report's criticism of the pilots' lack of understanding of the automated systems contrast with the generally praised emergency response?7. What are some potential ways to address the issue of fatigue among pilots, particularly in long-haul flights?8. How does the crash of Asiana Airlines jet in San Francisco relate to broader issues in aviation safety, such as the balance between automation and human oversight?9.

Story: – Shia LaBeouf isn't the only artist protesting President Trump—but in Christo's case, it's the lack of art that will do the talking. The artist famous for installing 7,503 orange "gates" at Central Park in 2005 had planned for some 20 years to drape 1,000 silver fabric panels over 42 miles of the Arkansas River in Colorado using steel cables fixed to the banks at a cost of $50 million. But now he says he'll do no such thing, despite spending $15 million of his own money on the Over the River project, because the land is federally owned and therefore under Trump's control. "I can't do a project that benefits this landlord," the 81-year-old tells the New York Times, adding the "pleasure" he took in the project has gone with Trump's election. After various court wins, a single federal lawsuit was all that stood in Christo's way, with opponents worried about the project's effect on wildlife, reports the Denver Post. But Christo says one more legal victory won't change his mind. "I am not excited about the project anymore," he says. Over the River, conceived in 1992 with his late wife Jeanne-Claude, would've been Christo's largest ever artwork in the US, to be installed over two years and on display for only two weeks. Instead, its absence will be "a decisive statement," per the Atlantic, that after years of fighting for governments to approve his projects, "reaching across the aisle, in a sense, and finding common ground," Christo believes "that common ground no longer exists." It was the final project he and his wife had planned for the US. (Speaking of LaBeouf, he was arrested outside his own protest.)
Summary: 1. What is the Over the River project, and why was it significant for Christo?2. How did Christo's plans for the project change due to President Trump's election?3.

Story: – The Secret Service scandal has cost three agency employees their jobs so far, reports AP. (One quit, one supervisor retired, and another supervisor is in the process of being fired.) The New York Times, meanwhile, scored an interview with the 24-year-old escort at the heart of the case, the one whose argument with an agent over payment—"I tell him, 'Baby, my cash money'"—sparked the whole mess. Among the details: She says a group of US men approached her and a friend at a disco, and she agreed to accompany one guy back to his hotel for $800. The agents were "very discreet" and never said they were with the president. The next morning, her client said he didn't remember the deal, gave her $30, and ordered her from the room. She made a scene in the hallway, and other Americans got her about $225, so she left. By then, however, hotel security and local cops were on the scene.

Story: – Dan Tillery was so excited to adopt his pup, Diggy (nee Sir Wiggleton), who had spent 100 days in a Detroit shelter, that they made a music video and took a beaming photo together that went viral on social media. "We know this photo is going to break the internet and we apologize, but we had to share!" Detroit Dog Rescue's Facebook page gushed June 6. But that thrill was short-lived when Waterford Township cops got wind of the adoption and informed the Michigan man he had until Monday to "relocate" Diggy because they say he's a pit bull—a breed banned by a local ordinance, MLive.com reports. Waterford police tell WWJ they received multiple complaints about Diggy and headed to Tillery's house Thursday. "When they went to the gate [to] actually see him, he licked their face," Tillery says, noting officers took photos of Diggy. They informed him later that day that they had concluded Diggy was a pit bull. But Detroit Dog Rescue says in a follow-up post that Diggy isn't a pit bull, but an "American Bulldog who can't stop smiling." Supporting documents from a vet and Detroit's animal control department also contend Diggy is a bulldog. Some experts say "too many dogs are painted with the 'pit bull' brush," the Washington Post notes, and others maintain pit bull bans are unethical to begin with, per the Christian Science Monitor. For now, however, Waterford officials are sticking with their pit bull definition (they used guidelines from the American Kennel Club) and say Diggy has to go. Police say Tillery has indicated he'll comply; he could face a civil infraction and $500 fine if he refuses. Meanwhile, more than 50,000 have signed an online petition to overturn Waterford's "dangerous dog" ban. The Post notes that if Diggy is found to be a prohibited pup, he can be destroyed. (A pit bull burned in a fire is now an honorary firefighter.)

Story: – A former Trump campaign aide has decided 18 months in prison for fraud-related charges is the best deal he's going to get from Robert Mueller's team, insiders tell the Los Angeles Times. The sources say that in return for leniency, Rick Gates plans to change his plea to guilty and will testify against former campaign chief Paul Manafort, who worked with him in political consulting for around 10 years. Both men are accused of money laundering and other offenses related to their work in Ukraine. One of the Times' sources says Gates, who has four children, can't afford an expensive legal team to defend him in the Mueller probe. If "you go to trial on this, that's $1 million to $1.5 million," the source says. Sources tell CNN that Gates had hoped to benefit from a legal defense fund, but major GOP donors aren't interested in coughing up money to defend him and Manafort. Gates, 45, joined the Trump campaign in June 2016, the same time as Manafort, but stayed on long after Manafort was fired in August. One of the Times' sources says Gates' testimony against Manafort could be the "cherry on top" of Mueller's case, though he doesn't believe Gates has information that would help "turn the screws on Trump." The New York Times reports that on Friday, the Justice Department disclosed that California computer specialist Richard Pinedo had pleaded guilty to identity theft and was cooperating with the investigation of 13 Russians charged with interfering in the 2016 election. He allegedly used stolen identities to set up bank accounts used by the Russians.

Story: – Remember when Hurricane Katrina spurred Kanye West to say that George W. Bush didn't care about black people? Well, this is kinda like that—except it involves a reporter, not a celebrity. Seems a hot mic caught Yahoo News Washington bureau chief David Chalian saying today, during a webcast, that Mitt and Ann Romney are "not concerned at all" about the effects of Hurricane Isaac on African Americans. "They're happy to have a party with black people drowning," Chalian continued, apparently referencing the Republican National Convention. Not surprisingly, he was promptly fired, a source tells Politico. A Yahoo News rep later confirmed: "David Chalian's statement was inappropriate and does not represent the views of Yahoo," reads the statement. "He has been terminated effective immediately. We have already reached out to the Romney campaign, and we apologize to Mitt Romney, his staff, their supporters, and anyone who was offended." Newsbusters was first to make note of Chalian's quote.

Story: – Scott Baio seems to enjoy tweeting offensive things and then watching as outrage ensues. The latest controversy started when good old Charles in Charge tweeted that his taxes would pay the way of “lazy non working people,” and Jezebel posted the tweet. Baio wasn’t too happy, calling the folks over at Jezebel “ignorant” and “racist,” among other things. Then his wife got involved, and things really got ugly. Renee Baio went on a Facebook rant of Courtney Love proportions, calling the Jezebel staffers “lesbian shitasses” and bemoaning their “cuntness," all while attempting to escape the label of “homophobe” by proudly declaring, “I have lesbian friends that couldn’t be nicer.” Scott defended the whole thing, maintaining that “we all have the right to exercise our freedom of speech.” The Huffington Post sums up the chain of events nicely.

Story: – Herman Cain was in trouble with women voters even before sexual harassment allegations surfaced, the Washington Post finds. Recent polls found Mitt Romney to be around 10 points ahead of Cain with female votes. In Iowa, where the two are neck-and-neck, 26% of men support Cain and 18% support Romney, while among women, Romney has 27% to Cain’s 17%, according to the Des Moines Register. The Christian group Conservative Women for America has asked Cain to explain the allegations. The group's president tells Politico that she once left a job because of sexual harassment so she has first-hand experience of how serious the issue is. She does, however, stress that "this characterization is completely contrary to the Herman Cain I know."

Story: – So, how 'bout them Walmart protests? Apparently the demonstrations had little impact on the company's business, because according to the Sacramento Bee, Walmart has reported its best-ever Black Friday and says it served 22 million customers yesterday alone. Among the astounding numbers: Since last night, Walmart has sold 1.3 million TVs and 1.8 million ... towels? Yes, towels. The company's president and CEO says just 26 store protests took place, and "many of them did not include any Walmart associates." He estimates less than 50 actual Walmart workers took part. The Atlantic Wire doesn't see how that could possibly be correct, but thinks the group organizing the protests is probably exaggerating, too—it claims strikes in 100 cities, 1,000 protests, and "hundreds and hundreds" walking off the job. Reuters reports that at one Chicago Walmart, just one single employee out of 500 took part, but four busloads of protesters eventually joined him. A protest at a California Walmart was particularly big, with 1,000 people taking part; nine of them were arrested peacefully after refusing to disperse, the Los Angeles Times reports.

Story: – Peter Jackson's first Hobbit film didn't exactly wow critics. They're not gushing about Desolation of Smaug either, but most seem to agree that it's an improvement, with more action than its predecessor, and it's boasting a healthy 75% as of this writing on Rotten Tomatoes. Here's a taste of what they're saying: "Jackson gets the drama in gear here from the outset with a sense of storytelling that possesses palpable energy and purpose," writes Todd McCarthy at the Hollywood Reporter, although "with prolonged exposure to this tale comes awareness of some of the premise's limitations." Suspense, for example "cannot be a factor" because the elves are immortal, and the dwarves seemingly so. "You'd think a few dwarves might be sacrificed, but nope, they're all charmed." If the first Hobbit was a little boring and a lot long, "The Desolation of Smaug is a little less long and a little less boring," writes Peter Travers at Rolling Stone."But, oh, that dragon." It's all worth it for Smaug; Jackson works the same wizardry he did on Gollum, making the dragon "a bloody wonder of slithering fright. And Benedict Cumberbatch gives him a voice to match." His scenes "imbue this bloated 3D movie with a sense of character and purpose." "JRR Tolkein would be outraged beyond belief" at the liberties Jackson has taken, writes Alex O'Hehir at Salon. But "I'm kind of OK with it. I mean, introducing a love affair between a rebel Elf chick and a hot dwarf dude is so far beyond anything Tolkien would ever have countenanced that it amounts to a declaration of independence. This trilogy has become its own thing," and that thing is "a rip-snorting, barrel-riding adventure" that's pretty fun. But Mick LaSalle is, um, a little more negative. The movie "should never have been made," he writes at the San Francisco Chronicle. It "fails in almost every way, as a story, as an adventure, as a piece of art direction, and as a visual spectacle." Its colors are drab, its character development missing in action. "The story is just sitting there waiting while Orlando Bloom goes through the motions of stabbing various monsters in the head."
Summary: 1. What are the main criticisms of Peter Jackson's first Hobbit film, and how does The Desolation of Smaug address these criticisms?2. How does Jackson work his "wizardry" to make Smaug a compelling character, and what role does Benedict Cumberbatch's voice acting play in this?3. How does the addition of a love affair between an Elf and a dwarf in the film differ from JRR Tolkien's original work, and what does this say about the film's independence from the source material?4. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the film as a visual spectacle, according to the critics reviewed in the text? How does it compare to Jackson's previous work in the Lord of the Rings trilogy?5.

Story: – "There's mass confusion," William Simpich tells the Los Angeles Times. He's the attorney who on Friday filed a federal lawsuit over California's Democratic presidential primary, and the particulars of the case are a bit confusing as well. When Californians elect California officials, they can vote for anyone on the ballot, regardless of party. The same isn't true for the political primaries, which take place in the state June 7. In this case, the parties make the rules. Only registered Republicans can cast a ballot for a Republican candidate, but the Democrats are allowing residents with "no party preference" to vote—kind of. The Bernie Sanders-supporting Voting Rights Defense Project is among the plaintiffs, who want state elections officials to be required to launch a public awareness campaign between now and May 31, the last day for requesting a ballot by mail. The ballot by mail is the real point of contention. As KPCC explains, "no party preference" voters can ask for a "crossover ballot" that lets them vote in the Democratic primary. Simpich tells the station that if they don't ask for that ballot, and write in Sanders or Hillary Clinton on the blank ballot they will be sent, it "won't count." A local voter analytics expert tells the San Francisco Chronicle, "The Democratic (primary) was sold to voters as an open primary, but ... it's more like a closed primary with an option for people to get into it." And it's not a paltry sum: He says about 2.1 million independents vote via mail in the state. The plaintiffs would also like to see voter registration go right up to June 7. New York Magazine notes the reported confusion is a legitimate concern for Sanders, whose "support among independents has given him a boost in almost every Democratic primary to date."

Story: – A New York City statue went from "fearless" to "fearful" Friday—at least for an hour. Manuel Oliver, the father of Parkland shooting victim Joaquin "Guac" Oliver, 17, placed a bulletproof vest on the renowned "Fearless Girl" statue near Wall Street to protest America's mass shootings, the Hill reports. The vest, removed an hour later, read simply, "#FearfulGirl." "She can't be fearless if she's afraid to go to school," tweeted Change the Ref, a gun-control group started by Manuel and his wife Patricia Oliver, per Huffington Post. In October, Oliver unveiled a 3D-printed statue of his son holding a flower to protest 3D-printed firearms, ABC News reported. (The statue is slated to be moved later this year.)

Story: – Just a few days after Andrew Breitbart ran a cartoon basically calling her fat, Michelle Obama and her anti-obesity campaign came under attack again, this time from Michele Bachmann. The Minnesota congresswoman and Tea Party favorite ripped Obama's push to advocate breastfeeding as part of the fight against childhood obesity, Politico reports. "To think that government has to go out and buy my breast pump for my babies? You wanna talk about the nanny state, I think you just got a new definition,” Bachmann said yesterday on Laura Ingraham's radio show. Bachmann, Ingraham, and some of her callers also speculated that Obama's attempts at passing legislation hint that she may run for office someday. Bachmann called the first lady's agenda “very consistent with where the hard left is coming from. For them, government is the answer to every problem,” she said. “And so government got us in this problem, and so they think government is going to get us out of the problem. Clearly they’re wrong.” Click for more of Bachmann's comments.

Story: – The tatters of a severe tropical cyclone called Typhoon Nuri collided with cold air over Alaska's Aleutian Islands this past weekend, earning it the nickname "bomb cyclone" (akin to the conditions that set off Superstorm Sandy in 2012). The resulting burst of "violent energy," reports CNN, is expected to send much of the northern US into a frigid and frosty state, with temps likely to dip below zero in parts of Montana and snow likely to accumulate to a foot or higher in parts of Minnesota. The weather is atypical, especially for this time of year, with Nuri becoming the strongest known Northern Pacific cyclone on record, reports the National Weather Service Ocean Prediction Center. While snow is supposed to blanket much of the Rockies, northern Plains, and Great Lakes, the cold front will peter out before reaching the Deep South and Southwest, which are expected to continue to feel autumnal. (Several months ago, the Farmers' Almanac predicted a cold season, particularly from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes.)

Story: – Authorities on Monday called for 2,000 volunteers to help in a ground search for clues in the disappearance of a Wisconsin girl whose parents were gunned down in their home last week. After an initial ground search on Thursday in which 100 volunteers helped search for clues into 13-year-old Jayme Closs' disappearance, Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald said such searches wouldn't resume unless investigators received a tip that justified them continuing. Fitzgerald told the AP on Monday that "something triggered" the decision to conduct another ground search that starts Tuesday, but he declined to elaborate. He said he didn't know the exact area of the search but said it would include the land around Jayme's home near Barron, a rural western Wisconsin city about 80 miles northeast of Minneapolis. The sheriff's department received a 911 call from Jayme's mother's cellphone just before 1am on Oct. 15; no one spoke, but "a lot of yelling" was heard, ABC News reports. Responding deputies found someone had kicked in the door and that Jayme's parents had been shot to death inside. Jayme, who isn't a suspect in the killings, was missing. The sheriff's department, state Department of Justice, and FBI have been searching for Jayme since she vanished. Investigators have received more than 1,200 tips and have looked into more than 1,000 of them, according to the sheriff's department. The department posted a message on its Facebook page Monday asking for 2,000 volunteers to assist in the next ground search, which was scheduled to begin at 9am on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Jayme's classmates planned to hold a vigil for her Monday evening at the Barron High School football stadium. (The teen was home when her parents were killed.)

Story: – It's only been three years since fans said goodbye to the iPod Classic, but they'll now have to prep for another period of nostalgia-infused mourning. "Today, we are simplifying our iPod lineup," an Apple spokesperson said in a Thursday statement, per TechCrunch. The company has confirmed it will be discontinuing its iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle MP3 players. That means there's only one Apple device left that we can still call iPod: the Touch. What appears to have doomed the Nano and Shuffle was the shift to iPhones and streaming music, and as both the Shuffle and Nano had limited (if any) apps capability, they fell behind the curve—and Apple didn't bother bringing them up to speed. To celebrate the last player standing, Apple is boosting the iPod Touch's capacity, upping the 16GB version that sells for $199 to 32GB, and the $299 64GB model to 128GB; the 16GB and 64GB models will no longer be for sale, Ars Technica reports. Already feeling a pang of wistfulness? The Verge notes you may still be able to find Nano and Shuffle models at big-box stores and other retailers until their inventory runs out. Plus: There's always eBay. (Remember when the Nano was a big deal?)

Story: – The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is reporting what it calls a "new massacre" near Aleppo. At least 65 people have been found dead, all apparently shot in the head, and all with their arms tied behind their backs, Reuters reports. The death toll could rise as high as 80, the rights group said. It's unclear which faction in the country's ongoing civil war killed them. The incident comes as Syrian rebels scored a major victory today, taking a government intelligence compound in the eastern city of Deir al-Zor after five days of fighting, and freeing at least 11 prisoners held within, the AP reports.

Story: – This turned out to be a banner week for the Atlanta Braves pitching staff. In the most high-profile event, the team today placed pitching coach Roger McDowell on administrative leave after he allegedly hurled gay slurs at heckling Giants fans ("Are you a homo couple or a threesome?"), simulated a sex act with a bat, and used the same bat to threaten a man who asked him to tone down his language in front of kids. ("How much are your teeth worth?") He could face harsher punishment once the team finishes its investigation, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Celebrity attorney Gloria Allred is on the case on behalf of the fans. In the other incident, pitcher Derek Lowe got arrested last night and charged with DUI, notes the AJ-C.

Story: – Seattle Mayor Ed Murray has been accused in a lawsuit of sexually molesting a teenage high-school dropout in the 1980s, the AP reports. Two other men tell the Seattle Times that Murray abused them in the 1980s, when they lived in an Oregon center for troubled children. The allegations were denied by Murray through a spokesman, who said: "These false accusations are intended to damage a prominent elected official who has been a defender of vulnerable populations for decades. It is not a coincidence that this shakedown effort comes within weeks of the campaign filing deadline." In the suit filed in King County Superior Court, a 46-year-old identified only as D.H. said Murray "raped and molested him" over several years, beginning in 1986, when he was 15 and addicted to crack and Murray was in his early 30s. Murray paid him $10 to $20 for each of at least 50 encounters over four to five years, the lawsuit says. "I have been dealing with this for over 30 years," the man told the Times, adding he was coming forward as part of a "healing process." The paper also reports two other men accused Murray of abusing them in the 1980s and paying them for sex, and they're willing to testify. Jeff Simpson and Lloyd Anderson say they knew Murray when they lived in the Portland center for troubled kids. The Times says one of them talked with a social worker and detective then; no charges were filed. Simpson and Anderson raised the allegations a decade ago and repeated them in recent interviews. Having sex with a child under 16—the state's age of legal consent in 1986 and now—constitutes rape of a child. The statute of limitations on any crime would have expired long ago.

Story: – As long as politicians keep speaking, fact-checkers will have work to do—and Tuesday night's Republican debate kept them as busy as ever. Some of the more dubious claims from the candidates, via the AP, the Washington Post, and the New York Times: Marco Rubio: "Welders make more money than philosophers." This is way off, according to PayScale. The pay analysis firm says philosophy majors have starting salaries of around $40,000, which is close to the median for welders throughout their careers, the Times notes. But by the time the philosophy grads are mid-career, they're taking in an average of $81,200. Ben Carson, talking about Syria: "You know, the Chinese are there, as well as the Russians, and you have all kinds of factions there." The Carson campaign declined to clarify this statement to the Post, but there have been no reports of Chinese troops active in Syria. Donald Trump: "I will tell you, I don't have to give you a website because I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm putting up my own money." Trump is no longer self-funding his campaign: According to his most recent campaign finance filing, he gave his campaign $100,000 in the most recent quarter. It received another $3.8 million in unsolicited donations. Carson again: "Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases." Economists are split on whether raising the minimum wage to $15 will be a job-killer, the Times reports, and six of the 11 minimum-wage hikes since 1978 were followed by job growth, according to a PolitiFact analysis. Jeb Bush: "We have to recognize that small businesses right now, more of them are closing than are being set up." That statistic is out of date now, and it was out of date when Marco Rubio used it in the last debate, the Post notes. A Brookings Institution report in 2014 found that more businesses closed than opened between 2008 and 2011, but the trend started to reverse in 2012.

Story: – You and I can't get away with a 5-ounce bottle of shampoo at the airport, but a North Korean diplomat apparently thought the 27 kilograms of gold in his carry-on—worth about $1.4 million—was no big deal. Bangladesh would beg to differ, reports the Wall Street Journal. "We recovered the gold both in the form of bar and ornaments from Son Young Nam, the First Secretary of the North Korean Embassy in Dhaka," said a top official, per Reuters. Son was detained and released, but Bangladesh seized his treasure and is looking to press criminal charges in addition to the customs complaint already filed.

Story: – A Utah man who was hiding from police and fled arrest had to call 911 to be rescued after getting stuck in his hiding spot. Salt Lake City police say 46-year-old Shane Paul Owen called dispatchers for help on Tuesday, more than six hours after he accidentally locked himself in a old, vacant church's boiler room. Officers were looking for Owens on Monday because he is a suspect in a string of burglaries and had warrants out for his arrest. Police say an officer spotted him and attempted to pull his vehicle over, but Owen fled, got out of his car and ran into the church, the AP reports. Fearing that Owens was armed, police called in a SWAT team, which surrounded the church and was about to enter when the suspect called to be rescued. "They’ve had me tied up here all night," he told the 911 dispatcher. "I'm not going to be able to put my hands up and climb out." Police say they were initially skeptical, but they took Owens into custody without incident after sending a robot to check that he was really in the basement boiler room, which had no door handles on the inside, KSL reports. Police say they recovered drugs from Owen and booked him on warrants for retaliation against a witness, drug distribution, and identity fraud. (Police found this car thief hiding up a tree.)

Story: – Jon Stewart will be joining his former Daily Show understudy John Oliver at HBO, according to a press release from the premium cable network. “Jon Stewart led a revolution that changed the face of TV comedy on The Daily Show,” HBO executive Michael Lombardo says. “He graced our network nearly 20 years ago [in a stand-up special, Unleavened], so we’re thrilled to welcome back his immense talents in this next chapter of his career.” Stewart signed a four-year production deal with HBO that will initially have him creating short-form digital content for HBO GO and HBO NOW. “Appearing on television 22 minutes a night clearly broke me," Stewart says. "I’m pretty sure I can produce a few minutes of content every now and again.” For his first project with HBO, the Verge reports Stewart will be working with a graphics company that did motion-capture work on Spider-Man 3 and The Social Network to produce timely content about current events. But it's uncertain what that content will actually look like. "It's clear Stewart is ready to head back into the fray. Just not every single day," the Verge notes. (Either that, or he wanted to take advantage of HBO's relaxed attitude about nudity.) According to the Hollywood Reporter, the deal also gives HBO first-look at any other projects from Stewart. But more importantly, it puts the former Daily Show host on the same network as Sesame Street, which can only mean the return of everyone's favorite America-hating muppet isn't far off. (Stewart could also have professional wrestling in his future...)

Story: – A 20-year-old Russian man has emerged from a Siberian forest after spending 16 years living there. The man says he and his hermit parents moved there when he was 4. His folks finally left in May, and locals say they then decided to head to an island off Russia's Pacific coast—and they didn't invite their son, report AFP and RT News. "He has no education, no social skills, and no ideas about the world beyond the forest," says a local prosecutor, per RIA Novosti. But "he looked normal and healthy; he only spoke slowly, since he doesn't communicate as often as most people." It's a little unclear how he was discovered: AFP says he set off for a village in search of help as summer ended; RT reports a woman discovered him and brought him to authorities. Police are searching for the man's parents, reports RT, but even if they find them, they're unlikely to face charges, as prosecutors "have no evidence" of neglect or abuse. The prosecutor's office has applied to get the man ID documents so that he might be eligible for social services—though it's not clear that he wants them: He has already returned to his forest home, described by RT as a "mud hut." He is "now still there, in his dugout, getting ready for winter, collecting firewood," says the prosecutor, per RIA Novosti. RT notes that such cases of feral children aren't unheard of in Russia; it lists three others.

How did the woman discover the man in the forest, and what was her reaction when she found him? Did she show any signs of shock or surprise upon realizing that he had been living in the forest for so long?5. Why are the police searching for the man's parents, and what are the possible charges they might face? Is there any evidence of neglect or abuse, or is it purely a precautionary measure?6. How will the prosecutor's office help the man obtain ID documents, and what are the potential benefits of having these documents? Is the man interested in obtaining them, or does he prefer to continue living in the forest?7. What is the significance of the fact that this is not the first time a feral child has been found in Russia? Are there any common patterns or characteristics among these cases, or are they unique in some way?8. How does the man's story compare to other known cases of feral children around the world? Are there any similarities or differences in their experiences and living conditions?9. What are the potential long-term effects of living in isolation for such a long period of time on a person's mental and physical health? How might the man's experience in the forest have impacted his behavior and personality?10. Finally, what kind of support and care will the man need to help him readjust to society after living in the forest for so long? Will he require any specialized help or therapy to cope with his unique situation?

Story: – With South Carolina taking down the confederate flag and NASCAR banning it, Kid Rock chose to defend his own use of the Old South emblem: In his words, protesters can "kiss my ass." The rocker was reacting to people who opposed his display at the Detroit Historical Museum, which included the Confederate Flag but may not anymore, Rolling Stone reports. Rock sent a statement to Megyn Kelly at Fox News, saying, "Please tell the people who are protesting to kiss my ass/Ask me some questions." Kelly quoted it in a video available on her Facebook page, editing his words to read, "kiss my ... ask me some questions," she says. "I modified that." Raised in Michigan, Rock lives on an estate in Alabama and uses the Confederate flag "to highlight his Rebel Soul, the name of his 2012 album," Rolling Stone says. He has also toured with Lynyrd Skynyrd, a southern band that often used the Confederate flag. But Rock isn't using the flag on his current tour. While Rock says he hasn't raised the flag to symbolize hate, a reverend at Michigan Chapter of the National Action Network tells MLive.com that if the flag stays up, the museum is "consenting to this attitude and this promotion of the flag that we feel is a hate symbol."

Story: – Campus police are investigating what they say might be a hate crime at Harvard Law School: Someone put strips of black tape across several portraits of black professors outside a lecture hall on Thursday, reports WCVB. The scene appeared a day after students rallied in solidarity with those fighting racial injustices on other campuses across the country, reports the Boston Globe. "You see things like that and it hurts you," says the president of the Black Law Student Association. "This is some coward or somebody who thought this was an appropriate reaction. And it hurts." The New York Times reports the tape may have come from a separate protest: Some students placed tape over mats that included the law school's seal because it includes the crest of a slave-owning family. "This is my portrait at Harvard Law School," a professor tweeted, per the Times, alongside a photo showing a piece of tape positioned across his face. The "saddened and angered" dean of Harvard Law School says university police are "investigating the incident as a hate crime." The black tape didn't stay in place for long, though, with notes of encouragement quickly replacing it. Among warm comments about each of the professors were the words, "We Love Our Black Faculty." "I think it's beautiful to see so many examples of love and collective uplift right now," says one student. Others have since voiced a number of concerns regarding race on campus, including that just 12 of 125 full-time faculty members are black.

Story: – "Medics transporting a teenager with life threatening injuries to HMC after a fall of aprox 60ft from a roof on Summit Ave E," read a tweet from Seattle's fire department on Saturday, referring to 16-year-old Hamza Warsame, who died from injuries apparently sustained in that fall, the Seattle Times reports. Hamza—a Somali-American who attended a local high school but was also enrolled at Seattle Central College as part of an accelerated state program—fell off the balcony of an apartment near the college, and some in the city's Muslim community are now claiming he was beaten and pushed to his death by a white man, per the New York Times. The King County Medical Examiner hasn't released the cause or manner of death, the Seattle Times notes, but some are branding it a hate crime. Recent attacks in the US and abroad have been exacerbated by statements in the political arena, especially from Donald Trump, who's said he'd support a database to track Muslims and that the US should ban all Muslims from entering. KUOW reports Hamza's parents say police have put forth a "minimal" response, and were told no one had been assigned to their son's case. "This really … angered the parents—why the police treat this case like it's nothing," the manager of Hamza's college program says. The Seattle PD is imploring the public to "be patient and avoid jumping to conclusions" while it investigates. Meanwhile, supporters of Hamza's family have set up a Facebook page and Twitter hashtag of #Justice4Hamza. "He was not suicidal," Hamza's sister tells the New York Times. "I want my brother's investigation to be put on a priority."

"Some kind of argument" broke out between DeGraw and the group of men who beat him, a police source tells People; DeGraw told police there were at least three assailants but he "can't clearly recall" what they fought about. Police sources say that's due to both his head injuries and the fact that he could have been drunk at the time. The New York Daily News reports DeGraw had been out drinking with friends, but it's still not clear what he was doing alone on the streets at the time of the incident. He has canceled his performances through Saturday.

Story: – A Chinese student is suing her government over medical textbooks that classify homosexuality as a mental disorder that can be cured through shock therapy. Twenty-year-old Qui Bai—whose family turned away from her when they found out she was gay—was looking for answers about her sexuality two years ago when she found the offending passages in textbooks published by China's education ministry, NBC News reports. "I thought textbooks should be trustworthy, but when I saw these lines I felt horrible," she says. "This is discrimination against homosexuality." According to the Washington Post, the ministry ignored Qui's letter asking it to correct the books—the Chinese Psychiatric Association hasn't classified homosexuality as a mental disorder since 2001—and she filed a lawsuit in August. The New York Times reports two-dozen supporters waved signs and a rainbow flag outside a Chinese courthouse during a discussion between Qui and education officials Tuesday. While nothing was settled, Qui and her lawyer say it was a minor victory to even have the discussion while China continues to crack down on activists and human-rights lawyers. Discrimination against homosexuals is prevalent in China, and experts say with little in the way of sex education, medically accurate textbooks are essential, according to the Post. "Because textbooks are seen as having authority, everyone—including the students, the teachers, and the parents—believes them," one activist tells the Post. NBC reports 40% of textbooks still classified homosexuality as a disease as of 2014. "This case is not even close to ending,"Qui says. "I won't give it up."
Summary: 1. What is the legal basis for Qui Bai's lawsuit against the Chinese government? What specific laws or regulations is she citing in her complaint?2. How did Qui Bai first discover the offending passages in the medical textbooks, and what was her initial reaction to them?3.

What is the broader context of the crackdown on activists and human-rights lawyers in China, and how does it relate to the government's stance on LGBTQ+ rights?7. How does Qui Bai's determination to pursue the lawsuit despite the challenges she has faced reflect the resilience and determination of LGBTQ+ individuals in China and around the world?8. What are some potential strategies for advocating for LGBTQ+ rights in China, given the challenges and limitations faced by activists and advocates in the country?9. How can international organizations and governments support LGBTQ+ individuals in China and other countries where discrimination and marginalization are prevalent?10. What are the long-term implications of this lawsuit and the broader struggle for LGBTQ+ rights in China, both domestically and internationally?
Story: – Looks like North America's tallest mountain won't be Mount McKinley anymore. President Obama announced today that Sally Jewell, the secretary of the interior, has renamed it Denali—restoring a name that Alaska Natives and state residents have used for years, Alaska Dispatch News reports. "I think for people like myself that have known the mountain as Denali for years and certainly for Alaskans, it's something that's been a long time coming," says Jewell. The "secretarial order," released the day before Obama's three-day trip to Alaska, appears to end a longstanding battle between Alaska and Ohio over who gets to name the 20,000-foot peak. A gold prospector christened the mountain in 1896 after hearing that William McKinley—not yet a US president—had just won the Republican presidential nomination, the New York Times reports. But Alaska Natives had long called it Denali (which means "the great one" or "the high one") and revered it in the creation story of Koyukon Athabascans, who have lived in Alaska long before the US existed. For decades, Alaska has filed a bill every year to change the peak's name to Denali and saw the move blocked by legislators in Ohio, McKinley's home state. Ohio officials haven't yet said whether they'll try to block the name change, the AP reports. (The National Park Service recently said it didn't object to changing the name.)

Story: – Despite her brother's best hopes, a woman's body discovered at the back of an Airbnb property in Costa Rica has been identified as Florida's Carla Stefaniak, whom a security guard is now suspected of killing. Nicaraguan Bismarck Espinosa Martinez, a 32-year-old security guard who'd been staying in the apartment next-door to Stefaniak, was arrested after making conflicting statements to police, report the BBC and CNN. Early reports suggested a security guard had seen Stefaniak leave the Airbnb in a car around 5am on Nov. 28, her 36th birthday, though that now seems unlikely. Investigators say suspected blood was found inside the Airbnb, while Stefaniak's body—showing neck lacerations and blunt force trauma to the head, per the AP—was partially buried some 200 feet away. "Carla's father confirmed that the body belongs to Carla," reads a post on a Facebook group set up to help find Stefaniak, noting family members "will release critical digital leads of the investigation" and "continue asking questions about the involvement of others in Carla’s murder" in the coming days. Stefaniak had arrived in Costa Rica on Nov. 22 with her sister-in-law, who returned to the US on Nov. 27, a day before Stefaniak was to fly home to Miami. She seemingly vanished after complaining about a power outage at the "sketchy" Airbnb in San Jose's San Antonio de Escazu neighborhood. Officials say Martinez was detained after surveillance video from the apartment conflicted with his statements. Considered a flight risk, he's being held in jail, per CNN. (Another US tourist was murdered in Mexico.)

Story: – One line in a court order has revealed what PennLive calls a "bombshell" in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal. Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas Judge Gary S. Glazer wrote than an insurer—involved in a dispute over whether it should cover the $60 million in settlements Penn State has paid to 26 men who said they were abused by Sandusky, per NBC News—claims that "in 1976, a child allegedly reported to PSU's Head Coach Joseph Paterno that he [the child] was sexually molested by Sandusky." The detail comes from a deposition, ostensibly with that victim, taken as part of the insurance case. If the allegation about Paterno is true, it would mean he knew about Sandusky's crimes 22 years earlier than stated in special investigator reports, which alleged that Paterno knew in 1998. Before his death, Paterno said he became aware of allegations in 2001. "An allegation now about an alleged event 40 years ago, as represented by a single line in a court document regarding an insurance issue, with no corroborating evidence, does not change the facts. Joe Paterno did not, at any time, cover up conduct by Jerry Sandusky," the Paterno family's lawyer says. Sports Illustrated outlines four reasons why "it will likely never be known if the allegation against Paterno is true, false or somewhere in between."

How does the text suggest that Paterno's knowledge of Sandusky's crimes may have evolved over time, and what does this reveal about the culture and dynamics of Penn State University at the time?7.

Story: – No one disputed Jonathon Nicola was a big kid: The 11th-grader at Catholic Central High School in Windsor, Canada, stood 6 feet 9 inches, weighed 202 pounds, and wore a size 16 shoe, the Windsor Star reports. And no one initially disputed the Sudanese immigrant's age of 17—until apparently this week, when the basketball star was found to probably be a 30-year-old man and arrested for allegedly violating the country's Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Nicola, who had his first detention review Tuesday in front of the country's immigration board and will have another next week, was believed to have arrived in Canada from Sudan in November, on the day he then said was three days before his 17th birthday; he claimed to be searching for a better life. "I don't know how many of [my friends] have a clue of how it is in Africa," he had told the Star back in January. But during his five-month stint on the school's basketball team, his size raised eyebrows. "I did think he looked older than a high-schooler," another student who played against Nicola in a December tournament tells the New York Daily News. "Basketball skill-wise he was all right, but his height is what made him better than everyone." Nicola's coach, whom he lives with, said in the January Star article that "I think this kid will have a chance at the NBA. I have never said that about any kid from Windsor." The school is remaining tight-lipped about Nicola specifically, with a spokesman telling the Star that there's "really not a whole lot to say" while the probe is ongoing and insisting there's a "system of checks and balances" the school relies on for incoming international students to make sure all paperwork is on the up-and-up. (The last time something like this happened, the imposter was Ukrainian.)

Story: – It appears that at least some of the 10 missing sailors from the USS John S. McCain never made it off the ship. Divers searching compartments of the damaged Navy destroyer have located human remains and were working to retrieve them, reports CBS News. Navy officials also said that a Malaysian search team had located an unidentified body elsewhere, reports the AP. The Navy vessel collided with an oil tanker off the coast of Singapore on Monday in one of the most congested shipping lanes in the world, the latest in a string of Navy accidents that has prompted an "operational pause" to assess safety. China, meanwhile, is using the latest accident to criticize the US naval presence in the region. The US "is becoming a dangerous obstacle in Asian waters," declared the official China Daily newspaper. "The US Navy, which likes to claim its presence can help safeguard 'freedom of navigation' in the South China Sea, is proving to be an increasing hindrance to ships sailing in Asian waters," said the editorial. The USS McCain had been returning from a patrol in the South China Sea, during which it sailed close to one of China's controversial man-made islands, when the collision occurred. The cause remains under investigation.

Story: – Greenhouse gas emissions rose by a record amount in 2010, leading to the worst-ever carbon output in history, according to unpublished International Energy Agency estimates. The record rise—which, contrary to some predictions, even the recession couldn’t curb—means that hopes of keeping global warming to a safe level is nearly out of reach, the Guardian reports in an exclusive. The paper had previously reported that in order to prevent potentially “dangerous climate change,” we must keep the global average temperature from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius. But the IEA's chief economist now says that idea is just “a nice Utopia.” The IEA estimates that 30.6 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide entered the atmosphere last year, most of it from burning fossil fuel. That’s a rise of 1.6 gigatonnes over 2009's figure. "I am very worried. This is the worst news on emissions," says the economist for the IEA, which has calculated that annual emissions must remain below 32 gigatonnes annually through 2020 if we're to escape global warming's worst effects. Another expert warns that if the pattern continues, there will be “a 50% chance of a rise in global average temperature of more than 4C by 2100,” which would lead to “widespread mass migration and conflict.” Click to see the latest power duo to fight climate change.

Story: – A rural school district in Pennsylvania that has armed teachers and students with rocks to ward off potential school shooters has arranged for armed security, reports the AP. Blue Mountain School District Superintendent David Helsel said in a statement posted on the district's website that "Starting tomorrow and into the near future, we have arranged for additional armed security for our buildings." Helsel says media attention over the district's planned response to school shooters "has increased our concern regarding the possibility that something may happen." Last week, Helsel said every classroom in the district about 90 miles northwest of Philadelphia has a 5-gallon bucket of river stones. He said the rocks are one small part of the district's overall security plan. The Allentown Morning Call quotes this from the school's policy: "Students and teachers in locked down classrooms are to put up physical barricades. If the intruder gets past these barricades, all students are to Counter their entry by throwing items at the intruder to inflict as much damage as possible and protect themselves. When will the river stones actually be used? This is a last resort! Throwing river stones or other items will only be used if all other steps have been taken to avoid contact with an intruder."

Story: – In 2014, a New Jersey couple bought their dream home in Westfield, in what's ended up being one of the more headline-grabbing real estate purchases America has seen in recent years. That's all thanks to "the Watcher," an anonymous sender of creepy and ominous letters to the new residents of 657 Boulevard. Except "residents" is a misnomer: Derek and Maria Broaddus and their three kids never actually moved in, having been so spooked by the contents of the letters, the first of which arrived as they were having renovations done. In a lengthy piece for the Cut, Reeves Wiedeman shares extensive excerpts from the letters, like this: "Will the young blood play in the basement? Or are they too afraid to go down there alone. I would [be] very afraid if I were them. It is far away from the rest of the house. If you were upstairs you would never hear them scream." Wiedeman traces in great detail the ultimately fruitless hunt to unmask the Watcher: recounting clues (one letter referenced an easel on a porch that could only be seen from the backyard or next door); the neighbors the family suspected; the former FBI agents, security firm, and forensic linguist they hired to analyze the letters and their handwriting; and the one small bit of DNA evidence they had. The story simultaneously tracks their quest to get out from under the burden of their purchase, which they were unable to sell; an attempt to raze the home and divide the lot into two smaller ones was prohibited by the town's planning board after an outcry from residents. Some suspected a scam, lawsuits went nowhere, and the renter they finally found received, you guessed it, a letter from the Watcher. Derek's belief: "In my view, [the sender lives in] one of ten houses in the world." Read the full story here. (Or read more longform stories here.)

Cristie Schoen Codd, 38, and Joseph Codd, 45, were reported missing by family members Sunday, according to the Hollywood Reporter; deputies found their pets and their vehicles still at their North Carolina home. Fellow North Carolinian Robert Jason Owens, 36, was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder and a count of murder of an unborn child, plus charges related to breaking or entering and stealing a laptop, jewelry, and a gun. Authorities believe the Codds died on Thursday, but won't comment on the couple's remains. Owens was a contractor the Codds hired to work on their home.

Story: – A story out of a remote mining town in Nicaragua whose details are still being confirmed now has a clear and tragic outcome: The mother of two young children is dead, having suffered burns across 80% of her body. The Washington Post reports on the pieces being put together. It seems as though Vilma Trujillo Garcia, a 25-year-old woman, may have been suffering from a mental health crisis a couple weeks ago and possibly threatened people with a machete. Afterward, a pastor arrived at her house and took her to his church to conduct a healing. He allegedly kept her in the church for a week, and tells police: "God has made me a revelation ... that a group of brothers should take the sick woman and tie her up near the fire ... so that the demon will leave the body of the sick and go into the fire." And so it went. Nicaraguan police say the mother was stripped naked, bound, and thrown into the fire. Nine hours later, her teen sister found her in a ravine, and she was taken to a hospital in the capital city of Managua, where she died Tuesday. Evangelical pastor Juan Gregorio Rocha Romero and four others have now been arrested, reports the AP. Rocha Romero counters that Trujillo Garcia "suspended herself and fell in" as the demon left her body; Jezebel picks up a Spanish-language interview with an advocate for the family who says the woman was battling "mental health problems." Trujillo Garcia's husband says his wife wasn't demonized, and that "what they did to her was witchcraft." Nicaraguan VP Rosario Murillo has called the death "a backward situation," while the Assemblies of God church has distanced itself from the pastor. (This exorcist told of a woman vomiting pins.)

Story: – The IRS is defending itself against the Inspector General's report on its targeting of Tea Party groups, saying they made up only a "minority" of the 471 political nonprofit groups scrutinized. And, hey, three—three!—of those 471 were Democrat-leaning groups, including one, Emerge America, that was actually denied tax-exempt status, Bloomberg reports. "[It is] important to understand that the group of centralized cases included organizations of all political views," the IRS said in a statement. It also said that although "Inappropriate shortcuts" were used to identify some of the groups, most of them would have still been singled out for extra scrutiny had the agency gone about it correctly, reports ABC. The other two more liberal groups on the list that received the extra examination seem largely positive about the experience. "I'm not saying it was fun but it was important," said a spokesperson from Progress Texas. But in a letter to the IRS, Republican lawmakers Darrell Issa and Jim Jordan claim the extra scrutiny put the Tea Party groups and others "in a state of purgatory where they often languished without action for periods as long as two years," Fox News reports. "The actions of the IRS are unconscionable and appalling," they wrote.

Story: – Why do women swoon over handsome men like Brad Pitt? Not merely for their rippling muscles or striking faces, but because of their robust immune systems, according to a new study. Men who appear seductively macho have higher testosterone, and the study found a correlation between testosterone levels and a strong immune system, explains LiveScience. Researchers in the UK assembled 74 Latvian men in their early 20s and gave them a vaccine that triggers the production of antibodies. They then provided the men's photographs to Latvian women, who rated them for attractiveness. The results showed that the men with the most testosterone displayed both the strongest immune response and garnered the highest ratings of sexual appeal. "It's probably only a matter of time before we're eagerly awaiting the release of People's Sexiest Immune System Alive issue," adds Cassie Murdoch of Jezebel.

Story: – At least half of all cases of Alzheimer's disease are linked to common risk factors, and researchers believe the number of cases could be sharply reduced if people took steps to tackle those underlying issues. To reduce the risk, researchers say people need to stay active both mentally and physically, quit smoking, and improve their diets, the Globe and Mail reports. The biggest risk factor is having a low level of education, which researchers say is linked to almost a fifth of cases worldwide. "We are assuming that when you change the risk factor, then you change the risk,” the lead researcher noted. "What we need to do now is figure out whether that assumption is correct." The president of the Alzheimer's Association hailed the research as "another brick in the wall suggesting that Alzheimer's doesn't have to be a passive thing that we wait to come get us"—but he stressed that many of the causes are still unknown. "A lot of people are going to do everything right, and they'll still get Alzheimer's disease. We have to be careful not to blame the victim," he told the San Jose Mercury-News.

Story: – Add one more name to the list of people standing firmly in Josh Duggar's corner. Michael Seewald, father-in-law of Josh's sister, Jessa, has posted a long blog entry explaining why "the Seewald family stands with the Duggar family in solidarity," Page Six reports. "Josh, hang in there," he writes. "Let this trial in your life build humility and grace. Don’t be angry at the world for their hatred of you. ... I’m rooting for you." Though Seewald acknowledges Josh's actions were sinful, he notes that now "there is blood in the water and the sharks are in a feeding frenzy"—the sharks being those who oppose the Duggars and all they stand for. The family, Seewald explains, did all they were required to do when the incident occurred, and there's no reason now to "[dredge] up past sins that have been painfully grieved over once already by all involved." It was up to the authorities whether to take action against Josh, and they did not, Seewald writes. As for the reasons behind Josh's actions, Seewald eschews the idea that his parents' "repressed" his sexuality or "sheltered" him: "Fan the flames of youthful lust and you end up with what we have: unprecedented numbers of unwed mothers, millions of abortions, rampant STDs, and the unraveling of the fabric of our whole society. Josh didn’t sin because he was repressed, he sinned because like all of us he is a sinner," but he then "found forgiveness and cleansing from Jesus Christ." But Seewald notes that his sympathy is also with the victims, and urges any other victims of sexual abuse not to keep silent no matter who is doing the abusing: "No matter how much you love the abuser you must tell someone." Josh's other high-profile supporters include: Mike Huckabee, who noted the Duggars "dealt with" the problem and were "honest and open about it" at the time. A Texas pastor's wife who compared Josh's actions to kids "playing doctor." Popular Christian blogger Matt Walsh, who says progressives are the hypocrites in this situation because, among other things, they didn't get this upset about Lena Dunham and her sister.

Story: – The UN's Syria observer mission officially ended last night, and monitors were seen leaving today after their four months in the country failed to bring an end to the violence. The last monitors should be out by Friday, leaving just a small liaison office in Damascus, Reuters reports. But Turkey says the UN must create a "safe zone" for refugees inside Syria—almost 70,000 have fled to Turkey, and the country only has room for 100,000, its foreign minister says. Today is the second day of Eid al-Fitr, a major three-day Muslim holiday marking the end of Ramadan, but intense fighting in the country continues, the AP adds. Bashar al-Assad was yesterday seen for the first time since last month attending prayers to mark al-Eid's start; today his troops shelled Aleppo, Daraa, and a suburb of Damascus, leaving as many as 30 dead. Meanwhile, Jordan says rockets from Syria fell inside its borders, wounding a young girl yesterday; the government sent a letter of protest in response, AFP reports.

Story: – New York's attorney general has announced his resignation after four women accused the Democrat of physically abusing them. Eric Schneiderman released a statement late Monday saying the allegations will "effectively prevent him from leading the office's work" and he therefore will resign on the close of business on Tuesday, per the AP. Schneiderman says he strongly contests the allegations, which he calls unrelated to his professional conduct or operations of the office. Two of the women spoke on the record to the New Yorker. They say Schneiderman repeatedly hit them, often after drinking. A third woman who also was involved with him told her story to the other two women, but said she was too frightened to come forward. A fourth woman said Schneiderman slapped her when she rebuffed him but also asked to remain unidentified. The New Yorker said it vetted the third woman's allegations, and saw a photo of what the fourth woman said was her injury. The two women who spoke on the record, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, both said the physical abuse escalated over time, including choking and hitting, and that Schneiderman also was a heavy drinker.

Story: – Things seems to be looking up for ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. He made his first public appearance in about a year today and looked noticeably healthier, maybe even a little cocky, according to several media accounts. Mubarak showed up for the start of his retrial on charges that he ordered the killing of protesters near the end of his rein, but legal proceedings crashed to a halt after only a few minutes when the judge recused himself and referred the case to another court. Observers seem split on whether the delay is good or bad news for Mubarak, but descriptions of the former president were universally positive: Guardian: "He appeared in much better health than in his last (appearance). He arrived in court wearing sunglasses, smiled and waved at onlookers, and seemed relaxed—perhaps hopeful that Saturday's proceedings would secure his release." New York Times: "He waved to the courtroom several times with the signature turn of the wrist he used as an all-powerful autocrat addressing his people. Though his lips were pursed, he turned up the corners of his mouth several times in an unmistakable smile. No longer stone-faced and sullen, he chatted with his sons, or sat with his fingers pressed together in front of his chin as though he were listening in concentration from behind a desk in his office." Reuters: "Propped up on a gurney in a cage with the other defendants, he looked fitter and more relaxed than on previous appearances in the dock, holding animated conversations with his son Gamal, and occasionally smiling and waving to people in the courtroom. " Associated Press: "In earlier court appearances, Mubarak's two sons would often stand to shield their father from the cameras, but at the start of the new trial Mubarak appeared to be grinning at times as he waved to his supporters. His wave seemed to suggest a nod to increasing nostalgia among some Egyptians for his rule, when tourism and other vital economic pillars fared better."

Story: – A study is linking new cases of Parkinson's to depression and anxiety—shortly after it emerged that Robin Williams was in the early stages of the disease. In a look at 423 patients who'd recently been diagnosed, researchers found that the incidence of depression and anxiety was twice as high among those who'd recently been diagnosed versus the wider population, the BBC reports. Some 14% of patients had depression at the beginning of the study; in healthy subjects, the figure was just 6.6%. The number of patients with depression increased slightly over the course of the two-year study, while it decreased a bit among the non-Parkinson's population. A researcher points to both psychological and physical reasons for depression in Parkinson's patients, who, another expert notes, can suffer from depression and anxiety a decade before Parkinson's develops. One issue, a neurology professor told NBC last week, is that the public perception of the illness is "far more grim and dire than reality": "The majority of people with Parkinson’s are walking around without telling anyone. You only see the small fraction who are not doing well."
Summary: 1. What was the sample size of the study, and how did the researchers define "recently diagnosed" Parkinson's patients?2. How did the researchers account for potential confounding variables, such as age, gender, and other underlying health conditions, that could influence the incidence of depression and anxiety in Parkinson's patients?3. What was the timeframe of the study, and how did the researchers measure the incidence of depression and anxiety at the beginning and end of the study?4. How did the researchers determine whether the increase in depression and anxiety among Parkinson's patients was statistically significant, and what was the magnitude of the increase?5. What was the average age of the patients in the study, and how did their age affect the incidence of depression and anxiety?6. How did the researchers account for the fact that some patients may have been experiencing depression and anxiety before their Parkinson's diagnosis?7. What was the response rate among patients in the study, and how did the researchers ensure that patients were accurately diagnosed with Parkinson's?8. How did the researchers define "mild" and "severe" depression and anxiety in the study, and how did they determine which patients fell into each category?9. What was the relationship between the severity of Parkinson's symptoms and the incidence of depression and anxiety among patients?10. How did the researchers account for the fact that some patients may have been taking antidepressant or anxiolytic medications, which could have influenced their results?11. What are some potential mechanisms by which Parkinson's disease could lead to depression and anxiety, according to the researcher quoted in the article?12. How does the study's finding of a higher incidence of depression and anxiety among Parkinson's patients compared to the general population align with other research on the topic?13. What are some potential implications of the study's findings for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease, and how could they be incorporated into clinical practice?14. How could the study's findings be used to improve public awareness and understanding of Parkinson's disease, and how could they help to reduce stigma surrounding the condition?15. What are some potential areas for future research on the relationship between Parkinson's disease and depression and anxiety, and how could these studies help to advance our understanding of this complex issue?
Story: – President Trump is planning to deliver on a key campaign promise Tuesday with an executive order tightening up "Buy American" and "Hire American" rules, White House officials say. A senior official told reporters Monday that the Buy American part of the order, which Trump plans to sign at the Snap-on Inc. toolmaker's headquarters in Wisconsin, will maximize "Made in America" content in government procurement policies and get rid of waivers, free-trade agreement exemptions, and other loopholes "to stop the foreign cheaters from using taxpayer funds to steal our jobs, to shutter our steel mills and offshore our factories," Politico reports. As for "Hire American," officials say Trump plans to make good on his promise to stop the H-1B visa program being used as a "cheap labor program," Reuters reports. The order will call on the departments of Homeland Security, Labor, Justice, and State to find ways to reform the program, which critics say is being abused by outsourcing firms that specialize in finding cheaper replacements for American workers. Tech companies say they want reforms to the program to be carried out carefully, so that it returns to its intended purpose of awarding visas to the highest-skilled and highest-paid workers, reports the Washington Post.

Story: – Star Wars: The Force Awakens is continuing to cut through box-office records like a light saber through butter and is now North America's highest-grossing movie ever. Disney says that on Wednesday afternoon, just 20 days after its release, the movie passed the $760.5 million record set by Avatar, which overtook Titanic's record in 2010, the Wall Street Journal reports. The next record to beat will be Avatar's $2.78 billion global gross, the Journal notes. The Force Awakens currently has a global gross of around $1.6 billion—and it hasn't opened in China yet. The Force Awakens has taken in more dollars than any film in American history, but the story is different when inflation is taken into account, NBC News reports. Adjusting for inflation, Gone With the Wind—released in 1939, when movie tickets cost less than a quarter—is still the highest-grossing movie, with a total take of $1.7 billion. The first Star Wars movie is in second place on the inflation-adjusted chart with a lifetime gross of $1.5 billion. The Force Awakens hasn't cracked the top 20 in that chart yet, though it's rapidly closing in on Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is No. 20, the Journal notes. (The movie has also been playing in space.)

Story: – After 15 years and 33 seasons, The Bachelor franchise has finally cast its first African-American lead. Rachel Lindsay, one of four women left competing for Nick Viall's heart on the current season of The Bachelor, will kick off her own search for love as The Bachelorette on ABC on May 22, reports USA Today. Lindsay, a 31-year-old lawyer from Texas—who also received the "first impression" rose from Viall on the first episode of this season, per the Hollywood Reporter—appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday to help make the announcement, which, in a rare move, came weeks before the season finale of The Bachelor. Show creator Mike Fleiss had promised a "historic" announcement following years of controversy over the show's lack of diversity. Last summer, ABC Entertainment chief Channing Dungey said she hoped to "increase the pool of diverse candidates in the beginning" since a favorite contestant from one season usually ends up as the next Bachelor or Bachelorette. ABC boss Robert Mills says Lindsay is "the fans' choice" and "an accomplished, confident and beautiful woman who knows what she wants in life." On Kimmel, Lindsay said she's looking for a man with a great smile who can make her laugh. "I'm ready to find love, to find a husband," she said. (See how Viall feels about saying goodbye to Lindsay.)

Story: – Phyllis Schlafly's advice to young men: Don't date feminists, even though "some of them are pretty." Speaking to an all-male student crowd at The Citadel college in South Carolina this week, the so-called "godmother of conservatism" also blamed feminists for drumming up the recent contraception flap in US politics, The Post and Courier reports. "Contraception is not controversial," said the 87-year-old. "The issue is not access. It’s who’s going to pay for it.” "Feminist is a bad word and everything they stand for is bad," she went on. "Find out if your girlfriend is a feminist before you get too far into it. Some of them are pretty. They don’t all look like Bella Abzug.” Schlafly made waves in the 1970s, when her small group spearheaded a successful charge to stop states from ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment. Now, she says, young conservatives must do the same: “It’s important to look at what might happen in 100 years." Hat tip to RawStory for the link.

Story: – President Trump on Tuesday accused Google of suppressing conservative views in search results, and the tech giant has responded. It's just not so, says a company statement sent to Business Insider. "Search is not used to set a political agenda and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology," says the statement, which adds that Google is constantly tweaking its algorithms in order to return "high-quality content" when its users search. "We never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment." Related coverage: What now? Asked whether the White House feels that some kind of regulation is necessary for Google, economic adviser Larry Kudlow didn't rule out the possibility. "We'll let you know. We're taking a look at it," he told reporters, per Politico. The source: As previously noted, Trump's accusatory tweets echoed a post at the conservative PJ Media blog. Read it here. The site conducted its own unscientific experiment and concluded that 96% of results for "Trump" news come from "left-leaning and anti-Trump media outlets." Examples of those sites were CBS News, USA Today, Politico, and CNN. It said right-leaning sites were poorly represented, including the National Review, the Weekly Standard, and Breitbart. Exceptions it cited include Fox News and the Wall Street Journal.

Story: – The LAPD is about to embark on a yearlong test program with a fleet of "small Unmanned Aerial Systems," aka drones—making it the country's largest police department to use them—and some residents aren't happy about it. The Los Angeles Times reports on Tuesday's 3-1 vote by a civilian oversight committee LA Police Commission has been greeted with profanity, chants of "shame on you," and a small demonstration outside LAPD headquarters. Those pushing for the drone test say the camera-carrying devices could keep cops safer by helping gather information from the skies during dangerous situations. "Whether it's an active shooter at a school, or a suspect barricaded in a home … this technology will help us save lives," the president of the LAPD's union says in a statement. But critics, including the ACLU of California, fear the drones could be used for other reasons, or even be used as weapons. A National Lawyers Guild Los Angeles rep says those opposed are afraid of "mission creep," per the Times. "The history of this department is of starting off with supposedly good intentions about the new toys that it gets … only to then get too tempted by what they can do with those toys," he says. The LAPD insists the drones will be strictly regulated: Ars Technica cites the guidelines that spell out "permissible uses" (e.g., "barricaded suspects" and "natural disasters"), as well as prohibited ones (any that are "in violation of the law or Constitution"). The drones also can't be weaponized, and each flight must get the OK from a "high-ranking officer." LAPD Chief Charlie Beck says there will likely be one in-service drone and one for backup; they'll start their mission in 30 days or so.

Story: – An unfortunate family feud that's playing out amid Nelson Mandela's final days has now turned into a legal one—involving charges of grave tampering, no less, reports the BBC. It all revolves around where Mandela will be buried. Grandson Mandla thinks it should be in the village of Mvezo, where he just happens to be chief and where his famous grandfather was born. But other family members think it should be in the nearby village of Qunu, where Mandela was actually raised and where Mandela himself has publicly stated he would like to be buried, reports ABC News. Just how serious is Mandla? He up and moved the bodies of three of Mandela's children from the family plot in Qunu to Mvezo in 2011, without asking the rest of the family's permission. He envisions turning Mvezo into a tourist destination, and his critics say he's just trying to cash in on his grandfather's legacy. Now 16 members of Mandela's family have lodged a complaint of grave tampering against Mandla, and police are investigating. In a separate legal action, he is fighting a judge's order to return the three bodies to Qunu.

Story: – Students at Youngstown State University in Ohio woke up Monday to find pro-ISIS messages painted on a campus rock, WPXI reports. Photos of the three screeds soon made it online: "France deserves destruction," "YSU supports ISIS," and "We are coming for you." Students quickly spray-painted the rock white and covered it with patriotic and peace-related messages, but the impact was still felt on campus. "It definitely sent, like, a terror around, and then there was a shooting threat last week, so it's just like one after the other," says student David Ottney. Another student tweeted, "Whoever did this to the rock needs [to be] expelled. ISIS is not some joke. Terrorism is not a joke." Mohamed Mishmish, an international student, talked about his writing of a peace message on the rock: "I came here today to write 'peace' in Arabic to show that if there should be anything defaced in Arabic on this rock, it should be peace-condoning and not in the name of terrorism," he says. According to the school's Facebook Page, police are investigating, the FBI has been contacted, and "there is no credible threat to the campus at this time." Classes were still in session today, reports WFMJ. The rock has been used for decades as a place to write messages about campus organizations and events.

Story: – If you've ever been unable to find a bathroom in a moment of need, you know the gotta-go feeling. That's nothing compared to the wood frog, which doesn't urinate all winter; in Alaska, that's eight months without peeing, reports the AP. Scientists have figured out how they do it, or rather how they survive without doing it. Recycling urea—the main waste in urine—into useful nitrogen keeps the frogs alive as they hibernate and freeze. Urea protects cells and tissues, even as the critters' hearts, brains, and bloodstreams stop. The frogs can do it because special microbes in their guts recycle the urea, according to a study in Tuesday's Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Some call the frog pee a type of antifreeze, but study co-author Jon Costanzo, a Miami University zoologist, bristles at that. "Their eyes are white. Their skin is frosty. They're like little rocks. They're frozen," Costanzo says. Costanzo's team captured wood frogs during active times, then turned them into frog-sicles under controlled conditions. Costanzo and colleagues looked at the bacteria that live in frog guts. One type of bacteria, Pseudomonas, soars in the winter but can't be seen in active frogs. If the frogs were human, they would be called dead, Costanzo notes; some Alaskan wood frogs get as cold as zero degrees. But once the temperatures warm, they come back to life. Other animals don't urinate when they hibernate, but mammals don't do the big freeze quite like wood frogs, which wake up in still-cold February to mate. "This is stress that would definitely kill any mammal," Costanzo says. "People are fascinated by bear hibernation, but in my book any animal that allows itself to freeze solid and is able to ... go about its business like nothing happened, to me that's about as cool as it gets."
Summary: 1. What is the main idea of the article, and how do the wood frogs manage to survive without urinating for eight months?2. How do the special microbes in the frogs' guts help them recycle urea and survive during hibernation?3. What is the significance of the fact that the frogs' eyes and skin turn white and frosty during hibernation?4. How do the bacteria in the frogs' guts change during hibernation, and what role do they play in the frogs' survival?5. How do the wood frogs' ability to survive without urinating for extended periods of time compare to other animals that hibernate, and what are the implications of this ability for their survival?6. What is the significance of the fact that the frogs wake up in still-cold February to mate, and how does this relate to their ability to survive hibernation?7. How do the wood frogs' unique physiological adaptations make them "cooler" than other animals that hibernate, according to the author?8. What are the potential applications of the wood frogs' ability to recycle urea and survive hibernation for human health and medicine?9. How does the study of the wood frogs' hibernation habits contribute to our understanding of the complex relationships between animals and their environments?10. What are some potential ethical considerations or implications of studying and manipulating the physiological adaptations of animals like the wood frogs for human benefit?
Story: – The Mediterranean region has been grappling with a huge influx of migrants traveling from the Libyan coast to Europe, and the effects have been devastating: So far, some 60,000 people have attempted the crossing this year, per the UN, and more than 1,800 have died, the BBC reports. That's 20 times the number who died during the same period last year, and the crisis has prompted the EU to propose a distribution system involving refugee quotas for its 28 member countries. Those quotas would be based on factors like the country's existing population and unemployment levels, the New York Times reports. Countries like Germany, Italy, and Malta that have seen large numbers of migrants arrive or apply for asylum favor balancing the numbers, the BBC notes. It's "a question of fairness," says Austria's chancellor, noting that asylum is "not an act of mercy but a human right." But the UK, Hungary, Slovakia, and Estonia are poised to fight the idea. "The idea that somebody allows some refugees in their own country and then distributes them to other member states is mad and unfair," Hungary's prime minister said on state radio, per the Times. The news comes as Amnesty International highlights the dangers of life in Libya for migrants, saying they're abused by those who smuggle them and face "abduction, torture, and rape," the BBC notes. One Syrian family describes the decision to cross the sea: "We were facing death in Libya, so we thought we might as well face death in trying to get to Italy."
Summary: 1. What are the main reasons why migrants are traveling from the Libyan coast to Europe, according to the text?2. How many migrants have attempted the crossing this year, according to the UN, and how many have died, according to the BBC?3. What is the EU proposing to address the crisis, and how would the proposed distribution system work?4.

What is the position of the UK, Hungary, Slovakia, and Estonia on the proposed distribution system, and why?6. What are the dangers of life in Libya for migrants, according to Amnesty International, and how does this affect their decision to attempt the crossing?7. How does the decision to cross the sea reflect the desperation and vulnerability of the migrants, according to the Syrian family quoted in the text?8. How does the crisis in the Mediterranean region highlight the need for a more comprehensive and humane approach to refugee and migration policies, in your opinion?9. What are the potential long-term consequences of the current situation for the migrants, the EU, and global human rights standards?10.

Story: – Nearly 80% of people who've injured themselves while sleepwalking felt no pain and didn't even wake up, according to a new study published this month in Sleep. And we're not talking about a stubbed toe or bumped elbow, either. One study subject jumped out a third-floor window—suffering multiple severe fractures—and didn't feel any pain until waking up later, according to an American Academy of Sleep Medicine press release. It was the same for another person who fell off his roof and broke his leg while sleepwalking. Of the 100 sleepwalkers studied by a French research team, 47 reported injuring themselves while sleepwalking at least once. But only 10 actually woke up immediately from the pain. The study's lead researcher, Dr. Regis Lopez, says those numbers are surprising, according to the AASM press release. “Our results may help to understand the mechanisms of the sleepwalking episodes,” Lopez says. “We hypothesize that a dissociate state of arousal may modify the components of sleep-wake behavior, consciousness, and also pain perception.” As the International Business Times simplifies: Researchers believe there's some sort of connection between sleepwalking and the neurons that send pain signals to the spinal cord and brain. The study also found sleepwalkers are nearly four times more likely to report a history of headaches and 10 times more likely to report suffering from migraines while awake. (See what the chance you've sleepwalked before is.)
Summary: 1. Can you elaborate on the definition of "severe fractures" and how they were determined in the study?2. How did the researchers determine that the participants were sleepwalking during the episodes of injury, rather than simply experiencing a vivid dream or nightmare?3. How did the study subjects report feeling pain after waking up from their sleepwalking episodes, and were there any differences in their accounts of pain experience?4. What were the demographic characteristics of the study participants, such as age, gender, and any underlying medical conditions, that may have influenced their likelihood of sleepwalking or experiencing pain?5. How did the researchers account for potential confounding variables, such as sleep deprivation or alcohol consumption, that may have affected the study results?6. Can you provide more information on the "dissociate state of arousal" that the researcher hypothesizes may be involved in sleepwalking and pain perception?7. How does the study's finding of a higher incidence of headaches and migraines among sleepwalkers compare to previous research on this topic, and what might this suggest about the underlying mechanisms of sleepwalking?8. What are the potential implications of these findings for the diagnosis and treatment of sleepwalking and related conditions, such as migraines and headaches?9. How might these results inform our understanding of the neural mechanisms involved in pain perception and regulation during sleep and wakefulness?10. Are there any potential limitations or criticisms of the study that could affect its conclusions or recommendations for future research?
Story: – Don't have a lot of vacation days stockpiled but need to get away? Consider taking a "workcation"—what the Wall Street Journal describes as a growing trend in which workers head to a destination and pay for their own travel and lodgings, but don't get docked vacation days because they're actually doing work while sprawled on the beach or holed up in a remote mountain cabin. An employer may agree to an employee's workcation if she simply does some basic work tasks (e.g., checking email, calling in for conference calls) from the road. Or, if that's not enough, the employee could still put in regular workdays, then venture off to check out her destination in her off-hours. Besides, the Journal notes, many American workers already feel compelled to check in with the office while on vacation, so why not make it official? But it turns out while it may work for some (said PTO-strapped employees), some fear this alternative could come back to bite everyone in the sunburned bum. First, it won't be a viable option for every worker (think salesmen who need to be in a specific territory to work). Plus, there may be time zone differences to contend with, one worker pointed out to CBS Miami after recently traveling the world with her portable workstation. And by perpetuating our constant need to check in, it may condition us to never fully log off from work, leading to burnout. "It's not a good thing for employees who are vacationing to feel like they are always on an electronic leash," the president of a time-off advocacy group tells the paper. (See if you're in one of the five best—or worst—US cities for a summer staycation.)
Summary: 1. What is the main idea of the article, and how does it relate to the current work culture and trends?2. How does the concept of "workcations" differ from traditional vacations, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of each?3. What are some potential challenges or drawbacks of implementing workcations in the workplace, according to the article?4. How might workcations impact employee burnout and work-life balance, and what are some strategies that employees and employers can use to mitigate these effects?5. What are some potential implications of workcations on the overall productivity and efficiency of employees, and how might they affect the organization as a whole?6. How might workcations impact the way employees view their vacation time and the importance of taking breaks from work?7. What are some potential solutions or alternatives to workcations that employees and employers could consider, especially for those who are unable to take a traditional vacation or who have demanding work requirements?8. How might workcations impact the way we think about work and vacation in the future, and what are some potential changes that we might see in the workplace culture and policies?9. What are some potential ethical considerations or concerns related to workcations, such as the potential for employees to feel like they are always "on call" or the impact on the organization's productivity and efficiency?10. How might workcations be implemented in a way that benefits both employees and employers, and what are some potential best practices or guidelines that could be established to ensure a successful workcation experience?

Story: – Robert Mueller's team is interested in President Trump's attacks last summer on Jeff Sessions—whom Trump reportedly likens to an elderly, bumbling cartoon character—and his team has been questioning people to that end, sources tell the Washington Post. Mueller is probing whether Trump tried to obstruct justice as part of the special counsel's investigation into links between Trump's campaign and Russia, and the investigation has already found that Trump pressured Sessions not to recuse himself from the Justice Department's Russia investigation in March 2017, per the New York Times. People familiar with the matter say Mueller aims to learn whether comments Trump made about Sessions in late July and early August were part of an effort to force him out and install a replacement who would intervene in the investigation. Trump publicly described a "beleaguered" Sessions as having a "VERY weak position on Hillary Clinton crimes" in July; the Post claims Trump privately refers to him as Mr. Magoo and complained his attorney general wasn't as loyal as he should be. One White House adviser describes Trump as "stunned" that his harsh comments didn't spur Sessions' resignation. But Sessions has dug his heels in, and apparently famously so: The paper reports aides marked the anniversary of his confirmation by gifting him a personalized bulletproof vest. Trump has continued to attack Sessions: A week ago, he appeared to blame Sessions for a lack of an investigation into Democrats' "crimes." On Wednesday, he attacked Sessions again. New York offers a history of their feud.

Story: – Remains found in an ancient tomb at Vergina nearly 40 years ago belong to none other than Alexander the Great's father, Greek researchers say. Their evidence: The bones and cremated remains show signs of violence that jibe with the life of Macedonian King Philip II, a warrior who lost an eye to an arrow at the siege of Methone in 354BC, Discovery reports via Mashable. Presented by head researcher Theodore Antikas, the analysis includes X-ray images, electron-microscopic scans, and some 3,000 color photographs of the remains. Antikas says the remains show signs of a sinus infection "that might have been caused by an old facial trauma" (the eye wound), along with a sharp wound to the left hand (likely a battle scar) and degenerative markers and lesions that indicate a horse-rider in his middle years. What's more, the female remains buried alongside him apparently belong to a warrior woman whose body matches armor found in the tomb, meaning she likely used weaponry found there, too. What's the big deal? The weapons were forged by Scythians—a group of ancient Iranian tribes—and "no Macedonian king other than Philip is known to have had 'relations' with a Scythian," says Antikas. He adds that the woman may have been the daughter of Athea, the Scythian king. If Antikas' team is right, they will settle a debate that scholars have waged ever since the tomb was discovered by a Greek archaeologist in 1977-78. Meanwhile, archaeologists at a burial mound 100 miles away have found a large floor mosaic dating back to the time of Alexander the Great, depicting the god Hermes as he ushers souls to the afterlife, the AP reports. The remains of Alexander himself, however, are yet to be found. (Read about an ancient image of Jesus found in an Egyptian tomb.)

Story: – Israeli police investigators descended on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home Monday to continue a corruption probe, and while officials are being tight-lipped on what was discussed, a police spokesman revealed that questioning revolved around Netanyahu being "under caution on the suspicions of receiving benefits," CNN reports. The Jerusalem Post reports that Netanyahu was grilled for more than three hours at his Jerusalem residence, which had a black barrier erected at the gates to keep media from peeking in, and that further Q&A sessions are anticipated. Meanwhile, before the cops showed up at his door, Netanyahu asserted his innocence, warning his political enemies and the media to "hold off partying" and proclaiming that "nothing will happen, because there is nothing," per the BBC, which details other allegations against Netanyahu over the years. Israeli AG Avichai Mandelblit said later that Netanyahu, accused of accepting "improper gifts" from two businessmen, is now subject to a full criminal investigation into supposed ethics transgressions. Mandelblit says a new inquiry involving Netanyahu began in July, with this specific accusation being lobbed three months ago. The AG adds four allegations first broached over the summer, including those swirling around illegal 2009 election activity, have been dismissed. The Post notes rumors of a second "more serious" case against the PM that may involve attempted bribery. Israel's opposition pols are currently responding in a "fairly subdued" manner, the New York Times reports, with Zionist Union leader Isaac Herzog noting it's "a tough day for Israel" and "we are not expressing satisfaction at another's misfortune." (Netanyahu has been busily attacking John Kerry.)

Beginning in the northeast, the country will vote for its next leadership over the course of several weeks, with polls closing May 12, the New York Times reports. The vote count comes May 16. The current governing party, the Indian Congress Party, has been in power for 10 years. But right now, the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party appears set to win—if polls are correct—making this election potentially historic, the Times notes. The middle class, the Times observes, is getting fed up with poor services and corruption from the Congress Party. The run-up to the election has seen voters gathering on social media. The BBC notes that voters, many of whom are women, were lining up to vote before polls opened; turnout around noon, local time, was about 35%. "We need good people in government," said one voter. A number of other parties also have candidates in the mix; 272 MPs are required to form a government in the 543-member lower house of parliament, and a coalition could be necessary if no party snags a majority.

Story: – Someone was stealing money from lockers in the boys' locker room at New Smyrna Beach High School in Florida ... and it ended up being probably the last person you'd expect. By April 25, $950 had been stolen from nine students, so school officials used an ultraviolet theft-detection kit to coat $141 in cash with an invisible luminescent powder. Invisible, that is, until it's put under a blacklight. They put the money into a wallet along with a school ID and other items, and put the wallet in a locker ... and when some of the cash went missing Monday, deputies checked the hands of everyone who had access to the locker room to look for the powder. All of the students were cleared after having their hands checked under the UV light, so deputies checked the coaching staff, and found that assistant varsity football coach and PE teacher Rodney Barnes was allegedly to blame. (Officials went with the sting operation because they couldn't put cameras in the locker room, WFTV explains.) Barnes, 43, admitted to taking $170, but deputies think they can link him to more of the thefts, the Orlando Sentinel reports. He faces charges of grand theft and burglary ... and, not surprisingly, he has resigned from the high school.

Story: – The world was shocked by the August 2014 death of Robin Williams, but "middle-aged men in despair" may have taken his suicide especially hard, Reuters notes. For a study published Wednesday in Plos One, researchers sifted through CDC data from 1999 through 2015 and found that there was a "marked increase" in the number of suicides from right after Williams' death through the end of 2014, and that the monthly number of suicides continued to rise throughout 2015 as well. There were 18,690 suicides from August 2014 to December 2014, which the scientists say was a nearly 10% increase from the expected number based on data extrapolations. Among individuals ages 30 to 44, the spike was even greater during that period—about 13%—and there was a 32% increase in suicides by suffocation, which is how Williams died (he asphyxiated after hanging himself). The study admits it can't prove Williams' death was the direct cause of any "copycat" suicides—there may have been other contributing factors or misclassifications—but it says his death, and the accompanying media coverage, "might have provided the necessary stimulus for high-risk segments of the U.S. population … to move from suicidal ideation to attempt." The study notes suicides within the general population often spike after a celebrity suicide, but headlines on Williams were particularly prevalent, and social media (which wasn't a force when, say, Kurt Cobain died in 1994) may have exacerbated the exposure. The study says the effects of celebrity suicides are concerning enough that the World Health Organization has put out guidance for journalists on responsibly reporting high-profile deaths such as Williams'. (Williams' wife talks about his last 10 devastating months.)

Story: – Rick Santorum is winning nearly universal praise from conservatives on his debate performance last night, particularly for the way he went after Mitt Romney on the similarities between his health care overhaul and President Obama's. "We can't give this issue away in the election," said Santorum more than once. The GOP should take heed, writes Jeffrey H. Anderson in the Weekly Standard. It's clear Obama doesn't want to raise the volatile issue, so "if Republicans are going to have a mandate to repeal this unprecedented threat to liberty and fiscal solvency, they will have to bring it up—or, rather, their nominee will have to bring it up. And he will have to know why he opposes it—not merely that he does." At the National Review Online, Robert Costa says Santorum's push on that issue—"a stark reminder of Romney's vulnerability"—and his rising above the Romney-Gingrich street fight, proved he was "the adult in the room." Unfortunately for Santorum, "it's probably not enough to win Tuesday’s primary, but as Iowa fades in the rearview mirror, it was necessary."

Story: – Wanted: a "highly qualified executive" with "minimum eight years experience President of the United States or equivalent nation." If that sounds like a job for the recently unemployed Barack Obama, well, you're not seeing things. Cards Against Humanity posted an ad on Craigslist and in the Chicago Tribune seeking a CEO with a CV that includes a Nobel Peace Prize, UPI reports. The Chicago-based card-game maker known for pranks like digging a big hole for no reason, is looking for a leader who also boasts: "Strong public speaking skills" "Steady disposition, remains cool under pressure" "Experience hunting terrorist masterminds" "Strongly prefer the first black editor of Harvard Law Review" "The ideal candidate will be excited to travel for work," says the ad. "Women and minorities are strongly encouraged to apply." The lucky winner gets 51% of the company "and you can set your own salary." Other Obama-tailored perks include "unlimited almonds" and "health/dental/vision insurance (while available)." It's not the first time the ex-commander in chief has been prodded to get a job. Spotify founder Daniel Ek has already pitched "President of Playlists." Fortune thinks the latest job isn't likely to tempt the ex-president, who will have his hands full with the Obama Foundation to be housed in the future Obama Presidential Center.

Story: – There has been a steep rise in bison attacks on humans in Yellowstone National Park this year, which may be connected to a rise in visitors trying to take selfies or other close-up photos of the animals. The latest injured visitor—the fifth this year—is a 43-year-old woman from Mississippi who was charged by a bison Tuesday near the Fairy Falls trailhead just outside Old Faithful. She and her daughter turned their backs on the creature from roughly 6 yards away to get a photo with the bison in the background, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The National Park Service says the pair started to run when they heard the animal's footsteps, but it caught the woman and threw her in the air. The bison moved on after the woman's father came to her aid. Her family drove her to a clinic, where she was treated for minor injuries. "The family said they read the warnings in both the park literature and the signage, but saw other people close to the bison, so they thought it would be OK," a ranger tells CNN. "People need to recognize that Yellowstone wildlife is wild, even though they seem docile. This woman was lucky that her injuries were not more severe." The park, which tells visitors to stay at least 25 yards away from the animals, usually sees only one or two such incidents a year, and the rise in attacks could also be linked to a rise in visitor numbers, a spokeswoman tells the AP. Two of the other people attacked—a 62-year-old Australian visitor and a 16-year-old girl from Taiwan—were also trying to take bison photos. (In more positive selfie news, a plus-size woman's "fierce" selfie has gone viral.)

Story: – As the school year kicks off to a staggered start around the country, parents everywhere are bracing themselves for lengthy school-supply lists and soon-to-come homework battles—unless they have a child in Texas teacher Brandy Young's class. KTRK reports on the second-grade teacher's homework policy, which has gone viral since the teacher at Godley Elementary School distributed a copy at "Meet the Teacher" night and a parent posted it last week on Facebook. "Brooke is loving her new teacher already!" Samantha Gallagher raved about Young's edict on homework, which basically is that there won't be any, except for classroom work her students don't finish during regular school hours. "Research has been unable to prove that homework improves student performance," Young writes. Instead, she wants kids to take part in after-school activities "proven to correlate with student success." To wit: "Eat dinner as a family, read together, play outside, and get your child to bed early." Business Insider agrees with Young, noting that even though better test scores and knowledge retention have been linked to homework in some research, "there has never been any conclusive evidence ... that says homework gives kids a unique leg up in achievement." Young's message has struck a chord with parents worldwide—Gallagher's Facebook post has so far been shared more than 68,000 times. Young credits the school's superintendent for pushing teachers in her district to think outside the box, CBS News reports. "For any teacher considering anything that might benefit their students, I say go for it," she says. "If something doesn't work, change it." (A teacher's viral summer assignment included dancing.)

Story: – Off-road racing fans and promoters fear that the accident that killed eight people in the California desert Saturday night may end up killing their sport as well. The spectators were crushed when a driver lost control of his truck and skidded into a crowd just a few feet away, a tragedy that has turned a critical eye on a sport that has no enforced rules ... or guardrails, allowing viewers to get dangerously close to the 3,500-pound trucks as they lumber over jumps. Critics of the sport say the Bureau of Land of Management should never have issued a permit for the event to be held on its property, the Los Angeles Times reports, and environmental groups complain that the desert races destroy the ecosystem and that the federal government lacks the manpower to manage them. Race organizer Ron Matthews says the BLM has refused to tell him whether they now plan to ban the sport. "They said, 'We're leaning that way but we can't give you information," he tells the AP.

Story: – President Trump's statement blaming "many sides" for the violence in Charlottesville, Va., is a big topic in newspaper editorials, and Trump isn't getting much support. It's not a huge surprise that the editors at the New York Times are critical, but he's also taking flak from usually friendly sites such as the New York Post: New York Times: A scathing editorial castigates Trump for refusing to personally condemn white supremacists and to instead blame "many sides" for the violence. Trump, the editors write, is "alone in modern presidential history in his willingness to summon demons of bigotry and intolerance in service to himself." Wall Street Journal: Don't make this about Trump, the editors write. In the wake of the violence, Democrats seem to have a sole mission of using the "'white supremacist' cudgel against Trump—as if that is the end of the story." The editorial does fault Trump for failing to respond as a "unifying leader," but it says the focus on his words is a "cop-out because it lets everyone duck the deeper and growing problem of identity politics on the right and left." Washington Post: It takes a here's-what-Trump-should-have said approach and writes him a full statement. "Under whatever labels and using whatever code words—‘heritage,’ ‘tradition,’ ‘nationalism’—the idea that whites or any other ethnic, national or racial group is superior to another is not acceptable," it reads in part. "Americans should not excuse, and I as president will not countenance, fringe elements in our society who peddle such anti-American ideas." New York Post: The paper normally quick to take the president's side thinks he blew it. Trump faulted "many sides" for the violence, but "'many sides' didn't drive a car into a crowd, an evident act of terrorism," the editorial declares. National security adviser HR McMaster says of Trump that it's "clear in his mind" that this "terrorism" can't be tolerated. If so, Trump should "make it clear in his own words, too."

Story: – With a dozen cans of spray paint at his side as evidence, a Singapore judge sentenced two German men today to nine months in jail and three lashes with a cane for vandalizing a train, the Local reports. Andreas Von Knorre, 22, and Elton Hinz, 21, were charged with entering a Singapore train depot in November with spray paint and going to town on a parked train car, the AP notes. They left Singapore, but authorities scooped them up in Malaysia, which extradited them, according to media reports cited by the AP. Singapore is well known for its rigid vandalism laws, notes the BBC, and there have been a couple of high-profile cases of foreigners being caned. Perhaps the most famous: American teenager Michael Fay, who received four lashes for vandalism in 1994, per the New York Times at the time. Fay's caning—which he described to the Times as being between "a few drops [of blood and] blood … gushing out. … It's like a bloody nose"—invited condemnation for the Singapore practice from human rights groups worldwide. The German men's lawyer sought a five-month sentence, per the Local. "I believe they deeply regret their crime," he said, mentioning that family had sent money to the transit company to pay for damages (the check was reportedly returned). "This is the darkest episode of my entire life. I want to apologize to the state of Singapore for the stupid act. … I've learned my lesson and will never do it again," Von Knorre told the court, per Reuters; Hinz offered a similar-sounding apology. But the judge accepted the prosecution's recommended sentence, telling the court the vandalism was "well planned and disrupted public transport," as per Bloomberg.

Story: – Sheryl Sandberg credits Mark Zuckerberg with helping her survive after husband Dave Goldberg's death in 2015 from a heart attack, a fact she recently revealed in an interview to promote her new book, Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy, released Monday by Knopf. Now that the book is out, the reviews are trickling in for the tome, which the Facebook COO co-wrote with Adam Grant, a Wharton psychologist. The book combines Sandberg's personal narrative with data culled by Grant about the strength that people summon to overcome devastating events and rediscover their happiness. Some thoughts from around the internet: Jenny Anderson, who lost her own brother in 2014, describes Sandberg's book as being "as much a guide for the bereaved as a handbook on how to be human" that's "packed with wisdom." Anderson also talks on Quartz about the three Ps that can stifle someone's journey through tremendous grief—personalization, pervasiveness, and permanence—as well as Sandberg's take on "all the friends who don't know what the hell to say or do." In the New York Times, Caitlin Flanagan notes that Sandberg not only discovers "comfort for herself," she's got some to offer her readers, too. Flanagan calls Option B a "remarkable achievement: generous, honest, almost unbearably poignant"—including the exact words she said to break the news about her husband's death to her children. Sandberg "followed the oldest data set in the world, the one that says: The children are young, and you must keep going," Flanagan writes. Rebecca Ruiz writes for Mashable that she wept while reading Sandberg's intimate revelations, and she wants others to "suspend your skepticism" of Sandberg and read the book, too—despite what Ruiz calls the "glaring blindspots" from her first book, Lean In. Although some may think Sandberg isn't relatable, Ruiz notes that Sandberg emerged from her own personal hell because she felt she could be a "conduit" to help others through their own grief. Ruiz also discloses the meaning behind the book's title. Option B is a book of "radical vulnerability," writes Leigh Buchanan for Inc., focusing on the practical advice, "devastating" data, and "multiplier effect of poverty, inequality, and isolation on loss." Buchanan also covers how Sandberg, the consummate professional, handled eventually returning to work, complete with all of her doubts about her performance. One line that stands out to Buchanan: "I have long encouraged people to bring their whole selves to work, but now my 'whole self' was just so freaking sad," Sandberg writes.

Story: – An all-corn diet can quite literally turn a female hamster into a cannibal. A new study found that the European hamster, which once used to feast on a varied diet of grains, roots, and insects, is not doing so well on a diet limited to industrially grown corn. Indeed, the study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, notes that the hamster species is "on the verge of extinction in Western Europe." The all-maize regimen has turned the burrowing critters into "deranged cannibals" that eat their own offspring, the AFP reports. Scientists in northeastern France stumbled on the discovery while studying whether diet affects hamsters' ability to reproduce in the wild. They fed a set of hamsters wheat or corn-based diets, each mixed with worms and clover. Roughly equal numbers of pups were born to mothers fed either diet. But while 80% of pups whose moms ate a wheat-based diet lived to be weaned, only 5% of those fed a corn-based diet made it that far. "Females stored their pups with their hoards of maize before eating them," say the scientists, who noted other unusual behaviors, like the mothers running in circles. The researchers suspected a lack of vitamin B3 (niacin) was to blame, and confirmed it by again feeding the hamsters corn-based diets, but adding B3 for one group; these mothers didn't consume their young. Vitamin B3 deficiency has been linked to unpleasant conditions in dogs (black-tongue syndrome) and humans ("from 1735 to 1940, maize-based diets led to the death of hundreds of thousands of people from pellagra," per the researchers). Read about another food you shouldn't feed hamsters.

Story: – A Sept. 5 blog post on PopFront took Taylor Swift to task for not taking a stand against the white supremacists twisting her music to promote their cause, noting her silence was akin to support. Swift's response has only drawn more reproach. In what an ACLU lawyer calls "a completely unsupported attempt to suppress constitutionally protected speech," Swift's lawyer threatened a lawsuit on Oct. 25 if Meghan Herning's "defamatory" piece wasn’t removed, report Variety and NPR. But as criticism of a public figure, especially opinion, is protected by free speech, Herning wasn't intimidated. Rather than remove the article, she contacted the ACLU, which notes "not even in your wildest dreams" does Herning's commentary "constitute defamation." "Criticism is never pleasant, but a celebrity has to shake it off, even if the critique may damage her reputation," continues the ACLU, taking up Swift's own lyrics against her. The civil liberties group also published the letter Swift's lawyer sent to PopFront—which included a denunciation of white supremacy—despite the lawyer's claim that it was protected from publication by copyright law. It is not because "this is not a commercial use," says the ACLU. "I am not backing down," adds Herning, per Variety. "The press should not be bullied ... or frightened into submission." While Swift's camp has yet to respond, the Washington Post notes celebrities often send cease-and-desist orders in an attempt to erase negative stories even when there's little chance of winning a defamation suit.
Summary: 1. What is the main argument being made in the blog post on PopFront regarding Taylor Swift's silence on white supremacists using her music to promote their cause?2. How did Swift's response to the blog post draw more criticism, according to the article?3.

Story: – Massive offshore wind farms like Sheringham Shoal in England appear to be doing more than converting wind energy. The turbines also serve as artificial reefs, which become rich hunting grounds for seals in the area, according to a report in PhysOrg. Using GPS devices affixed to the backs of 200 gray and harbor seals near offshore wind farms in Britain and Germany, scientists say that while they tracked only a small number venturing into the farms, those that did returned again and again, foraging for fish around the turbines. "I was shocked when I first saw the stunning grid pattern," says one researcher. "You could see that the individual appeared to travel in straight lines between turbines, as if he was checking them out for potential prey and then stopping to forage at certain ones." The LA Times likens the wind farms to "grocery stores" for the seals, and researchers expect the number of those who figure out the trick to grow. But scientists aren't sure whether this is actually good thing in the long run for the seals, because wind farms have unique dangers such as maintenance vehicles and noise pollution. With more of these farms popping up to meet energy demands, scientists say it's more important than ever to understand exactly how they affect the ocean's ecology. (Check out the role giant wind farms may play in the development of hurricanes.)

Story: – Scientists have already found that rats seem to enjoy having their bellies tickled. They let out a noise too high-pitched for the human ear to detect and keep coming back for more. Now, adding to the idea that rats have their own version of a giggle, researchers at the University of Bern in Switzerland report in the journal PLOS ONE that they've also found the rat equivalent of a smile: lowered ears that get quite rosy. They call these "facial indicators of positive emotions" because, though it remains unclear whether rats are actually feeling happiness—the pink ears, for instance, could merely result from increased blood flow due to physical exertion—they do seem to exhibit a positive reaction in their return for more. "While it’s likely that animals do feel emotions, it is unknown if they feel them the same way we do," one researcher tells National Geographic, which reports that rats can be "literally tickled pink," and that their ears droop because their ear muscles relax. The researcher calls himself a "rat-tickling master," and says he found that rats react to tickling differently; the shy and anxious ones, for instance, prefer less rigorous tickling. Researchers have already investigated negative emotions in rats (a "grimace" scale to measure pain exists) in an attempt to inflict less suffering whenever possible, but this is one of the first studies that attempts to sort out a lab rat's positive emotions. (The ability to tickle yourself appears linked to schizophrenia-like traits.)

Story: – The Sicilian mob hated Rudy Giuliani so much when he worked as a federal prosecutor in New York back in the 1980s that it sent a hit man to the US to get rid of him, reports the New York Post. Similar reports have surfaced before, but a mafia turncoat fleshed out the details this week during a trial in Italy. It seems that the head of the Sicilian mafia, Salvatore "Toto" Riina, personally ordered the hit and sent a lackey from Italy to the US with a letter ordering it to take place. Luckily for Giuliani, the Gambino crime family vetoed the idea, knowing that the feds would strike back hard if one of their own were assassinated, reports the Daily News. Giuliani drew the ire of the mob not only for his own crackdown on organized crime but for his close association with an anti-mafia judge in Sicily named Giovanni Falcone. The judge, incidentally, was murdered by mob hitmen in 1992. Giuliani himself has spoken of such plots before, telling Oprah Winfrey last year that he knew of two contracts against him as mayor.

Story: – Helen Smith objects to an essay in the National Review (read it here) that blames pornography for destroying families, distorting men's view of women, increasing rapes, and generally ruining America. The anonymous author even blames porn for causing her husband to leave. Smith's not buying it. For every porn-is-evil study, there's another saying the opposite. And maybe something else is at play, she suggests at Pajamas Media. "Does porn distort men’s attitudes as much as romance novels and Lifetime TV distort women’s? Maybe we should discuss the many social institutions that are giving women unrealistic expectations of men and a sense that they have the right to control men, and men’s sexuality, in their own interest."

Story: – A sweet BBC story in February documented the relationship between 8-year-old Gabi Mann of Seattle and her close bond with the crows in her neighborhood: Since 2013, she'd been feeding them daily, sometimes even offering them her own lunch, then collecting the "gifts" they'd bring back for her in return. But Gabi's Portage Bay neighbors describe something else entirely: a house of horrors that attracts up to 100 cawing crows, seagulls, and pigeons at a time that scatter bird droppings, feathers, dirt, and peanut shells all over the neighborhood and attract rats, the Seattle Times reports. Now at least two neighbors have joined together in a $200,000 suit against Gabi's parents, Lisa and Gary Mann—and other neighbors are considering joining the suit, since they say they've tried talking to the Manns to no avail. One of the neighbors' major beefs: The Manns are framing it as a little girl who's just feeding birds. Not so, the lawyer for the two suing homeowners tells KIRO 7. "The scope and scale of the feeding is not the work of a minor child," she says. "The mother, Lisa Mann, is responsible for the vast majority of [it]. Gary and Lisa Mann have also constructed extraordinarily large feeding stations and hired employees to help carry out the feedings ... and related activities, [which] have run nearly every day, year-round, from the morning hours to as late as midnight." The suit also notes the peanut shell problem—an issue for residents with severe allergies, the Times notes. A trial date has been set, but it's not till Aug. 6, 2016. "My clients hope the feeding will stop before then," the lawyer tells the paper. (There might be something to Gabi's bond with the crows after all.)

Story: – It's been a treasure trove of recently discovered writings from famous authors: first Harper Lee, then Dr. Seuss, and now Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. An 80-year-old man in Scotland says he found a long-lost Sherlock Holmes story that appeared in a 1904 short-story collection, the New York Daily News reports. Walter Elliot says the 1,300-word tale, titled "Sherlock Holmes: Discovering the Border Burgs and, by Deduction, the Brig Bazaar," was contained in a 48-page booklet given to him by a friend more than 50 years ago. The booklet was produced and sold as part of a fundraising effort to replace a wooden bridge that had washed out in Selkirk in 1902, the Daily Record notes. "He really must have thought enough of the town to come down and take part and contribute a story to the book," Elliot tells the Daily News. Without giving too much away, the story is about a journalist who tracks down the renowned detective and finds him talking with (who else) Dr. John Watson about a trip to Edinburgh and a mystery about a "Secret Cabinet." When Watson declines an invitation to go with Holmes, the sleuth uses his powers of deduction to figure out where Watson is headed instead. "I have no idea if it has ever been published—I've never seen it," Elliot tells the Record. "I've always been interested in history, and my family has always passed on stories, and I suppose this was one of the stories that was passed down." The book will reportedly be on display at a local pop-up museum—and you can read the story in full at the Daily Record.

Story: – The Koch brothers are fighting back against the perception (at least on the left) that they're evil personified. The latest salvo comes via a lengthy profile in the Weekly Standard, which argues that the brothers behind Koch Industries are "demonized" by liberals who see them as "convenient scapegoats." Remember that prank phone call between a fake David Koch and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker? No wonder Walker didn't recognize Koch, writes Matthew Continetti—they'd never spoken before. Yet Koch was portrayed as pulling all the strings. "The press attacked me rather than the guy who impersonated me!" complains David. "And I was criticized as someone who’s got a death grip on the governor and his policies. And that I control him—I mean, that’s insane!” The article says the brothers were content to remain low-key until President Obama's policies raised a national debate about the size and scope of government. (The smaller the better, as far they're concerned.) Of note: David Koch on Obama: “He’s the most radical president we’ve ever had as a nation and has done more damage to the free enterprise system and long-term prosperity than any president we’ve ever had.” Why? His dad was a "hard core economic socialist," which means Obama "had sort of antibusiness, anti-free enterprise influences affecting him almost all his life." Charles Koch on Obama: “He’s a dedicated egalitarian. I’m not saying he’s a Marxist, but he’s internalized some Marxist models—that is, that business tends to be successful by exploiting its customers and workers.” The full profile is here.

How does the article portray the Koch brothers' motivations and goals, and what are they hoping to achieve through their political activities?
Story: – For a man more accustomed to choosing reality-TV show contestants, Donald Trump seems to have done a superb job of picking conservative-pleasing potential Supreme Court nominees. The candidate released a list of 11 possible Antonin Scalia replacements on Wednesday, and it's been praised by leading conservatives and denounced by liberals, suggesting Trump made good on his promise to let the conservative Heritage Foundation do most of the choosing for him. A roundup of coverage: The list of nominees, most of whom clerked for Scalia or other conservative SCOTUS justices, is "pretty much everything a conservative activist could hope for," writes Scott Lemieux at the Guardian. He notes that all the nominees are white and only three of them are women, but since all the current justices went to either Harvard or Yale, Trump deserves credit for including graduates of the University of Chicago, Marquette, the University of Minnesota, Duke, Washington University, Tulane, and the University of Michigan. Nan Aron, chief of the liberal Alliance for Justice, says Trump has released a "dangerous" list. It "includes some of the most extreme conservatives on the federal bench today," she tells the New York Times. "Their opinions demonstrate open hostility to Americans' rights and liberties, including reproductive justice and environmental, consumer, and worker protections. They have ruled consistently in favor of the powerful over everyone else. They would move the needle even further to the right on the Supreme Court." At the staunchly anti-Trump conservative site RedState, Leon Wolf argues that the candidate has released the list to "allay conservative fears," but anybody who believes Trump is likely to actually nominate any of them may have just fallen off the turnip truck. "Trump has lied or flip-flopped about literally everything during the course of this primary," he writes. Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen tells the AP that her inclusion on the list came as a "complete surprise." She says she's honored to be included and would definitely be interested in serving, though she won't discuss her opinion of Trump. Another candidate, Don Willett of the Texas Supreme Court, has made numerous tweets mocking Trump, reports Reuters. In one, he jokes about "Darth Trump" building the Death Star. Another is a haiku about Trump choosing Supreme Court nominees. "Who would the Donald name to #SCOTUS? The mind reels. *weeps—can't finish tweet*" he writes.

Story: – A bill passed by Utah's House of Representatives gives schools a choice: Teach sex education that's all about not having sex, or drop sex ed. The bill, which allows schools to skip sex education, and bars those that keep it from discussing contraception, was passed 45-28 after a heated discussion about morality, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. All 17 of the chamber's Democrats voted against it, along with 11 Republicans. Attempts to water the bill down and make sex education abstinence-centered instead of abstinence-only were defeated. Asked what an abstinence-only sex education course would involve, the bill's sponsor suggested lessons on friendship, dating, and love, reports the Deseret News. "Why don't we just be honest with our children and tell them right up front that sex outside of marriage is devastating?" he asked. The bill now heads for the state Senate.

Story: – Much like rampaging zombies, brain cells on cocaine can't stop eating brains, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Scientists already knew that the drug killed brain cells, but "autopsies" on the dead brain cells of mice given '70s-rock-star levels of cocaine revealed that the cells had been killed when autophagy—the process by which cells absorb unwanted debris—went completely out of control and the cells began devouring vital parts of themselves, the Guardian reports. The same effect was seen in the babies of mice given large amounts of cocaine while pregnant. "A cell is like a household that is constantly generating trash," the paper's lead author, neuroscientist Prasun Guha, explains in a press release. "Autophagy is the housekeeper that takes out the trash—it's usually a good thing. But cocaine makes the housekeeper throw away really important things, like mitochondria, which produce energy for the cell." ITV reports that the researchers found a possible antidote, an experimental drug called CGP3466B that's been tested to treat diseases like Parkinson's, though they say that there will have to be a lot more research on humans before it could be considered for use reducing the damage from cocaine use. (Tests on pipes from Shakespeare's garden suggest that the Bard smoked more than tobacco.)
Summary: 1. Can you explain the process of autophagy and how it normally works in cells?2. How did the researchers determine that cocaine disrupts autophagy in brain cells, and what specific effects did they observe?3.

How did the researchers test the effectiveness of the experimental drug CGP3466B in treating the damage caused by cocaine use, and what were the results?5. What are the implications of the study's findings for our understanding of cocaine addiction and the long-term effects of drug use on the brain?6. How does the study's focus on mice and cell cultures inform our understanding of the effects of cocaine on the human brain, and what are the limitations of these models?7. What are some potential avenues for future research on the effects of cocaine on the brain and the development of treatments for cocaine addiction?8. How does the study's finding that cocaine disrupts autophagy in brain cells relate to other research on the drug's effects on the brain and behavior?9. What are the potential ethical implications of using experimental drugs like CGP3466B to treat cocaine addiction, and how would these drugs need to be tested and regulated?10. How does the study's findings contribute to our broader understanding of the complex interactions between drugs, the brain, and behavior, and how can this knowledge be used to develop more effective treatments for drug addiction?
Story: – Tony Curtis, the screen icon best known for starring in Some Like It Hot with Marilyn Monroe and Jack Lemmon, has died of cardiac arrest aged 85 at his Las Vegas home. His daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis, confirmed to Entertainment Tonight that her father had passed away. Curtis—who appeared in more than 100 films in a screen career that spanned seven decades—was nominated for an Academy Award for his role in 1959's The Defiant Ones. Curtis, born to a Bronx tailor, started his career as a '50s heartthrob before becoming a respected actor, the AP notes. After battling drug and alcohol addiction, he became a character actor in his later years and started painting, selling works for as much as $20,000.

Story: – President Trump's pick to replace James Comey as head of the FBI appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday for his confirmation hearing and testified that his loyalty would be to the law, not to the White House. "No one asked me for any kind of loyalty oath during any part of this process," Christopher Wray said, referencing the supposed loyalty oath Trump wanted from Comey before he fired him. Wray said that were he to be asked for one, he wouldn't give it. USA Today notes that during his opening remarks, Wray—a former assistant attorney general and current lawyer—never mentioned Trump by name, but said, "I believe to my core that there is only one right way to do this job and that is strict independence—without fear, without favoritism and certainly without regard to any partisan influence." Wray also testified that, though he wouldn't oversee the investigation into Russia's tampering with the 2016 US election, he'd protect the probe headed by special counsel Robert Mueller from outside tampering, ABC News reports. He was also asked about Donald Trump Jr.'s controversial emails with a Russian lawyer, noting he was "not in a position" to comment in detail about it, CBS News reports. Wray, who was the head of the Justice Department task force that convicted former Enron execs, has so far seen support from both sides of the aisle, but he worked on counterterrorist operations post-9/11, and the ACLU's national political director says he should be questioned about the Bush administration's detainee torture, per USA Today. Wray's ex-colleagues speak highly of him, and one says he knows of no reason his nomination would be blocked. Fox News has live updates on the hearing.

Story: – A Stanford study finds that kids from low-income families begin falling behind their richer peers in language development earlier than thought, reports the New York Times. The study found clear differences at 18 months, with kids in the higher-income families able to identify simple words a lot faster. (A previous study decades ago spotted differences at age 3.) One new yardstick: It wasn't until the lower-income kids were 2 years old that they could match the speed of the richer 18-month-olds. That's presumably because the richer parents were more often talking to their children. "These disparities are equivalent to a six-month gap between infants from rich and poor families in both language processing skills and vocabulary knowledge," the lead researcher told the Standford Report when the study surfaced last month. "What we're seeing here is the beginning of a developmental cascade, a growing disparity between kids that has enormous implications for their later educational success and career opportunities." The results will likely come into play in the DC debate over the funding of prekindergarten programs, notes the Times.
Summary: 1. What are the specific language development milestones that the study found to be delayed in children from low-income families?2. How did the researchers control for other factors that could influence language development, such as parental education level or home environment?3. What is the significance of the finding that the gap between rich and poor children in language development begins as early as 18 months?4.

What are the implications of the study's findings for early childhood education and intervention programs, particularly in the context of the DC debate over prekindergarten funding?6. How does the study's finding of a developmental cascade (i.e., a growing disparity between rich and poor children) suggest that early intervention may be critical in closing the gap in language development?7. What are the potential long-term consequences of the language development gap found in the study for children's educational attainment and career opportunities?8. How does the study's finding of a gap in language development between rich and poor children in the United States compare to other countries or cultural contexts?9. What are the potential policy implications of the study's findings for addressing the language development gap in low-income families, particularly in the context of early childhood education and intervention programs?10.

Story: – People don't get flesh-eating bacteria very often, but it happens—and it's good to know it when you see it, LiveScience reports. A South Carolina man nearly lost an arm this week after contracting the infection while swimming, per WSPA, and USA Today reports on nine cases in Virginia this summer, including one fatality. One study found roughly four cases for every 100,000 Americans every year. That said, here's what you need to know: People usually contract the ailment, known by doctors as necrotizing fasciitis, with a break in the skin that allows bacteria to enter. Think burns, scrapes, cuts, and surgical wounds, says the CDC. Watch out for "pain that's out of proportion" with the wound, says one doctor. Patients may also notice crackling sensations or noises caused by air beneath the tissue. At the outset, look for a red or swollen patch of skin surrounding the wound that expands faster than usual, and pain beyond the red patch. Such symptoms will begin within hours and should send you to a doctor right away. Other possible side-effects include chills, body aches, stomachache, nausea, diarrhea, and fever—in other words, flu-like symptoms. Later on, watch for possible black spots, oozing pus, blisters, or ulcers. If allowed to spread, the bacteria may cause confusion and even delirium. The pain might also subside as necrotizing fasciitis destroys the person's nerves, according to experts at the National Institute of Health. Anyone can get flesh-eating bacteria, but it's often people with other health issues that diminish their power to stave off infection, like liver disease, cancer, kidney disease, or diabetes. Wounds exposed to seawater are also risky. Anyone with necrotizing fasciitis should get aggressive treatment immediately. Mortality rates usually hover between 25% and 35%, but sometimes reach 50%. One boy died from flesh-eating bacteria after falling off his bike.
Summary: 1. What is necrotizing fasciitis, and how is it caused?2. What are the common symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis, and how do they progress?3. Who is most at risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis, and why?4. What are the possible complications of necrotizing fasciitis, and how can they be treated?5. What is the mortality rate of necrotizing fasciitis, and why does it vary?6. Can you provide any examples of cases of necrotizing fasciitis, and how were they treated?7. Are there any preventive measures that can be taken to avoid developing necrotizing fasciitis?8. How can doctors diagnose necrotizing fasciitis, and what are the diagnostic criteria?9. How long does it take for necrotizing fasciitis to develop after a wound has been infected?10. Are there any ongoing research or developments in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis?By asking these questions, we can gain a deeper understanding of the text and the topic of necrotizing fasciitis, including its causes, symptoms, risk factors, treatment options, and mortality rate.
Story: – Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo has died at age 61, the AP reports. Liu, the country's most prominent political prisoner, was first put behind bars in 1989 in connection with the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. His fourth and last prison sentence, for inciting subversion thanks to his work advocating for more human rights and political reforms in China, began in 2008, BuzzFeed reports. He was awarded the Nobel in 2010. Liu, who had been hospitalized for advanced liver cancer that was diagnosed in May, died of multiple organ failure. China had said he was receiving the best care in the country and that he wasn't medically cleared to travel abroad for treatment, but doctors had recently disagreed. The White House had renewed calls for Liu's release this week, the Guardian reports. He died in a hospital in China, still under police custody, making him the second Nobel Peace Prize winner to die while in custody. Friends, supporters, and fellow activists are expressing their grief over his death, with some calling for Liu's wife, Liu Xia, to be allowed to leave China, the AP reports. She was put under house arrest after Liu won the Nobel, despite having been convicted of no crime; China was angered by the prize being awarded to Liu. Liu was a visiting scholar at New York's Columbia University when he returned to China in May 1989 to join the movement challenging the Communist Party; his first prison sentence lasted almost two years. He was detained again in 1995 after writing a plea for political reform, then again later that year for co-authoring another paper regarding problems in China. That sentence lasted three years.

Story: – The bodies of three soldiers who were never recovered from a sunken WWII aircraft may finally get their homecoming. LiveScience reports that possible human remains were recovered from a B-24 bomber nicknamed the Tulsamerican that crashed off the coast of Croatia toward the end of the war, some 73 years ago. Damaged during battle with the German air force, the aircraft lost power and crashed into the Adriatic Sea. While seven of its passengers were rescued, three airmen were never found. Per KTUL, when the wreckage was discovered in 2010, finding those soldiers became a project many were drawn to, including assistant DA Kevin Gray of Tulsa (where the bomber was manufactured). "You've got people spending millions of dollars trying to find Amelia Earhart," Gray says. "This is our own Amelia Earhart." Coordinated by the US military's Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the recovery effort was launched soon after the wreck’s discovery to head off looting. Dr. Brendan Foley, an underwater archaeologist from Lund University, called the recovery "incredibly emotional" and "the most worthwhile thing we've ever done underwater." In an interview with LiveScience, he described the nose portion of the plane "almost peeled open like a banana" from the impact of the crash, but said parts like seats were still distinguishable in the two sections found 135 feet below the surface. Along with any materials that resembled bone (that will undergo DNA testing), the divers brought back soil where artifacts may be buried as well as equipment and clothes that could belong to the servicemen. The US Embassy Zagreb thanked the Croatian government for its assistance on Facebook, linking to stunning video footage of the recovery efforts. (A hiker spotted this WWII crash in India.)

Story: – Many US cities have been making the move from sodium street lights to LEDs—the bulbs are not only up to 50% more energy efficient than their predecessors, but they last for as many as 20 years and distribute light more evenly. Unfortunately, numerous studies suggest that the levels of blue light in the high-intensity LED bulbs could have health ramifications, including sleep problems and even increased risk for cancer and heart disease. The evidence is apparently strong enough to prompt the American Medical Association to issue a warning in June that LED street lights can impair and even damage nighttime vision, reports Tech Times. Problem is, almost 13% of roadway lighting now uses LEDs, with many places planning a switch, reports the Washington Post. Seattle has been downright dismissive of any health concerns, while New York has gone so far as to switch to lower-intensity LED bulbs the AMA considers safe when residents complain. Lake Worth, Fla., meanwhile, has plans to replace its sodium street lights with more than 4,000 LED lights that have less of the potentially harmful blue light and more of an amber hue, while Gloucester, Mass., has consulted its own residents and decided to play it safe and go with less blue in their LEDs, which they'll finish installing next month. But not everybody's convinced the danger is real: "Nobody says don’t watch television or use your computer after 9pm because of blue lights," grouses one Phoenix official to the Post. (This major company is making the switch to LEDs.)

Story: – Tea Party gatherings are being used by white supremacist and other hate groups to recruit members and spread their ideas, according to a new study by the NAACP. The "links between certain Tea Party factions and acknowledged racist hate groups in the US should give all patriotic Americans pause," warns the reports by the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights. The head of the NAACP in a forward to the report called on the party's leadership to "distance themselves" from those within the party who "espouse racist ideas, advocate violence or are formally affiliated with white supremacist" organizations. "The danger is not that the majority of Tea Party members share their views, but that left unchecked, these extremists might indirectly influence the direction of the Tea Party and therefore the direction of our country," writes Ben Jealous. Tea Party representatives blasted the findings. "The claim of racism is so stupid it defies response," said Sal Russo, a Sacramento-based Republican political consultant who created the Tea Party Express. "The movement has nothing to do with race whatsoever." Gary Dunn, a contributor to the party's Free Republic website, said moderators quickly remove any posted racist comments, reports the Guardian.

Story: – The gunman who opened fire at a high school in La Loche, Saskatchewan yesterday killed his two brothers first, according to the remote town's acting mayor, who lost his own daughter in the shooting. "He shot two of his brothers at his home and made his way to the school," Kevin Janvier tells the AP. "I'm just so sad." He says 23-old teacher Marie Janvier, who was shot dead at La Loche Community School, was his only child. At a Friday night press conference, a police spokeswoman confirmed that the death toll is four and a male suspect is in custody, though she didn't confirm the number of wounded or the identities of the victims, the CBC reports. Janvier tells CTV that the alleged shooter, who was arrested outside the school 45 minutes after police were called at around 1pm Friday, is under 21. The Saskatoon StarPhoenix reports that according to a student, the suspect made a chilling post on social media before the shooting. "Just killed 2 ppl," he wrote. "Bout to shoot ip the school." A crisis team of tribal elders and professionals is on its way to the aboriginal community, reports the StarPhoenix, which notes that La Loche and the surrounding area has the highest suicide rate in the province, with 43.4 suicide deaths per 100,000, more than triple the Saskatchewan average. According to the National Post, Friday's incident is believed to be the worst-ever shooting at a high school in Canada.

Story: – The family of South African teacher Pierre Korkie was expecting him to be released by al-Qaeda tomorrow after 18 months of captivity in Yemen, reports Sky News. Instead, he was killed today as US commandos tried to free fellow hostage Luke Somers, an American. "His passport was ready, everything was ready," an official with the charity group Gift of the Givers, which had been negotiating Korkie's release, tells the BBC. The charity had informed his wife, Yolande, earlier in the week that he'd be home for Christmas, but its president makes clear that he does not blame the US: "There is no bad feeling toward anyone." The charity's account of Korkie's pending freedom has not been been verified by US officials, but if true he got caught up in tragic timing. President Obama authorized the rescue attempt this morning because US authorities feared Somers was about to be killed. Both men were brought from the compound alive but died later from gunshot wounds that US officials say came from al-Qaeda, not American troops. Obama offered his condolences to the Korkie family, saying the hostage was "murdered by these terrorists during the rescue operation," reports South Africa's Mail & Guardian. Both Pierre and Yolande Korkie were seized last year in Yemen, though Yolande was freed in January. (Click to read about how the rescue attempt went wrong.)

Story: – Police are hunting what they call a "person of interest" after two improvised explosive devices went off at a mall in central Florida Sunday evening, causing damage and a small fire but no injuries. Police in Lake Wales say the pipe bombs went off in a service corridor near the entrance of the Eagle Ridge Mall's JC Penney store, WFTV reports. The mall was quickly evacuated after the IEDs went off around 5:20pm, reports ABC News. Authorities say the devices caused damage to a drop ceiling and to the wall of a docking area where trucks load and unload cargo. A backpack was found at the scene. Police say the person they're seeking is a middle-aged white male with a heavy/stocky build who was seen wearing a gray shirt and gray hat. The Polk County Sheriff's Office, the State Fire Marshal, and the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office Bomb Squad have joined the investigation, the Ledger reports.

Story: – Robert Gates confirmed today that the US is in "preliminary" talks with the Taliban, reports the Hill, cautioning that they've only been going on for a "few weeks." Appearing on State of the Union and Fox News Sunday, the outgoing defense secretary said the State Department was handling talks—though not at the level of Hillary Clinton—but that he didn't expect "substantive headway until at least this winter. "I think the Taliban have to feel themselves under military pressure and begin to believe that they can't win before they are willing to have a serious conversation." Elsewhere on the Sunday dial, as per Politico: Gates on War Powers Act: "President Obama has complied with the law consistent in a manner with virtually all of his predecessors. From our standpoint at the Pentagon, we're involved in a limited kinetic operation." John McCain on WPA backlash: "I would say to my Republican friends, if this were a Republican president, would you be trying to impose these same conditions? We don't want to do anything ... which would encourage Gadhafi to remain in power." Lindsey Graham on why Congress should 'shut up' on WPA: "The president's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya—but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or cut off our effort to bring Gadhafi down." Graham on GOP candidates waffling on Afghanistan: "If you think the pathway to the GOP nomination is to get to Barack Obama's left, you're going to meet a lot of headwinds." David Axelrod on Jon Huntsman's tenure as ambassador: "What has changed is not his view of the economy, but his view of his own chances to, perhaps, win the nomination. That's politics." But, "He was encouraging on the whole range of issues. He was a little quizzical about what was going on in his own party. And you got the strong sense that he was going to wait until 2016 for the storm to blow over."

Story: – Audra McDonald has become the Tony Awards' most decorated actress last night when she won her sixth Tony for portraying Billie Holiday in Lady Day at Emerson's Bar & Grill. The win put the singer and actress ahead of five-time winners Angela Lansbury and the late Julie Harris for the most competitive wins by an actress. The latest win—for best lead actress in a play—also makes McDonald the first grand-slam performance winner. She previously won as best featured actress in a play (A Raisin in the Sun and Master Class), best lead actress in a musical (The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess) and best featured actress in a musical (Ragtime and Carousel). She also has two Grammys. A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder took home the best new musical trophy and three others, tying it as most decorated show of the night with Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Hedwig was led by Neil Patrick Harris, and the former Tony host got his first award—best actor in a musical—after performing a song from the show, looking unrecognizable in a miniskirt and blond feathered wig. He gave audience member Sting a lap dance and took Samuel L. Jackson's glasses away and licked them. Click for more of the best moments from the award show, or a list of the biggest winners.

Story: – After sweeping the Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington state caucuses on Saturday, Bernie Sanders is looking ahead to what could be a decisive battle in New York state. The delegate-rich state holds its Democratic primary on April 19, and the Brooklyn-born Sanders plans a major push to defeat Hillary Clinton in the state she once represented, the Washington Post reports. "We'll be the underdog, but being the underdog in New York is not the worst situation in politics," says Tad Devine, Sanders' chief strategist. "We're going to make a real run for it." Sanders plans an upbeat campaign stressing his "New York values," Devine says, though he'll also target Clinton for her ties to Wall Street. The next state to vote is Wisconsin on April 5, and Devine says Sanders hopes victory there will give him a boost heading into New York. CBS News reports that Sanders has challenged Clinton to debate him in New York in April—"New York City, upstate, wherever." Whichever Democrat wins the nomination will be facing a New Yorker in the general election if Donald Trump wins the GOP race, though the state hasn't voted Republican in a presidential election since 1984, and polls suggest there's little chance of it flipping this year, the Hill reports. A political science professor at Syracuse University says he would be tempted to bet his house that Clinton would beat Trump in a general election, especially since the nomination race has pushed her to the left, which "makes her even more appealing in a state like New York."

Story: – It sounds straight out of Jurassic Park: Researchers have successfully created chicken embryos with what LiveScience frames as Velociraptor-like snouts. It's an end that has its beginning in a bird-dino quandary described by Carl Zimmer at the New York Times: "Even the most exquisitely preserved fossil can't tell us which pieces of DNA had to change in order to turn ground-running dinosaurs into modern birds." When it comes to birds' beaks specifically, scientists have understood the parts—premaxillae, the pair of cranial bones that hold some of our own teeth, fused to form the beak. But the genetic changes that facilitated the evolution from a snout weren't known. Zimmer digs deep into the science of the beak reversion, as detailed in the journal Evolution (it's worth a read), but the BBC puts it in layman's terms: The researchers "isolated the proteins that would have gone on to develop beaks. Then they suppressed them using tiny beads coated with an inhibiting substance." And voila: Instead of fused beaks, unfused and rounded bones began to develop. Lead researcher Bhart-Anjan Bhullar specifies that what was altered were gene-produced proteins, not genes, and therefore they're weren't genetically modifying the chickens. And those embryos didn't come to term. "They actually probably wouldn't have done that badly if they did hatch," he tells LiveScience. "Mostly, though, we were interested in the evolution of the beak, and not in hatching a 'dino-chicken' just for the sake of it."

Story: – The latest trophy hunter to spark the internet's rage is a Kentucky woman who posed for a photo with the giraffe she killed on a trip to South Africa. The South Africa-based AfricLand Post website tweeted the pictures earlier this month along with the message, "White american savage who is partly a neanderthal comes to Africa and shoot down a very rare black giraffe coutrsey [sic] of South Africa stupidity." The photos, which were taken during a hunting trip in June 2017, quickly went viral, with many (including actors Ricky Gervais and Debra Messing) sharing them on various social media sites; one Twitter user shared a screenshot of the original Facebook post by Tess Thompson Talley with the pictures, since deleted or made private. "Prayers for my once in a lifetime dream hunt came true today!" she said in the post, per USA Today. "Spotted this rare black giraffe bull and stalked him for quite awhile. ... He was over 18 years old, 4,000 lbs and was blessed to be able to get 2,000 lbs of meat." But a giraffe expert tells Yahoo! the type of giraffe shown is not rare and its numbers are actually increasing in the wild. Talley defended her kill with a statement to Fox News, saying that the giraffe "was the South African sub-species of giraffe" and that its numbers are "actually increasing due, in part, to hunters and conservation efforts paid for in large part by big game hunting." She added that the "breed is not rare in any way other than it was very old." She also said the giraffe was too old to breed, but had killed three younger males, calling what she did "conservation through game management."

Story: – The Nigerian man in custody after yesterday's failed attempt to blow up a plane has been charged with trying to bring down the airliner. Federal authorities say Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab tried to use a highly explosive chemical known as PETN, reports CBS. He reportedly kept the substance near his groin in a plastic pouch, maybe a condom, then tried to ignite it with a syringe filled with chemicals. Mutallab remains in a Detroit hospital with third-degree burns after being tackled on the plane and handcuffed. Federal authorities had him on a list of people with known or suspected ties to terrorists for 2 years, reports AP. But he was not on the federal do-not-fly list.

Story: – Survivors of the Iranian hostage crisis will be awarded up to $4.4 million each, more than three decades after their 444 days in captivity. The terms are laid out in a spending bill President Obama signed into law last week, which also includes reparation for victims of other terrorist attacks, including the 1998 US Embassy bombings in East Africa, reports the New York Times. The 1981 agreement that secured the release of those taken hostage at the US Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979, barred them from seeking amends. Legal appeals were later blocked, though renewed pleas for compensation followed the release of 2012's Argo. Finally, when bank BNP Paribas was forced to pay $9 billion for violating sanctions against Iran, Sudan, and Cuba, this year, Congress moved to set aside $1 billion for terrorism victims. The 37 surviving hostages will receive up to $10,000 per day of captivity, while spouses and children can receive a lump sum of up to $600,000, per the Times. The money should be awarded within a year. "The money can't bring back family members, or the 444 days of their lives. But it would bring some closure and some justice," Georgia Sen. Johnny Isakson tells the Telegraph. "I had to pull over to the side of the road, and I basically cried," a former embassy security guard says of hearing the news, noting it took "36 years, one month, 14 days" for Iran to be held accountable. "I don't believe that they will ever, ever apologize," he adds. "They don't believe that they did anything wrong." Officials note many of the hostages were tortured and continue to suffer, including from PTSD. The law signed Friday also designates $2.8 billion for victims of the 9/11 attacks and their families.

Story: – Bad boy Arnold Schwarzenegger 'fessed up on 60 Minutes last night that he had a number of affairs while he was married to Maria Shriver. He reveals in his new book that he had a "hot" fling with Brigitte Nielsen (although that one was before his marriage to Shriver). “I did feel bad about it,” he told Lesley Stahl. "But all of my various different things, they were mistakes. This is my failure." He admitted to having "other" affairs, but didn't reveal details, explaining: "It's something that's obviously between Maria and me." Stahl asked: "So it's a recurring thing with you?" and the Terminator replied: “I’m not perfect." He called his affair with the family housekeeper—which produced a son and led to the breakup of his marriage—“the stupidest thing I’ve done. I inflicted tremendous pain on Maria and unbelievable pain on the kids.” The "thing that really meant the most to me kinda fell apart because of my doing," he added. "That is something that I will always look back and say, ‘How could you have done that?’” Shriver hasn't yet read the book, but the extremely optimistic Schwarzenegger believes that "Maria is, you know, wishing me well with everything that I do.”

Story: – Demi Lovato has been officially accused of stealing a song. The indie duo Sleigh Bells first accused Lovato more than nine months ago of ripping off parts of its 2010 song, "Infinity Guitars," in her "Stars." But now the band has filed a federal complaint about the matter, the Los Angeles Times reports. The copyright lawsuit names Lovato along with two producers and the owner of her record label, and it specifically calls out the production of the song, noting that parts of the two are "virtually identical," E! reports. "A comparison of the two songs reveals that, at the very least, the combination of the hand claps and bass drum, structured as 3 quarter beats and a rest, with the bass drum providing a counter-rhythm to the hand claps, is at least substantially similar in both works," says the complaint, which notes that the similarities "transcend the realm of coincidence." Sleigh Bells accused Lovato of sampling "Infinity Guitars" when "Stars" first came out, and her producers denied doing so and also denied Lovato was involved in the production of the song, per the Hollywood Reporter.

Story: – Florida will be one of the most important states in play in next week's election, and the Tampa Bay Times has provided a strange, if entertaining, exploration of what a certain type of voter there might do. This voter is known as Florida Man. You know him—he pops up regularly in headlines after committing an only-in-Florida kind of crime. The newspaper managed to track down 11 of them, one technically being Florida Woman (accused of assaulting her twin sister in an argument involving a vibrator). The results? It's pretty good news for Hillary Clinton, who wins 7-4, though Florida Woman is in the Trump camp. Some samples: "I think Trump is an utter madman, so there's really no other choice," says Clinton supporter Malcolm Brenner, who gained infamy for having sex with a dolphin. “Donald Trump by far," counters Anthony Berden, who was arrested for roaming a park dressed as a dinosaur and carrying an air rifle.

Story: – US employers ramped up hiring last month and more Americans began looking for work, a sign that President Trump has inherited a robust job market, reports AP. The Labor Department says employers added 227,000 jobs in January, the most since September and higher than last year's average monthly gain of 187,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to a low 4.8% last month from 4.7% in December. Yet the rate rose for a mostly good reason: More Americans started looking for work. The percentage of adults working or looking for jobs increased to its highest level since September. Yet some of the economy's weak spots remain: Average hourly wages barely increased last month. And the number of people working part-time but who would prefer full-time work rose. A blog post at the Wall Street Journal notes that the retail sector added the most new jobs in January (46,000), which is unusual in that it's a post-holiday month. "Who said the mall is dead?"

Story: – Jocelyn Bell Burnell was a PhD student at Cambridge University some five decades ago when she made an astronomical discovery while reviewing data from a radio telescope: faint, repeating pulses of radio waves. These signals came to be known as pulsars, a type of neutron star described by Scientific American as "a city-sized collapsed core of a massive sun that is made of degenerate matter and throws off lighthouse-like beams of radio waves." The discovery was a leap forward: It pointed to the existence of black holes, provided evidence for gravitational waves, and much more. It also yielded a 1974 Nobel Prize—but not for Bell Burnell. Instead, the prize went to Antony Hewish, Bell Burnell's PhD supervisor, the Guardian reports. Bell Burnell's exclusion from the Nobel Prize has been cited as proof of sexism in astronomy. But, since then, Bell Burnell has won plenty of other accolades. "I feel I've done very well out of not getting a Nobel Prize," she tells the Guardian. "If you get the Nobel Prize you have this fantastic week and nobody gives you anything else. If you don't get the Nobel Prize, you get everything that moves. That's much more fun." And in November, Bell Burnell will receive another honor: the Breakthrough Prize, a $3 million award funded by Silicon Valley types, such as Mark Zuckerberg. She "thoroughly deserves this recognition," says Yuri Milner, who founded the Breakthrough Prize, per SA, adding that she "revealed one of the most interesting objects in the universe." Bell Burnell says she'll give the prize money to the Institute of Physics to fund graduate scholarships for groups that are underrepresented in physics, per the AP.

Story: – This year's gathering in Cleveland promised to be the most unconventional GOP convention in decades, and Day 1 did not disappoint, although the Republican Party probably isn't entirely thrilled about how things are shaping up. Here are some of the winners and losers analysts named after the day's events. Among the winners: Donald Trump's ego. His entrance Thursday night, complete with a smoke machine and "We Are the Champions," was "epic," writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post, who says he has always wanted politics to be more like pro wrestling. Social conservatives. On Monday, the party adopted a platform that some are calling the most conservative ever, the AP reports. Christian conservatives praised it for being "the most pro-life platform ever," and for opposing same-sex marriage and bathroom choice for transgender individuals. They also loved this line: "Children raised in a traditional two-parent household tend to be physically and emotionally healthier, less likely to use drugs and alcohol, engage in crime, or become pregnant outside of marriage." Rudy Giuliani. The former New York City mayor delivered what was deemed one of the more impressive Day 1 speeches, reports the Huffington Post, which was particularly impressed by the fact that he didn't mention 9/11 once as he warned about America being in danger, though he did spend time talking about Benghazi. Richard Nixon. Looks like Nixon is back in fashion: Trump's allies "proudly portrayed him as the heir to Richard M. Nixon" and his "law and order" message, which appears to be Trump and the convention's main inspiration, according to the New York Times. Among the losers: Melania Trump. She was widely praised after a speech that touched on Trump's softer side, but her remarks were quickly overshadowed by accusations that she—or her speechwriters—had plagiarized Michelle Obama's 2008 Democratic National Convention speech, the Hill reports. The Never Trump movement. There were angry scenes Monday as Trump opponents tried and failed to "unbind" delegates, making it a certainty that Trump will become the GOP nominee. Sen. Joni Ernst. The Iowan is a rising GOP star, Cillizza notes, but she wasn't scheduled to speak until after 11pm Eastern, long after Melania Trump spoke and the Quicken Loans Arena emptied, "meaning that the number of eyeballs on her were WAY fewer than she and her allies would have liked."

Story: – By all accounts, Zamira Hajiyeva has had it pretty good. For instance, the BBC reports, the London resident owns two properties valued at about $29 million and a Gulfstream jet worth more than $40 million, and she's had the resources to spend some $21 million at the London department store Harrods over the past decade. But she also has a husband, Jahangir Hajiyev, who is serving 15 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and embezzlement in his capacity as chairman of the International Bank of Azerbaijan. It all adds up to Hajiyeva becoming the first ever target of the UK's new Unexplained Wealth Order power, which targets foreign officials suspected of laundering stolen money through the UK. In this case, Hajiyeva, 55, must explain how she paid for the two aforementioned properties, per CNN, which include a home in London and golf course estate in Berkshire. If she's unable to do that, she risks having the assets seized. In 2009, the according to the BBC, a company in the British Virgin Islands, ultimately traced to Hajiyeva and her husband, bought the London property. Another company linked to them bought the golf estate in 2013. Hajiyeva is living in the UK under a visa program for wealthy investors. Hajiyeva has denied any wrongdoing. The director of the UK's National Crime Agency says Unexplained Wealth Orders should be used more broadly to target some $6 billion in suspicious wealth.

Story: – A multistate manhunt for a Tennessee man is underway after he allegedly confessed via Facebook that he'd killed his mother and best friend. The New York Daily News reports Casey Lawhorn, 22 or 23, said Sunday in the now-deleted post that he used a stolen gun early that morning to first shoot his friend, identified as Avery Gaines, 22, as he slept, then his own mother, Vi Lawhorn, whom he described as being too drunk to realize what was happening, USA Today reports. Per WTVC, police who arrived at the East Ridge home where the crime took place (Lawhorn called 911 before fleeing) found two bodies, later identified as Gaines and Lawhorn's mother. "She started screaming the worst scream I've ever heard," Lawhorn wrote in the post about shooting his mom. "Movies really don't do justice to how true terror sounds." East Ridge Police Assistant Chief Stan Allen tells ABC News the Facebook post—part of which can be seen in a Twitter screenshot via the Jasper County News—appears to be authentic, as details sync up to what cops found at the crime scene. By 7pm Sunday, police in Jasper County, Miss., say they'd found the 2002 Ford Taurus that Lawhorn was driving abandoned on I59 near the Vossburg exit, and they're warning locals Lawhorn is "armed" and "very dangerous." In the post, Lawhorn says he was having issues at college and was suicidal, and he implored anyone reading it to look after his younger brother. He says his car broke down on the I59, after which he apparently made the Facebook post. "What I look forward to is the nothingness after death," he wrote. "I've spent a lot of time thinking about murder, wondering what it feels like. But I've barely felt anything."

Story: – Last week, as the US prepared for military strikes, an elite Syrian military unit once again moved the Assad regime's chemical stockpiles. Unit 450, an all-Alawite squad so secretive that even high-ranking military defectors aren't aware of its existence, has been divvying up and dispersing its stockpiles for months, US and Middle Eastern officials tell the Wall Street Journal. Officials believe the regime's 1,000 metric tons of chemical agents, once concentrated in a few large stores, are now scattered to as many as 50 locations across Syria. "We know a lot less than we did six months ago about where the chemical weapons are," one US official says. And even if the US did know all the locations, attacking Unit 450 "would be a pretty tricky affair because … if you attack them you may reduce the security of their weapons," a former Defense Intelligence Agency member says. For the same reason, the US won't share the location of stockpiles with the rebels. In other Syria news: John Kerry says his first day of talks with Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov was "constructive," the New York Times reports. The sides remain divided on whether the UN resolution should have a military component. Kerry argued for that military component forcefully in lengthy remarks yesterday. Lavrov seemed taken aback. "I'm not prepared with the extended political statement," he said. "Diplomacy likes silence." One thing has already come out of the talks: The sides agreed to hold peace talks later this month in New York in the hopes of ending the war diplomatically, CNN reports. Bashar al-Assad, meanwhile, is feeling emboldened enough to make demands. Yesterday he said he'd only relinquish his chemical weapons if the US "ceases arms deliveries to terrorists," meaning the rebels. Assad also suggested that the Russian plan could be used to drag things out. "It doesn't mean that Syria will sign the documents, fulfill the obligations, and that's it," he said.

Story: – Hillary Clinton sits down with People magazine for a cover story, and the one media outlet you think might let The Subject of Unending Speculation go, in fact does not. "I know I have a decision to make," she says of making a second run for the Oval Office. "But part of what I've been thinking about, is everything I'm interested in and everything I enjoy doing—and with the extra added joy of 'I'm about to become a grandmother,' I want to live in the moment." But "I am concerned about what I see happening in the country and in the world." More from her interview: On the Oval Office's glass ceiling: "I think it reflects a desire on the part of a lot of Americans, not just women, that we have unfinished business. I’m certainly in the camp that says we need to break down that highest, hardest glass ceiling in American politics. To have a woman president is something I would love to see happen, but I’ll just have to make my own decision about what I think is right for me." On how she and the hubs 'totally binge-watched' House of Cards: It was "a little bit of the, 'Oh, my gosh, I can't believe we can just sit here and do this' and, 'We're only going to watch one episode, oh, let's watch another. OK, well, we have time, we're not going anywhere, let's watch a third.' I know that sounds kind of devoid of content." Speaking of Bill: "People say that he’s too thin. He doesn’t think so, and he has an enormous amount of energy." Oh, and her hair: "I’m at an age where I can pretty much do what I want: 'Here I am, whether you like my hair or not.'" Not a walker: The Wall Street Journal has an image of the cover, and it points out that, contrary to some online buzz, Clinton is not leaning on a walker. It's just a chair.

Story: – Wondering how Amanda Bynes is doing these days? Answer: She still seems to be in the midst of some sort of breakdown. But we better be careful saying that, because Bynes is feeling sue-happy. She tweeted yesterday, "I'm suing @usweekly & @perezhilton for continuing to act like I'm doing something wrong by tweeting and walking to photoshoots. F--- you!!!!" She's upset at both gossip outlets for publishing pictures of her walking around Times Square with a shirt over her head, the New York Post explains. Perez Hilton worried she may be "mentally unstable," noting all her recent strange behavior (including a way too-much-information tweet about Drake, a "dilapidated" home, and cheek piercings). The Hollywood Reporter points out that the lawsuit tweet is far from her only recent weird rambling on the social networking site; she's also been discussing a new clothing and perfume line she's supposedly creating, which somehow explains the shirt-over-the-head incident, according to her. And then there are her not-so-inspirational quotes, like this one: "It doesn't matter what you think about yourself. All that matters is what your lover thinks of you."

Story: – At least one longtime Donald Trump ally wasn’t pleased with the president picking up an award in Saudi Arabia. That’s actually putting it mildly: "Candidly this makes me want to puke," tweeted Roger Stone after Trump was pictured receiving the Order of Abdulaziz, the nation's highest civilian honor. He used the hashtag "#JaredsIdea," suggesting that the decision to accept the award came from son-in-law Jared Kushner. Presidents Obama and George W. Bush had previously received the honor—Trump famously criticized Obama because he "bowed" to the Saudi king—and Stone is unhappy that Trump decided to accept it, too. "Instead of meeting with the Saudis," he wrote, Trump "should be demanding they pay for the attack on America on 9/11 which they financed." As CNN notes, the tweets come as Trump appears to be trying to distance himself from his one-time campaign adviser. After reports emerged that Stone was among those who advised Trump to fire FBI chief James Comey, the president responded on Twitter. "Have not spoken to Roger in a long time," he wrote. "Had nothing to do with my decision." Those interested in learning more about Stone should check out the new Netflix documentary, Get Me Roger Stone, writes Rick Jervis at USA Today. He'd heard of Stone before the film, "but I had little idea of the depth of his influence he's had on American politics the past five decades and on the current White House tenant."

Story: – The rumors of trouble in paradise for Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi keep on coming: The couple was supposed to attend a charity fundraiser Sunday but never showed up, and sources tell Page Six it's because they had "an epic fight" in the car on the way over. DeGeneres' and de Rossi's names and photos were on the invitation to the Saving SPOT! event in Santa Monica; they were listed as hosts. They tell Page Six, "We were happy to lend our names as honorary chairs and the organization was always aware that we would be unable to attend," adding that they never approved their photos to be included on the invitations. "The story is a complete lie," says a DeGeneres lawyer. "There was no fight." But sources tell a different story. "Ellen and Portia were delayed and were in the car on the way, when they had an epic fight. They ended up turning around and not going," says one source. They "were supposed to be at the event at 5pm, but at 6:30pm, the media was still waiting for their arrival. Reporters were told they were on their way, until the head of the charity informed everyone at the end of the event that they weren't going to make it due to 'logistics.'" DeGeneres last month slammed all the rumors swirling around her and her wife, noting on her talk show's season premiere, "I had a great summer. I went on a trip with Portia, my beautiful wife—who I am happily married to, but thank you for your heartfelt concern, tabloids." (Also last month, a source close to the couple insisted Ellen "puts Portia before anything.")

Story: – The Cut has finally gotten the full story behind what many consider the best comment ever left on a recipe article—or, maybe, any article at all. Behold, the comment, left two years ago by Sydne Newberry on the New York Times article relating Katharine Hepburn's brownie recipe: "This has been my go-to brownie recipe for 30 years. In the ’80s, an acquaintance in Germany to whom I brought some of the brownies, and who considered herself a great cook, asked for the recipe but was never able to get it to work. She kept asking me what she was doing wrong and I was never able to solve her problem. Eventually, she moved to the U.S. and stole my husband!" The comment is the Times' comment moderating team's all-time favorite, and has gone viral multiple times, most recently when an NYC Parks & Rec commissioner called Newberry the "greatest living short story writer." Newberry replied to his tweet, and The Cut decided to reach out to her for the full story. Turns out that Newberry and her then-husband were friends with the unnamed woman and her husband when Newberry's husband was on temporary Air Force duty in Germany; Newberry brought the brownies over once and the "gorgeous Italian woman" wanted the recipe, but could never make it work despite Newberry's attempts to help via mail; the woman even implied Newberry had purposely sabotaged the recipe. Years later, she visited the Newberrys in the US after her own marriage broke up, and started her affair with Newberry's husband. He ended up choosing her over Newberry and Newberry eventually married her current husband, the "love of her life," who loves the brownies. The full story is worth a read.

Story: – Federal health inspectors discovered listeria inside the packing facility of the Colorado farm that shipped out lethal cantaloupes, killing 25 people so far, reports USA Today. FDA officials also found several sanitation problems, including dirty and contaminated equipment that could explain how listeria spread to the fruit. For example, a truck that ferried waste cantaloupes to a cattle farm was parked near the open-air packing facility. Cow manure on the wheels could have infected the produce, say officials. Other violations at Jensen Farms included pools of water on the floor and a dirty potato-washing machine (for the cantaloupes) that could have introduced listeria into the facility. The farm bought the hard-to-clean washer in July, the same month the outbreak started, notes AP.

Story: – A set of viral videos showing an Asian man being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight over the weekend has prompted plenty of outrage in the US, but there's been overseas reaction, too—specifically in China, CNBC reports. A passenger who took one of the videos of the incident that's now circulating online told the AP that the still-unidentified man complained to a United manager he'd been "singled out because he's a Chinese man," and although it hasn't been verified that he is Chinese, those on China's Weibo social media site are giving him a virtual pat on the back for calling attention to discrimination against Asians. The incident turned into Weibo's number-one trending topic on Tuesday, and the AP reports that by later in the day, a video on Weibo of the man's removal from the plane had been viewed more than 210 million times. Many critics there took the airline to task for what they view as blatant bias, although one commenter, per CNBC, wrote: "Whether the passenger is Asian or not, this is abominable." Others called for more direct action. "No need to apologize or explain … please sue United Airlines till it collapses. Boycott fully," another commenter added. The AP notes a boycott by Chinese consumers could cause "serious pain," as United does a hefty amount of business in that country. Joe Wong, a Chinese-American comedian, also spoke up on Twitter, thanking the unnamed doctor for speaking up. "Too few Asians are willing to talk about discrimination," Wong tweeted. Meanwhile, United's shares were down 6% in premarket trading Tuesday, CNNMoney reports. (United's CEO says employees had "no choice" in having the man removed.)

Story: – Following the departure of most US forces from Afghanistan, clashes between its security forces and the Taliban have been renewed, with brutal fighting returning to areas that had been comparatively quiet, the New York Times reports. From June to November, some 1,300 members of Afghan security forces were killed in Helmand province alone, and a local hospital remained nearly full even after the customary fighting season ended. Many civilians have also been treated at the hospital, including 940 women and children through October. "This year is much worse than previous years," says a medical official. Indeed, over the course of the year, the country has seen some 5,000 security-force deaths, a record, the Times reports. Civilian deaths have also hit a record high, and total civilian casualties are poised to pass 10,000 for the year, Reuters reports. The UN says three-quarters of the 3,188 civilians killed through November were killed by insurgents, a figure the Taliban calls "biased and unfounded," Reuters notes. Meanwhile, the country has seen increased corruption and declines in government services since the US departed. "Our own commanders sell our bullets to the Taliban instead of giving them to us, and then they buy a nice house in Lashkar Gah and stay there, leaving the little guys out there to do the fighting," says a wounded police officer. But the Afghan forces are still "holding on," the Times notes, and an Afghan official says 151 Taliban members have been killed in 12 days of fighting near the Pakistani border, the AP reports.

Story: – An envelope addressed to the White House and apparently containing cyanide was caught by off-site screeners before it got anywhere near the president, the Secret Service says. A spokesman says the package initially tested negative for the poison after it was received at the White House Mail Screening Facility on Monday but it tested positive during chemical screening yesterday and a lab is working to confirm the results, CNN reports. Officials say that the person who opened the letter at the screening facility was not exposed. According to a law enforcement alert seen by the Intercept, the screening facility received an "envelope containing an unknown milky substance, in a container wrapped in a plastic bag." The alert says the return address belongs to a man who has been known to the Secret Service since 1995, when he sent a package covered in urine and feces to the White House. The person has sent other packages over the years, according to the alert, most recently "mini alcoholic beverages" in June 2012. (The Secret Service is seeking $8 million to build a fake White House.)

Story: – Most people would consider love letters, hairbrushes, and underwear to be "highly personal items"—and a New York state Supreme Court judge agreed that, in Madonna's case, those items shouldn't be put up for auction, the AP reports. On Tuesday, the pop star received the emergency court order she was seeking that stops (for now) auction house Gotta Have It! Collectibles from hawking 22 former material possessions of the Material Girl, including said brush (complete with strands of hair), panties she once wore, and a love note from rapper Tupac Shakur, whom she used to date. In court papers, Madonna noted she'd been "shocked to learn" the Tupac letter, which some anticipated would sell for up to $400,000, had been removed from her home (she fingers former friend Darlene Lutz, who used to stay at her house often, as the one who swiped her personal effects). Madonna also mentioned that by putting her hairbrush up for grabs, the auction house was also selling her DNA, a move she called "outrageous" and "grossly offensive." Also pulled from the "for sale" pile: vacation pictures, checkbooks, cassette tapes with never-before-released recordings, and a letter in which Madonna railed against Whitney Houston and Sharon Stone, calling them "horribly mediocre," per the Telegraph and Reuters. A rep for the auction house and Lutz says in an emailed statement that Madonna's claims are "baseless" and that they'll be fighting to reschedule the sale, which had originally been set for Wednesday.

Story: – Yosemite National Park is getting 400 more acres, its largest expansion since 1949. The Trust for Public Land bought the land, which was previously used for logging and cattle grazing and which lies along the park's western boundary, for $2.3 million, NPR reports. The trust, a conservation group whose purchase was supported by private donors and a number of other groups, then donated the land to Yosemite on Wednesday. Ranching will cease on the land in two years. The land is home to at least two endangered species and also includes Ackerson Meadow, which the trust describes as "a gentler landscape than the imposing granite cliffs of Yosemite Valley." Just 3% of Yosemite is meadow, Reuters reports. Yosemite, which totals around 750,000 acres, has had its eye on the land for decades, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. "It’s a really important acquisition," says a spokesperson for the park. "You’ve got the critical habitat for the birds and reptiles, and you’ve got the wetlands." The owners of the land tell the AP they declined a higher offer for the land that would have seen it turned into a resort.
Summary: 1. What is the location of the land that Yosemite National Park is expanding into?2. Who bought the land, and how much did they pay for it?3. What was the land previously used for?4. What endangered species can be found on the land?5. How big is Yosemite National Park currently, and how much of it is meadowland?6. How did the park know the land was important to acquire?7. Why did the landowners decline a higher offer for the land?8. What does the park spokesperson say about the acquisition?9.

Story: – Limited leg room is harder to bear when passengers know others are comfortably sipping bubbly nearby. That's the takeaway from a University of Toronto study that examined 1,500 "air rage" incidents from a single airline and found incidents rise on flights with a first-class cabin, particularly if economy passengers have to walk through the area to get to their seat. "When they close the curtains between the cabins or they remind economy passengers to not go into (the) forward cabin … it reminds people that they've paid hundreds of dollars for this experience" yet are still deprived of certain services and comforts, lead author Katherine DeCelles tells ABC News. "When people feel a sense of deprivation and inequality, they are more likely to act out," she adds, per CNN. Air rage incidents including emotional outbursts or aggressive behavior typically occur 1.58 times per 1,000 flights in economy class, reports the Los Angeles Times. But passengers were 3.84 times more likely to have an incident with a first-class cabin on board; a similar increase accompanied a 9.5-hour flight delay. Those passengers who had to travel through the first-class area while boarding were 2.18 times more likely to get angry, a rate that mimics the effects of a 15-hour delay, say researchers. The rate of incidents also spiked for first-class passengers when economy passengers tromped through their space, perhaps because they were "more aware of their higher status" and thus more likely "to have entitled attitudes and to be less compassionate," DeCelles says. One psychologist suggests passengers board planes in the middle to avoid first-class envy. (Just hope your pilot remembers how to fly.)
Summary: 1. What was the purpose of the University of Toronto study, and what did it examine?2. How did the study define "air rage" incidents, and what were the criteria used to identify them?3. What was the main finding of the study regarding the relationship between first-class cabins and air rage incidents?4. How did the study account for the potential impact of other factors that could contribute to air rage, such as flight duration, delay, or passenger characteristics?5. What was the role of perceived inequality and deprivation in the development of air rage incidents, according to the study?6. How did the study's findings on air rage incidents compare to previous research on the topic?7.

How might the study's findings be applied to other contexts where social status and privilege are involved, such as business meetings or social gatherings?9. What are some potential strategies that airlines could use to reduce the likelihood of air rage incidents, given the findings of the study?10. How might the study's findings be used to inform the development of interventions or strategies to reduce air rage incidents in general?
Story: – Remember earlier this year when Mitt Romney boasted of being a "severely conservative" governor? Well, he's long gone, and "moderate Mitt" is the one on a roll: David Weigel, Slate: "Here’s the odd thing" about that debate triumph: "He did it by being the Mitt Romney that conservatives always said they didn’t like. It was the first time in 10 years he’d had to debate a Democrat, not some conservative who could run to his right. So he snuck around the president and flanked him from the left." David Brooks, New York Times: Brooks loves the new "authentic" version of the candidate. "Romney did something no other mainstream Republican has had the guts to do. Either out of conviction or political desperation, he broke with Tea Party orthodoxy and began to redefine the Republican identity. And, having taken this step, he’s broken the spell. Conservatives loved it!" Peggy Noonan, Wall Street Journal: "He's supposed to be extreme, but he was not in the least extreme. He spent his time talking not just to Republicans or conservatives but to the American people, a huge and varied lot." Reid J. Epstein, Ginger Gibson, Politico: Romney "sounded at the first debate a lot like what conservatives always suspected he really is—a Massachusetts moderate who supports some regulations and doesn’t want to cut taxes for the rich. And the right wing loved it."

Story: – Michael Rogers, a hero? It's hard for him to believe. But many Australians are celebrating the man who helped police fight a knife-wielding terrorist in Melbourne, Australia's News Network reports. In fact, a crowdfunding campaign has raised nearly $110,000 as of this writing for the so-called "Trolleyman." On Friday, Rogers grabbed a shopping cart (or "trolley" in British English) when terrorist Hassan Khalif Shire Ali was facing cops on a busy commercial street. Ali had just fatally stabbed two people and wounded two others. "I threw the trolley straight at him, and I got him," says Rogers. "I didn’t quite get him down, though. I'm no hero." Yet after falling, Rogers chased Ali across the street and pushed the cart at him again. Police eventually shot and killed the attacker. (See a video here, but be warned it's violent.) Now the media is lionizing Rogers and strangers are approaching him for selfies, the Age reports. But Rogers still seems himself, talking about his early years with a drug-addicted mom and his history of drug use and jail time. Raised partly by his grandma, the "dearest lady," he often disappointed her and was behind bars for aggravated burglary when she died in 2013. "She would have been exceptionally proud" of his actions, he says. "God bless her, she lived to 92." So how will he spend his newfound riches? Rogers, who has public housing but chooses to live on the streets, says he has no idea. "I'm 46, mate. I've got to get my act together." But he admits Friday was special: "I just wanted to help and do something right for the first time in me life." (In California, a sergeant at a mass shooting "died a hero.")

Story: – It's not surprising that, in a tense election year, politics and other weighty topics made a prominent appearance at this year's awards, per the AP. How they were broached, with both seriousness and a touch of levity: First, the explicit shout-outs to Election 2016: Jeb (with an exclamation point) Bush made a cameo in host Jimmy Kimmel's opening comedy segment as an Uber driver, SNL's Kate McKinnon thanked Hillary Clinton in her acceptance speech, and Kimmel blamed TV producer Mark Burnett for making Donald Trump a TV star. Meanwhile, Julia Louis-Dreyfus apologized for the current political climate. The subject of diversity also emerged, starting with Kimmel's slam against the Oscars. "The Emmys are so diverse this year that the Oscars are now telling everyone we're one of their closest friends," he noted, per Glamour, snarkily adding, "We're not." Alan Yang, who won an Emmy for comedy series writing with Aziz Ansari, noted he hoped there would be more and better roles for Asian actors, per Vulture, while People notes that Transparent star Jeffrey Tambor, in his seventh consecutive Emmy win, made his own plea to the powers-that-be in the industry: "Please give transgender talent a chance." Jill Soloway, for her part, combined diversity and politics. Soloway, who won the best director award for the comedy Transparent, talked about how directing is a "privilege" and how important it is to cast "women, people of color, trans people, [and] queer people," per EW.com. "Topple the patriarchy!" were her parting words. But it was her backstage comments that caught the attention of the Hollywood Reporter, which noted Soloway turned to the topic of Donald Trump and how she thinks he's "otherizing people" and is a "complete dangerous monster." Leslie Jones spiced up what's usually the most boring moment of the awards show: the salute to Ernst & Young's accountants. "Since you good at keeping things safe, I got a job for you—my Twitter account," Jones told the company's trio of reps, per the AP, referring to the recent abuse and harassment she's dealt with online. "Put that in the vault, please." Check out all of the night's winners.

Story: – We all know the frustration of spending heavily on a gadget only to see it become obsolete within what seems like minutes. And you might want to keep that in mind with the arrival of the Apple Watch this month, writes Christopher Mims in the Wall Street Journal. "Anyone who isn’t a self-described early adopter might want to avoid the entire category of wearables, at least for a few more years," Mims notes. That's because the products' development is set to "evolve at a breathtaking pace over the next two to five years." Right now, there are all kinds of different smartwatches, all focusing on different answers to the question: "Which parts of a smartphone does it make sense to put on a person’s wrist?” Mims notes. The market will help decide what works. Meanwhile, the watches, which, as it stands, mostly depend on pairing with smartphones, are likely to become more workable as independent devices. But if you are one of those who has to have the Apple Watch as soon as possible, you'll need to take action soon, CNET reports. Sales require online reservations, at least for now: You won't be able to just hurry into an Apple Store the day it comes out. (And you might want to think twice about which model you buy.)

Story: – The Biebs recently said he wants to be a dad, and that might already be the case. A woman who boasts of a backstage quickie with Justin Bieber has filed a paternity suit against the singer. Californian Mariah Yeater, 20, claims that she and Bieber, then a jailbait 16, had sex at the LA Staples Center after one of his concerts a year ago when she was 19. It was a "brief" coupling, Bieber's first time, and he refused to wear a condom, Yeater said in an affidavit. She now has a three-month-old baby boy, and is asking a court to order Bieber to take a paternity test and financially support her son, reports the New York Post. Bieber's legal team is attacking the claim. "While we haven't yet seen the lawsuit, it's sad that someone would fabricate malicious, defamatory, and demonstrably false claims," a representative told TMZ.

Story: – George and Cindy Anthony received death threats after daughter Casey's surprise acquittal yesterday, and subsequently have gone into hiding, Radar reports. Their attorney, Mark Lippman, said the Internet-based threats are under investigation. In a statement, the Anthonys said yesterday that the family "may never know what happened to Caylee Marie Anthony," but that "the jury made a fair decision." They also decried Casey's defense—that her father sexually molested her as a child and then helped to cover up her own daughter's accidental death—as "baseless." Lippman also noted in an appearance on Good Morning America that the Anthonys were "shocked" at the acquittal since prosecutors "did a fantastic job," but he wouldn't say whether they think their daughter is guilty. They were hoping to get "some sliver of truth" from Casey during the trial, he added, but she did not testify. What happens now? According to Radar, Lippman says it's too early to know if Casey will be welcomed back into the family fold. The Anthonys have not talked to their daughter since before her trial began, the AP notes.

Story: – Wednesday marked the third day in a row in which President Trump publicly attacked Jeff Sessions, who was once one of his closest allies, Politico reports. In a series of tweets, the president criticized his attorney general for not replacing Andrew McCabe as acting FBI director, calling McCabe "a Comey friend who was in charge of Clinton investigation but got big dollars ($700,000) for his wife's political run from Hillary Clinton." PolitiFact has called these claims "mostly false." Jill McCabe got a donation from a PAC associated with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a friend of the Clintons; Andrew McCabe was made deputy FBI director months after his wife's campaign ended; and Trump himself can designate numerous officials as acting FBI director without Sessions being involved. While Trump and Sessions are reportedly not on speaking terms—ABC News notes Sessions was at the White House for a meeting Wednesday, but Trump was not expected to attend—their relationship may be about to improve. CNN reports Trump has recently criticized Sessions for not being "tougher on the leaks." Now, Sessions is reportedly set to make an announcement in the next week that he is stepping up his investigation into ongoing intelligence leaks. The Trump-Sessions feud started last week when Trump implied he regretted appointing Sessions over his recusal in the Russia investigation. On Tuesday, Trump said "time will tell" if Sessions resigns. But on Wednesday, Sessions' chief of staff reportedly told the White House that Sessions isn't going anywhere.

Story: – Despite numerous calls for him to do so, Rep. John Conyers won't resign—but he is retiring, and it looks like he's not waiting. "I'm in the process of putting my retirement plans together," he told Detroit radio host Mildred Gaddis in a call from a hospital Tuesday, per the AP. Although the news agency says it's not clear when the retirement takes effect, Conyers said, "I am retiring today." Per the New York Times, Conyers says he endorses his son, John Conyers III, to take his seat in Congress. But Michigan state Sen. Ian Conyers, who's the 29-year-old grandson of Conyers' brother, says he also plans to run for his 88-year-old great-uncle's Detroit seat. "His doctor advised him that the rigor of another campaign would be too much for him just in terms of his health," Ian Conyers notes. It's not likely to appease the elder Conyers' critics or the women who accuse him of sexual harassment in the workplace. Another woman joined the fray Monday, claiming Conyers put his hand up her skirt and rubbed her thighs while in the front row of a church, per the AP. "I was startled and sprang to my feet and exclaimed, 'He just ran his hand up my thigh!' Other staffers witnessed the event," Elisa Grubbs says in an affidavit, also alleging that Conyers appeared naked in front of her. Grubbs—who is the cousin of fellow Conyers accuser Marion Brown—reportedly worked for Conyers from 2001 to 2013. It isn't clear when the alleged behavior took place. Conyers' lawyer has referred to Grubbs' claims as "another instance of tomfoolery from the mouth of Harvey Weinstein's attorney." Grubbs is represented by Lisa Bloom, who represented Weinstein before he faced allegations of sexual misconduct.

Story: – One of the consequences of losing a presidential election in the age of Facebook: You lose a lot of "likes," too. Mitt Romney has been getting "unliked" on Facebook at quite a quick clip, CNN reports. When the Washington Post took a look at his Facebook page Friday, he was losing 593 likes per hour. By Saturday, Mashable noted that it was up to 847 unlikes an hour. As of this morning, Romney was hemorrhaging about 11 likes per minute, according to CNN. (To watch Romney lose Facebook friends in real time, check out DisappearingRomney.com.) Of course, the former presidential contender still has more than 12 million fans on Facebook and more than 1.7 million Twitter followers—and it's not like he's been doing much to retain his fan base, having posted just one message since losing the election.

Story: – Leo Sharp turned 90 yesterday ... while sitting in federal court in Detroit, where he was sentenced to three years in federal prison for his role in a drug smuggling operation. The Indiana man, a World War II veteran, was convicted of hauling cocaine between Mexico and Detroit for a Mexican drug cartel; he was arrested in 2011 near Ann Arbor, where he was found with almost $3 million worth of cocaine in his pickup during a traffic stop, the Detroit Free Press reports. In court yesterday, Sharp said he's "heartbroken" about his crime, and threatened suicide: "I won’t live in prison, I’m just going to end my life if I end up there." His lawyer pleaded with the judge to reconsider the sentence, arguing that Sharp suffers from dementia and the condition caused him to use "bad judgment," the AP reports. He also spoke at length about Sharp's military service, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star ("before we were even born, he was on top of mountains fighting Nazis," the lawyer asserted). But the judge would not relent, noting that the dementia argument was an "insult to all the people who have dementia and don't get involved in illegal activity." She added that she'd basically be sending a message to drug dealers that "if you want to inoculate your organization from punishment ... get an elderly person to do your deliveries for you." Sharp, who the government says was paid more than $1 million by the cartel, agreed to pay the government $500,000 and give up property in Florida; his prison date has not yet been set.

Story: – Following last night’s victory over Nicolas Sarkozy, Francois Hollande will have to jump right in to his new role—he will be sworn in as France’s president next Tuesday, the BBC notes. What does his election mean? Hollande has vowed to renegotiate the eurozone budget treaty Sarkozy championed along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, but the German government today is trying to cut that off at the pass, calling it “not possible.” Though Hollande's election has fueled hope among many French hungry for jobs, economic growth, and the end of austerity, he faces the same debt problems Sarkozy did. Der Spiegel notes that Hollande knows just how tough is the job ahead of him: Rather than appearing celebratory last night, the unsmiling victor “seemed tired, weak, and overwhelmed,” the paper reports. One of his largest tasks will be to forge a relationship with Merkel, whose ideas about austerity he has railed against. He could meet with her as soon as the very day of his inauguration. From there, his schedule is packed: the G-8 summit, the NATO summit, campaigning for June’s parliamentary elections and, if the Socialists win a majority, choosing a prime minister. This could be one of the most significant shifts in Europe since the economic crisis began, the New York Times notes, but the analysts expect the markets to give France a “grace period” to see if Hollande can increase investor confidence. The AP looks back on Sarkozy’s unconventional presidency, charting his downfall since his first day in 2007 when he jogged up the steps of the presidential palace in shorts. Ultimately, he came to be seen as self-centered and too showy—not to mention unable to deliver on his campaign promises. Many are cheering his defeat, al-Jazeera reports from Bastille Square, where throngs celebrated by chanting, “Sarkozy, it’s over.”

Story: – It's like Mike Tyson all over again. After a pair of Los Angeles Dodgers prospects got in a fight, one ended up with part of his ear bitten off. There's still hope, however, for infielder Alex Guerrero and his ear: He's set to have plastic surgery to reattach it, the Los Angeles Times reports, per Guerrero's agent. The fight occurred during a game between the Dodgers-affiliated Albuquerque Isotopes and the Salt Lake Bees, the BBC reports. Catcher Miguel Olivo was apparently fuming after what he saw as a bad play by Guerrero. In the dugout, "Olivo decked him," Guerrero's agent tells the Times. Teammates pulled them apart, at which point the chunk of Guerrero's ear was in Olivo's mouth. Olivo could face criminal charges; Guerrero hasn't decided whether to take legal action, police say. Insiders tell ESPN Guerrero may be out for five weeks. He and Olivo have both played for the Dodgers in the big leagues this season.

Story: – Texas Gov. Rick Perry smiled for his police mugshot and promised to be vindicated on abuse-of-power charges today. Perry turned himself in at the Travis County Courthouse in Austin on the felony accusations, reports Reuters. “I'm here today because I believe in the rule of law," he said before entering the courthouse to be booked, reports the San Antonio Express-News. "I'm here today because I did the right thing. I'm going to enter this courthouse with my head held high knowing that the actions that I took were not only lawful and legal but right." The governor's case stems from allegations that he tried to intimidate a Democratic district attorney into resigning after she was charged with drunken driving. When she refused to do so, he made good on a threat to veto funds for the public corruption unit she was running. For the record, Perry is charged with one count of abuse of official capacity and one count of coercion of a public servant. The first is a felony punishable by five to 99 years in prison and the second is a lesser felony punishable by two to 10 years. (As for the mugshot, he apparently heard experts' advice to ditch the glasses.)

Story: – A CNN analyst is calling it an "extraordinary video"; Washington Post reporter Greg Miller calls it a "brazen" scene: a lengthy clip of what appears to be the largest meeting of al-Qaeda members in years, an open-air gathering of some 100 militants somewhere in Yemen. The video (an untranslated version appears on YouTube) was recently posted to militant websites and was covered by CNN yesterday. What US officials would say: The video does seem to be recent and authentic, and it's being carefully reviewed. What they won't say: If they knew the meeting—which al-Qaeda's No. 2 attended—was taking place, or if the video is what tipped them off. That honcho, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader Nasser al-Wuhayshi, shows his face in the video and "looks unconcerned" about the possibility of a US drone hitting the meeting, notes CNN. He urges attacks against America. "We must eliminate the cross," he said, and "the bearer of the cross is America." Other faces, however, were digitally obscured; the Post suggests this may because those faces belong to Western recruits. It further sees Wuhayshi's prominence in the video as a move that could be designed to expand his following and cement his position as Ayman al-Zawahiri's successor. (Reports say Wuhayshi was groomed by Osama bin Laden himself.)

Story: – That's it for Canada's penny: Today is the last day the coin will be distributed after minting stopped in May as a cost-saving measure. Still, there are 6 billion pennies in circulation, so they could be around for a long time: "We estimate three to four years" as they are pulled from circulation, says a Royal Canadian Mint rep. For cash shoppers, that means prices will be rounded up or down to the nearest nickel; for those paying by card, prices won't change, the Province reports. Consumers can drop pennies off at their local banks, donate them to charities, or use them at stores' discretion, the Globe and Mail notes. Just 52.9% of Canada's Retail Council members are ready for the shift, the council found. Some 81.5% think it'll cost them no more than $5,000. As for consumers, "the net impact ... is that it balances out," says an analyst. The Wall Street Journal reflects on more than 150 years of Canadian pennies: The first was minted in 1858. Since 1908, 35 billion have been minted—enough to circle the Earth 16 times. A 1936 one-cent coin known as the Dot is worth a lot more than a cent: One recently sold for $402,500. On a separate note, today's Canadian Google doodle features a penny, the Global News reports.

Story: – In Florida, a person must be missing for five years before a "letter of presumed death" can be issued. But in a new twist, documents reveal that Lewis Bennett requested such a letter just four days after his new wife, Isabella Hellmann, went missing and the day after the Coast Guard called off its search, reports ABC News. The couple from Delray Beach, Fla., had married three months earlier and were celebrating their marriage by sailing the Caribbean. Bennett reported their boat capsized on May 15. He says he'd been sleeping below the night of the 14th when he awoke to the sound of the boat hitting something and found the boat was taking on water; when he couldn't find his 41-year-old wife, he says he jumped into a life raft and sent out a distress call. The Coast Guard found Bennett on the 15th, and called off the search for Hellmann on the 18th—after spending 138 hours searching nearly 5,000 square nautical miles. The Coast Guard and FBI list it as a missing person's case with no mention of foul play, but Hellmann's sister, Adriana Difeo, has been vocal about suspecting otherwise. Difeo tried to become Hellmann's conservator to protect the couple's Delray Beach condo and pay off her debts, but has no standing given that Hellmann had no will. Bennett, as Hellmann's husband and father of their 9-month-old daughter, is the only person with standing, reports the Palm Beach Post. Bennett has since taken his daughter to the UK to "seek the comfort" of friends and family, according to a Facebook account he since deleted. (One lost-at-sea case has taken a turn.)

Story: – The Interior Department was ordered to stop tweeting from all its official accounts Friday after two posts from the National Park Service that seemed to criticize the new administration. One tweet illustrated the big difference in turnout between President Obama's 2009 inauguration and Friday's more lightly attended event with photos from the top of the Washington Monument, the Hill reports. The other retweet contained a link to an article about the White House website removing pages about climate change and civil rights, among other things. The tweets were removed from the NPS account later in the day. National Park employees and all Interior Department bureaus were told there was an "urgent directive" to "immediately cease use of government Twitter accounts until further notice," according to an email obtained by Gizmodo. Parks "that use Twitter as part of their crisis communications plans need to alter their contingency plans to accommodate this requirement," the email stated. The department's dozens of Twitter accounts include those of the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the US Geological Survey, the Washington Post notes. According to the email, the department expects "further guidance" next week.

Story: – Missed Heidi Montag's first Playboy spread? Fear not: Soon you'll have another chance to gaze upon the reality show star—and her new DDD breasts. Montag is planning a second appearance in the skin mag because she "loves her new body" and is "finally ready to pose topless," a source tells In Touch—but perhaps the most compelling reason is the $500,000 paycheck. "She could use the money," explains the friend. MSNBC reports the deal could actually hit seven figures, which would probably help Montag in the wake of her abysmal album sales. The recently renovated plastic surgery addict is planning a "steamy, soapy, shower concept showing her boobs through the shower door," says another source.

Story: – An intern at a Washington, DC, think tank was just supposed to monitor its Twitter account, not tell Amnesty International to "suck it." The human rights organization was making a point about the uproar in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting death of Michael Brown, tweeting yesterday: "US can’t tell other countries to improve their records on policing and peaceful assembly if it won’t clean up its own human rights record," reports Talking Points Memo. Unfortunately, a Center for Strategic and International Studies intern thought he was using his own account when he expressed this opinion: "Your work has saved far fewer lives than American interventions. So suck it." That hasn't gone over well with CSIS senior VP Andrew Schwartz, who quickly blamed the intern and called the comment "abhorrent" and "unconscionable." Schwartz has already started cleaning up the mess, sending an apologetic email and tweet to Amnesty explaining the error and insisting that "the tweet in no way reflects CSIS's views." When asked if the intern would be fired, Schwartz told BuzzFeed he will "address the matter internally." The tweet was quickly deleted, but not before one user captured this screenshot.

Story: – Sen. Elizabeth Warren has released a DNA test that shows "strong evidence" of at least some Native American ancestry—but the Cherokee Nation is not impressed. Cherokee Nation Secretary of State Chuck Hoskins Jr. said in a statement Monday that a DNA test is "not evidence for tribal affiliation," Time reports. "Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong," Hoskins said. The Oklahoman calls the statement a "rare rebuke" to Warren from the tribe, whose chief, Bill Baker, is a fellow Democrat. Warren has said family lore tells of connections to the Cherokee and Delaware tribes. The test found that her DNA is mostly European, but there is evidence of a Native American ancestor six to 10 generations ago. In a tweet Monday, Warren said she took the test because she won't "sit quietly" for the "racism" of President Trump, "but DNA & family history has nothing to do with tribal affiliation or citizenship, which is determined only – only – by Tribal Nations. I respect the distinction, & don't list myself as Native in the Senate." She went on to slam Trump in more than a dozen tweets, calling him a "cowardly elitist." She reminded Trump on Monday of his promise to pay $1 million to charity if she took a DNA test, but he made it clear he had no intention of paying up. He told reporters he would "only do it if I can test her personally," and added it "will not be something I enjoy doing, either." (Warren has said she will consider challenging Trump in 2020 after the midterm elections.)

Story: – The annual Ig Nobel prizes for odd research were handed out last night and the winning scientists were as weird as ever. Among the winners were a Japanese team that determined the ideal level of airborne wasabi to awaken sleepers (for a potential fire alarm), a Norwegian who tried to understand why people sigh, and Australian researchers who discovered that a certain species of beetle often attempts to mate with empty beer bottles, the Globe and Mail reports. Real Nobel winners handed out the prizes at the ceremony at Harvard. The prize for public safety went to a Canadian who studied how well somebody could drive on a highway while wearing a helmet with a visor that repeatedly flapped over his face. The mayor of Vilnius won the peace prize for using a tank to crush cars parked in a bike lane. The mathematics prize went to six people—including rapture prophet Harold Camping—whose predictions of the end of the world turned out to be incorrect. The citation thanked the doomsday prophets "for teaching the world to be careful when making mathematical assumptions." Scientific American has the full list.

Story: – The first woman has come forward to detail the alleged sexual harassment she says she suffered at the hands of San Diego mayor Bob Filner, whom she is suing, NBC San Diego reports. "The past six months turned out to be the worst time of my entire working life," said Irene McCormack Jackson yesterday; she served as Filner's communication director before she resigned over the working conditions. Among her accusations: Filner asked her to work sans underwear; he expressed a desire to see her nude; he said—despite the fact that they only had a professional relationship—that he was excited to consummate their relationship; he put her into one of his famous headlocks; he made an inappropriate comment about handcuffs. "He thought it was acceptable behavior to regularly make sexual comments that were crude and disgusting," and he treated women like "sexual objects or stupid idiots," she said. She also claimed she saw Filner "place his hands where they did not belong on numerous women," the AP reports. Jackson, who resigned last month, filed a lawsuit against Filner yesterday, according to her attorney—none other than Gloria Allred, Politico reports. Filner responded to the suit with a statement saying he's "saddened" by the accusations, but does "not believe these claims are valid" and knows "justice will prevail." In her lawsuit, Jackson also claims three other female staffers "had to be driven home because of his abusive treatment," and five people ultimately resigned over his behavior.

Story: – A long-awaited grand jury report examining clergy sex abuse in Pennsylvania was released Tuesday, and it lists more than 300 "predator priests" accused of abusing more than 1,000 child victims over a period of seven decades. The almost 900-page report also has harsh words for Roman Catholic Church leadership, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer: "Priests were raping little boys and girls and the men of God who were responsible not only did nothing: They hid it all," it says. Dozens of church superiors are accused of being complicit, including some who have become prominent nationally, like Cardinal Donald Wuerl, one of Pope Francis' top US advisers. Wuerl released a statement denying being involved in any cover-up and insisting he "acted with diligence ... to prevent future acts of abuse." Some of the accounts included in the report are shocking, including one describing four priests who allegedly used whips and forced one victim to pose, naked, as Christ on the cross. Other accusations include a priest accused of raping and impregnating a teen, then helping her get an abortion; a priest accused of sexually abusing five sisters, including one who was abused from the age of 18 months to 12 years; a priest accused of keeping pubic hairs from his alleged victims; a victim who was forced to perform oral sex and then had his mouth washed out with holy water; and a victim who was forced to say confession to his alleged abuser.

Story: – Seattle is nudging its residents toward more careful waste disposal: Put too much food waste in your regular trash, and you could owe the city $1, according to a new rule unanimously approved by the city council. If garbage collectors notice, at a glance, that more than 10% of a home's trash could have been composted, residents could get a ticket on their bins warning of a fine the next time their trash is collected. Collectors will record tickets on an existing computer in their vehicles, the Seattle Times reports. Apartment buildings and businesses will also have random dumpster checks; they'll receive two warnings, then a $50 fine on the third offense. Though the fines will become an option in July—after tickets begin in January—officials doubt they'll be fining many people. "The point isn't to raise revenue,” says the city's solid-waste director. “We care more about reminding people to separate their materials." Seattle is now the second US city to require composting, after San Francisco, the BBC reports. The Natural Resources Defense Council says up to 40% of US food goes to waste, while the EPA notes that just 5% of scraps go to compost. (One "zero-waste" restaurant is trying to do something about it.)

What are some potential challenges or obstacles that residents may face in implementing the new rule, and how can the city address these challenges?
Story: – India has dealt with a series of high-profile rape cases, and the latest is a particularly thorny one: It involves a 10-year-old who is now pregnant. The New York Times reports the child is more than 20 weeks along after being "repeatedly raped by her stepfather over a period of time," per police. Last Wednesday, the girl's mother phoned a tip line for help. But after experiencing trauma so severe one of the doctors who examined her found the girl "not able to speak properly," she faced a second hurdle: obtaining permission to abort. The Hindustan Times reports that under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, abortion is only permitted after the 20-week mark in cases where the mother's life is endangered. The act was established to tamp down on the aborting of female fetuses in the country. The medical board that examined the girl determined "both the situations—abortion at present and delivery—could be equally dangerous" for the child, who lives in the Rohtak district in Haryana state, so they pushed the decision-making onto a court. The local court on Tuesday OK'd the abortion, reports the BBC, and the procedure will take place "anytime now." As far as child sexual abuse goes, India is a hotbed of it: About 13 children under the age of 10 are raped there each week, with the BBC citing a government study that found slightly more than 50% of children surveyed had experienced some type of sex abuse. The girl's stepfather, who is said to be in his 20s, has been arrested. Two other grisly rapes were reported in the country in the last week.

What is the broader context of child sexual abuse in India, and how does the country's culture and societal attitudes contribute to this problem?6. How does the arrest of the girl's stepfather fit into the larger picture of addressing and preventing child sexual abuse in India?7. What are the implications of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act for women's reproductive rights in India, and how does it relate to the broader issue of gender inequality in the country?8. How does the international community and organizations such as the United Nations support India in addressing the issue of child sexual abuse and ensuring access to safe and legal abortion?9. What are some potential solutions to address the root causes of child sexual abuse in India, such as societal attitudes and cultural norms that perpetuate this problem?10. How can the media and civil society organizations in India play a role in raising awareness and advocating for policies and practices that protect children from sexual abuse and ensure their access to safe and legal abortion?
Story: – Democrats are outraged over an interview Newt Gingrich gave the National Review this weekend, in which he offered what he called a “stunning insight” into President Obama’s mind. “What if [Obama] is so outside our comprehension, that only if you understand Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior, can you begin to piece together [his actions]?” Gingrich asked, saying Obama had “played a wonderful con” to trick America into thinking he “was normal, reasonable, moderate, bipartisan.” The DNC lashed out at Gingrich. “He’s not a reasonable man that some thought he could be,” a spokesman told the New York Times. “He’s proven he’s just like the rest of them.” The White House, meanwhile, offered a measured response. “I don’t even have—quite frankly—the slightest idea what he was talking about,” said Robert Gibbs, saying he suspected Gingrich was "trying to appeal to the fringe."

Story: – Seven has turned out to be a very unlucky number for Montreal man Joel Ifergan: He missed a $10.5 million prize in Canada's Super 7 lottery by seven seconds, and after almost seven years of fighting lottery authorities, his case has been rejected by the country's top court. Ifergan says that in May 2008, he bought two tickets at 8:59pm, a minute before the 9pm cutoff, the CBC reports. The first ticket out of the convenience store's machine was for that night's draw but the next one—which had the draw's winning numbers—was printed at seven seconds after 9pm and was registered for the following week's draw. If the ticket had been printed a few seconds earlier, he would have shared a $21 million jackpot with another winner. Ifergan sued lottery authorities in Quebec, saying the processing lag was the fault of their slow system. Loto-Quebec never disputed "the fact that my request for the two tickets was in their system at 8:59.47," he tells CTV, saying that "had those tickets been bought anywhere else in Canada, I would have been a millionaire seven years ago." But the courts in Quebec ruled against him, and the Supreme Court of Canada refused to hear his appeal yesterday. Ifergan, who says the case "consumed him" for seven years and cost him more than $100,000 in legal fees, says he has done all he can and will stop fighting the decision—but he hasn't stopped buying lottery tickets. (A Washington woman who went to the store for pumpkin spice picked up a ticket that won $90 million as well.)

Story: – A Louisiana man being questioned by police in the sexual assault of two juveniles at one point said the following, per a police transcript: "I know that I didn't do it so why don't you just give me a lawyer dog cause this is not what's up." As Elie Mystal writes at Above the Law, it seems obvious that the transcript should more accurately read, "I know that I didn't do it so why don't you just give me a lawyer, dawg, cause this is not what's up." But the Louisiana Supreme Court disagrees and has rejected Warren Demesme's claim that police rejected his right to counsel, reports the Times-Picayune of New Orleans. And its decision hinged on that all-important distinction between "dog" and "dawg," and the lack of a comma in the transcript. "In my view, the defendant's ambiguous and equivocal reference to a 'lawyer dog' does not constitute an invocation of counsel that warrants termination of the interview," writes Justice Scott Crichton. That is, the court ruled that because Demesme seemed to ask for a "lawyer dog," it was unclear that he wanted an actual lawyer, and so all his statements are fair game. The ruling doesn't take into account the possibility that the police transcript of Demesme's statement was off the mark. The 24-year-old is awaiting trial on charges of first-degree rape and indecent behavior with a juvenile under 13, and he faces a mandatory life sentence if convicted on the rape charge.

Story: – After its latest round of funding, ride-sharing service Uber has been valued at $17 billion. That's certainly gotten plenty of pens wagging, with some arguing that rather than being the world's most valuable tech start-up, Uber is problem-dogged, the scourge of cabbies, and insignificant. In Farhad Manjoo's view, it's anything but the latter. He sees it as potentially being to transportation what Amazon has been to shopping: something that could reshape the space, and to the extreme. "It has the potential to decrease private car ownership," argues Manjoo in the New York Times. He explains that in markets such as San Francisco, where Uber has a strong foothold, using the service daily is "already arguably cheaper than owning a private car," and competition among it and similar services will serve to drive prices down even more. Studies have found that taxi services actually prod people to use more public transportation, as having varied means to get one's self around leads people to consider ditching a car. One problem, per one study, is that regulation caps the number of taxis in most cities. Uber essentially sidesteps those regulations while, bonus, using technology to "smartly" centralize cars where demand is high and making the payment process effortless. All this could have a wide-reaching effect for urbanites: More Uber could ultimately mean a lower cost of living, less pollution, and a reduced need for so much parking. And in Manjoo's view, "It wouldn't be a stretch to see many small and midsize cities become transportation nirvanas on the order of Manhattan—places where forgoing car ownership isn’t just an outré lifestyle choice, but the preferred way to live."

Story: – Congratulations, Viatcheslav Ekimov of Russia. It looks like you've won the gold medal in cycling at the 2004 Olympics. The US cyclist originally awarded the medal, Tyler Hamilton, surrendered it last week and has admitted to doping, reports Bloomberg. Hamilton also is making headlines by accusing former Tour de France teammate Lance Armstrong of doping as well. Armstrong, who previously had been accused by teammate Floyd Landis, continues to deny the allegations. If he's proven to be a liar, it's more than just a matter of handing in old trophies, notes the New York Times. Under a case now being investigated by a federal grand jury, he could face charges of fraud, money laundering, corruption, and drug trafficking.

Story: – When Bex Baxter started seeing women in her office "bent over double" with pain—not from indigestion or appendicitis, but from their monthly menstrual cycles—she knew she had to act, per the Guardian. So the director of Coexist, based in Bristol, England, has decided to implement a "period policy" that will allow her female employees (all but seven of the 31 who work there) to take time off for menstrual pain. "They feel guilty and ashamed for taking time off and often sit at their desks in silence not wanting to acknowledge it," she says, per the Independent. The specifics of the policy haven't yet been drafted; Baxter and her team intend to do so during a March 15 seminar. Apparently there are many women suffering like this: The NIH's Medline Plus reports period pain "is the leading cause of lost time from school and work among women in their teens and 20s." The concept of menstrual leave isn't new: Fox News points out that Japan has had it since right after WWII, and other Asian countries, including a Chinese province, have followed suit; Nike was one of the first global companies to have a menstrual leave policy. But a professional living in Shanghai writes for the Global Times that there's often fear on women's part that they'll fall behind at work and risk annoying the boss by taking time off. Baxter refutes the idea that taking time off is unproductive. "The spring section of the cycle, immediately after a period, is a time when women are actually three times as productive as usual."

Story: – On May 9, Michalene Melges rented a van in Lake Bluff, Ill., more than 40 miles away from her home in Lake Geneva, Wis. She called her sons' school and asked for the boys to be excused for a vacation May 10 to 13. And then they vanished, with the rental van being returned in Plano, Tex., on May 13 without anyone apparently seeing the family. But, the Chicago Tribune reports, all four have now been found safe in Georgia. They were spotted by someone who recognized them from news reports, but it remains a mystery where they have been or what they have been doing for the past two weeks, Fox News reports. Melges, 40, is a well-known real estate agent in Lake Geneva. She finalized a divorce from the father of her sons—Hans, 14, Kristian, 12, and Maverik, 10—earlier this year, and by disappearing, she violated child custody rules because the boys missed several visitations with their dad. Melges and her ex had no history of police calls at their home, but in April, she did ask police for "an extra watch at her home," per a Lake Geneva police rep. The FBI and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children helped local police with the search.

Story: – In yet another example of the dangers of beach umbrellas, a woman was pierced in the chest by one in Ocean City, Md., on Sunday afternoon. Police say someone left a rental umbrella unattended without returning it to the stand, and the wooden pole ended up piercing the skin of a 46-year-old woman from Pennsylvania after the wind swept the umbrella away, WBOC reports. First responders cut it but didn't remove it completely out of concern they might cause more damage; the woman was flown to a hospital.

Story: – One of the best-reviewed movies of the last 12 months is an epic story about ... LEGO people? Believe it or not, The LEGO Movie is getting virtually unanimous critical praise—as of this writing it's at 99% on Rotten Tomatoes, with just one Top Critic offering a negative review. Here's what critics are saying about their improbable darling: "My fingers rebel, but type it I must: The LEGO Movie is the first great cinematic experience of 2014," writes Ty Burr at the Boston Globe. "The keys to the movie's absurdly high enjoyment factor are its exuberance, timing, wit, and willingness to stoop to its source"—unlike, say, Transformers or Battleship, this is "rooted in the wonky hobbyist esthetic of the LEGO system itself." "I’m going to level with you: I went in hoping at best for something intermittently amusing," admits Dana Stevens at Slate. Instead she got a symphony of "precisely orchestrated silliness," that's at times even kind of subversive and profound. Thanks in part to a "perception-shifting" third-act twist, the movie "really sets itself apart, not just from most branded entertainment, but from most films for children, period." "It may be a helter-skelter kiddie adventure built out of plastic toy components," writes Owen Gleiberman at EW, but it's also "conceptually audacious," "visually astonishing," and "startlingly sophisticated." Like Toy Story before it, the movie "invents a kind of child-friendly meta universe" in which "the transparently fake Lego constructions embody the pure spirit of make-believe." Andrew O'Hehir at Salon also took "wonder and delight" in the movie, which "could easily have been test-marketed, corporate-processed crap." But he can't help over-analyzing the fact that this fable about rejecting the stifling strictures of "Lord Business" was corporate-processed. In that light, "the movie’s critique of conformity becomes its opposite, a benevolent reassurance that the dominant order can tolerate a bit of disorder at the micro-LEGO level." Who's the lone grump? Kyle Smith at the New York Post. Like O'Hehir, he sees some hypocrisy: "Here is a movie in which a $15 billion toy merchant and a $57 billion entertainment conglomerate join forces to lecture us on the evils of buying." But really, he just can't take the movie's "toddler-meets-Red-Bull chaos. The experience is like being trapped inside a popcorn popper."

Story: – Police have arrested a white 48-year-old male after 11 people were killed and six injured Saturday during a baby-naming ceremony at a Pittsburgh synagogue, the AP and CBS Pittsburgh report. Identified as Robert Bowers, 46, the alleged shooter is said to have entered the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill and yelled "All Jews must die." The shooting occurred in a third-floor classroom where Saturday's class had been canceled, a former Tree of Life president tells the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. A man attending weekly Shabbat services says he heard repeating fire like that of an automatic weapon. Bowers reportedly shot at arriving police, who used their vehicles as shields amid the gunfire; four officers suffered non-life-threatening injuries. Bowers, described as heavy-set and bearded, was also wounded. A social media profile under the name Robert Bowers is full of anti-Semitic posts including one right before the shooting, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. "I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered," the post reads. "Screw your optics, I'm going in." All three congregations at the conservative synagogue—Tree of Life, Dor Hadash, and New Light—were having services when the shooting erupted. President Trump said Saturday that "it's a terrible, terrible thing what's going on with hate in our country, frankly, and all over the world," but said the shooting had "little" relation to gun laws: "If they had protection inside, the results would have been far better." A victims' center with grief counselors has been set up for survivors. The FBI is leading the investigation, which will be prosecuted as a hate crime, a Pittsburgh official tells CNN.

Story: – The man whose death at the hands of police prompted London’s massive riots did not shoot at the cops, a public investigatory body has concluded. Though Mark Duggan had a loaded gun, there was no evidence he fired it, the watchdog group said. A bullet stuck in a police radio was “consistent with being fired from a police gun,” and a firearms officer shot twice; he has been called off firearms work as the investigation continues, the Guardian reports. Duggan, 29, was riding in a minicab on Thursday in north London when firearms officers stopped the car to arrest him. He was killed by a shot to the chest and pronounced dead at the scene. The watchdog group is continuing to investigate and a coroner’s office is launching an inquest. Meanwhile, London authorities are taking action to block a fourth night of rioting, with 16,000 police now on the streets, the BBC reports.

Story: – Under the right conditions, hackers could theoretically exploit a built-in feature in smartphones to steal passwords and PINs, and it all comes down to the tilt users employ and the way they type, the Guardian reports. In a study published in the International Journal of Information Security, Newcastle University researchers note that most smart devices today come crammed with various sensors, from GPS to orientation and rotation features, but malicious sites and apps don't need to get user permission to gain access to many of these sensors—meaning they may "covertly 'listen in' on your sensor data," and from there pick up on your "touch actions," such as the PINs and passwords you type in, computer science expert Maryam Mehrnezhad says in a press release. The way users clicked, scrolled, and tapped on the devices, as well as the way they held them, resulted in a "unique orientation and motion trace," which allowed researchers to figure out what a user was typing on certain websites. Co-author Siamak Shahandashti compares it to a jigsaw puzzle: "The more pieces you put together, the easier it is to see the picture." In the end, the scientists hit a 70% accuracy rate on the first try when trying to figure out users' four-digit PINs; that number jumped to 100% after five tries. The researchers, who have informed Google and Apple of their findings, note that most users are more concerned about hackers gaining access to tools like a phone's camera or GPS, but this study shows there is reason to be concerned about a device's seemingly innocuous sensors as well.

Story: – In a wide-ranging interview this week, Donald Trump said the US economy is headed for disaster—unless, it seems, he takes the reins. He also compared himself to the Lone Ranger and predicted the American people will "be falling asleep" if he becomes president. Among the highlights of his Washington Post interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa: The economy is going into a "very massive recession," says Trump, despite popular economic forecasts to the contrary. "It's a terrible time right now" to invest in stocks, he adds. Will his words hurt financial markets? "I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them. I don’t need them." "I'm pessimistic," he says about the economy. "Unless changes are made. Changes could be made. I can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly." Trump says he can wipe away $19 trillion in US debt without gouging the nation's $4 trillion annual budget. "I'm renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that we’re doing so badly on," he explains. (Barry Bennett, a senior Trump advisor, also says Trump could sell off $16 trillion in government assets—although NBC News notes that the US government values its own assets at just $3.2 trillion.) "I bring rage out," Trump says of his combative style. "And after it’s all over, [my opponents] end up being my friends. And I see that happening here." But maybe not his GOP rivals: "I’m not sure they can ever go back to me. I was very rough on Jeb." He used phrases like "Jeb: Low energy. Little Marco," Trump recalls. "Names that were devastating." With his go-it-alone style, is he the Lone Ranger? "I am," he says. "Because I understand life. And I understand how life works. I’m the Lone Ranger." "And after I win, I will be so presidential that you won’t even recognize me. You’ll be falling asleep, you’ll be so bored." In a rare moment, Trump admitted to "a mistake."

Story: – Visitors who remove any bit of nature from a state park are breaking the law. But those who remove a chunk of petrified wood from Utah's Escalante Petrified Forest State Park risk something darker: an alleged ancient curse that visitors claim is the real deal. The park manager tells KSL that each year he's sent as many as a dozen pieces of petrified wood—which time has turned to stone quartz—typically accompanied by an apology in the hope that good fortunes will return to the one-time plunderer. One man wrote that he "thought the warnings were phony. Since that time, I have had three accidents" involving broken bones—plus a motor home fire and a dead car engine. Another wrote of three years of bad luck: "I hope with this act of restitution (the) Lord will have mercy upon me. I apologize and beg your pardon." It's an alleged curse not unique to Utah: In 2012 the Daily Sun looked at the "conscience rocks" mailed back to the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona, which claims the most petrified wood of any location on Earth. It sees as many as six letters a month, and has a 1,200-page archive of such letters that dates to the 1930s—when the story of the park's curse was believed to have been started. Still, the rumored curses haven't stemmed the thefts: In the case of Escalante, visitors now have to hike a mile into the park to even encounter the wood because the areas closest to the parking lot have been cleaned out; as for Arizona's 220,000-acre park, the National Park Service suspects as much as a ton of petrified wood is removed each month.

Story: – Democratic rebels wanted new blood at the top and they're going to get it—but possibly not until 2022. In a deal with rebels that will pave the way for Nancy Pelosi's return as House speaker, she has agreed to limit her time in the role to a maximum of four years. "Over the summer, I made it clear that I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus," Pelosi said in a statement, per the Washington Post. She said she plans to stick to the deal whether or not it is approved by the House caucus in a vote next year. The deal limits House Democratic leaders to three terms when they are in the majority, or four if they win two-thirds support, Politico reports. It applies retroactively to 2007, meaning Pelosi deputies Steny Hoyer and Jim Clyburn can also serve no later than 2022 in their current positions. The deal immediately won the support of seven Democratic holdouts who had demanded an overhaul of House leadership, giving Pelosi enough votes to reclaim the gavel, the Hill reports. (Before the deal, the Jan. 3 vote had been seen as a "showdown.")

Story: – Let the endgame begin: House Republicans say a vote on John Boehner's debt plan will still take place tonight, but the House speaker is apparently having trouble rounding up the necessary votes. Boehner predicted victory earlier today, but he halted debate on the measure about 5pm, reports Politico. Assuming he eventually gets to 217, Harry Reid continues to insist the Boehner plan will die a quick death in the Senate, after which Reid would try to force a vote on his own plan. (Eric Cantor is already threatening Reid with being responsible for a default, notes the Hill.) All of which suggests some last-minute scrambling will be going on through the weekend. "The smart money in Washington continues to be on some hybrid of the Boehner/Reid/McConnell plans," writes Ezra Klein in the Washington Post. "We’re looking at deal with no new revenue, significant new spending cuts, a spending-cut based enforcement mechanism for further deficit reduction, a series of debt-ceiling votes designed to embarrass Democrats, and a vote on a balanced budget amendment that’s also designed to embarrass Democrats."

Story: – Thousands of angry progressives are demanding the DNC pull the Democratic National Convention out of Charlotte in protest of North Carolina's vote to amend its constitution to ban same-sex marriage. A Change.org petition advocating the move has already drawn more than 27,000 signatures, and the same sentiment is lighting up Twitter feeds, the Raleigh News & Observer reports. "As an LGBT Democrat married in Iowa, I wouldn't set foot in North Carolina," read one typical tweet. No one expects the petition to actually work, of course. "The convention is staying in Charlotte," a DNC official tells Politico. But it's going to be an awkward venue, given that President Obama has now officially endorsed same-sex marriage, and Nancy Pelosi intends to spearhead an effort at the convention to make legalization of same-sex marriage an official part of the Democratic Party platform. It is, however, worth noting that Charlotte itself voted against the amendment.

Story: – Back in August, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers claimed to have obtained specialized NSA hacking tools, and put the code up for auction. Edward Snowden said the tools were probably legit. Reuters reporters heard the tools were used about three years ago for an undisclosed NSA operation. So if these tools are powerful and useful, why's no one biting? That's the question the Shadow Brokers seem puzzled by in their latest public release, posted on Medium. Although the Shadow Brokers feign confusion, it seems easy to understand why most people wouldn't want to bid on anything stolen from one of the US government's most powerful and secretive agencies. Nonetheless, a public auction is still ongoing. In the bizarre, rambling Medium post, the group states its goals quite clearly: "Expert peoples is saying Equation Group Firewall Tool Kit worth $1million. TheShadowBrokers is wanting that $1million." Despite the ambitious asking price, Gizmodo pegs the highest bid so far at around $1,082, to be paid via the anonymous crypto-currency Bitcoin.

Story: – Facebook had bad news for its news team on Friday: Sources tell Quartz that all 15-18 editorial staff on the Trending team were told at 4pm that they were being laid off and had to be out of the building by 5pm. The sources say the workers were given severance pay equivalent to their wages through to mid-September. The workers are out of a job because Facebook, apparently stung by controversies over alleged anti-conservative bias, has decided to drastically reduce the role that humans playing in choosing trending news stories to display to the site's users, the Washington Post reports. From now on, the stories in the trending section will be chosen by algorithm and viewers will see only the topic name and the number of people talking about it, not a written description. "A more algorithmically driven process allows us to scale Trending to cover more topics and make it available to more people globally over time," Facebook explains in a blog post. The only humans involved in the Trending section will be engineers, who will check for inappropriate, fake, or non-newsworthy stories, Recode reports. (In an earlier attempt to get rid of bias, Facebook stopped letting news outlets nominate topics as trending.)

Story: – The moon may be a lot younger than previously believed, according to scientists using the latest technology to analyze rocks brought back by the Apollo 16 mission nearly 40 years ago. The researchers say the rocks—a kind believed to be the oldest that can be found on the moon—are around 200 million years younger than they expected, making the moon 4.4 billion years old instead of 4.6 billion years old, the Los Angeles Times reports. Another possibility, the researchers say, is that the magma ocean believed to have covered the moon's surface soon after it was separated from the Earth by a collision with another planet was never there. Other researchers say the team may be jumping to the wrong conclusions, or looking at the wrong rocks, the AP notes. The new theory "is a little bit fancy for my taste," says a scientist who recently published a theory that the Earth once had two moons.

Story: – A Canadian company best known for building tiny objects suitable for outer space has just earned a US patent on something distinctly grander: a 12-mile-high inflatable space elevator held up not by cables but by pressurized segments, reports fastcoexist.com. That's more than 20 times taller than the world’s current tallest building, the nearly 3,000-foot-tall Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai. So why a space elevator? Because rockets (and, presumably, the space tourists inside them) require less force to launch when starting that much closer to the destination. "Landing at 12 miles above sea level will make space flight more like taking a passenger jet," says Thoth Technology CEO Caroline Roberts in a press release. The inventor says astronauts would reach the top via electrical elevator, from where rockets can launch in a single stage to orbit as well as return to refuel. If this seems far-fetched, it's actually less ambitious than Obayashi Corporation's hope to build a space elevator a quarter of the way to the moon by 2050, reports CNET. Even so, Thoth's ambition still requires building just beyond what is known as the "Armstrong Limit," or "the point at which atmospheric pressure is so low that your bodily fluids would boil off without a protective suit," reports Global Construction Review. The idea is gaining so much traction that Seattle is actually hosting a Space Elevator Conference later this month. (Obayashi plans to construct its space elevator not from Earth but from, well, space.)

Story: – Voter turnout is heavy in Massachusetts, but without exit polls it won't be clear until after the polls close at 8pm whether Scott Brown or Martha Coakley will be a senator. Based on comments and emails floating about, Democrats are terrified: A Coakley adviser fired off an angry email, obtained by Ben Smith at Politico, refuting the notion that she's at fault. The "DNC and other Dem organizations did not engage until the week before the election, much too late," it reads, adding that Brown capitalized on the trouble of President Obama and the national party. Obama adviser David Axelrod said his "hat's off" to Brown for a "very clever" campaign. He said the White House would have done more to help Coakley had it been asked earlier, notes the Chicago Tribune. Nancy Pelosi insisted at an afternoon news conference that health care reform would pass, no matter what happens in Massachusetts, reports AP.

Story: – The only remaining sexual abuse survivor on the Vatican's commission dealing with sexual abuse by priests has quit over what she calls "shameful" push back from the Vatican, Reuters reports. Marie Collins says the "last straw" for her was when the Vatican administration ignored a request from the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors that it respond to all correspondence from people who've been sexually abused by priests. According to the Guardian, Collins—who was sexually abused by a priest when she was 13—says it's hard to believe the Vatican truly cares about victims when it can't even bother to reply to their letters. Collins says she does believe Pope Francis wants to help victims, NBC News reports, but she's upset he's been reducing punishments and granting clemency to abusive priests. She says the pope is too quick to show mercy when it comes to priests sexually abusing children. Last summer, Pope Francis canceled a tribunal that was supposed to prosecute bishops who protected abusive priests. Collins also accuses the Vatican of a "lack of cooperation" with the commission that has led to "constant setbacks." "It is devastating in 2017 to see that these men still can put other concerns before the safety of children and vulnerable adults," Reuters quotes her as saying. The only other abuse survivor on the commission left in February 2016.

Story: – Whitney Houston's daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, is still in an Atlanta hospital after being found unresponsive in a bathtub Saturday morning—but while father Bobby Brown has issued a statement asking for privacy and his lawyer says "no additional information will be forthcoming," there seem to be plenty of sources close to the family willing to talk to the media. TMZ's sources say the 21-year-old was placed in a medically induced coma, but tests have revealed that her brain function is "significantly diminished" and her family has been told to keep praying, but prepare for the worst. Another source tells People that Bobby Brown is "inconsolable." Whitney Houston was found dead in a bathtub almost exactly three years ago, but this "is a million times worse, and to lose her in the same way would devastate him," the source says. Family friend Sammy Tawil says he spoke to Bobbi Kristina on Friday and she sounded hopeful and full of life. "There's people who want to say it's bleak, but there shouldn't be any rush," he tells the New York Daily News. "The family is concerned, but they're hopeful. She's a fighter. She's a lot like her mom." A police spokeswoman tells the Daily News that detectives have searched the home and found nothing to indicate that drugs were involved.

Story: – In what Education Secretary Arne Duncan says is "our first major action on this but obviously it won't be the last," an expanded—and expensive—debt relief plan has been approved for former Corinthian Colleges students. Some 16,000 were affected when the for-profit company closed its remaining campuses in April, but the federal plan will forgive loans for tens of thousands of other students who attended Corinthian schools since 2010 at a potential cost of up to $3.6 billion, the AP reports. Corinthian is accused of fraud, including inflating job-placement rates, and Duncan says he sympathizes with students who were left with huge debts and worthless degrees, the New York Times reports. "You'd have to be made of stone not to feel for these students," Duncan told reporters yesterday. "Some of these schools have brought the ethics of payday lending into higher education." The department has released a guide to options for Corinthian students and says the procedures it's putting in place will help other victims of "abusive for-profit colleges." The plan has its critics: "Students have been hurt, but the department is establishing a precedent that puts taxpayers on the hook for what a college may have done," says Sen. Lamar Alexander, per the Times. "If your car is a lemon you don't sue the bank that made the auto loan; you sue the company," the Republican says. (There's more than $1.2 trillion in US student debt, and this writer says it's time to default.)

Story: – In February 1493, Christopher Columbus described his historic journey of the previous year in a letter to the king and queen of Spain. Though the letter was reprinted and circulated throughout Europe, only about 80 copies remain—and now the US is sending one of them, a stolen one, back to Europe, reports the Los Angeles Times. The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement says the $1.1 million "Plannck II" copy donated to the Library of Congress in 2004 was being delivered to Italy after an investigation found it was stolen from Florence's Riccardiana Library and replaced with a high-quality photocopy decades ago, per the Local and Delaware News Journal. After a researcher finally detected the forgery in 2012, authorities received a tip that the real one was in Washington. New tests have revealed that to be true. Among other things, researchers detected bleach on the Library of Congress' copy, suggesting that the Riccardiana Library's stamp was once there but had been removed. It isn't clear when the letter was stolen from the museum, but officials say a Swiss collector somehow obtained it and sold it to an American in 1990. It was then purchased at a New York auction in 1992 before that owner donated it to the Library of Congress in 2004. "It is interesting how 500 years after the letter was written it has made the same trip back and forth from America," says Italy's culture minister, per NBC News. (Don't blame Columbus for syphilis.)

Story: – "Oxi" is Greek for "no," and it's a word coming from Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis' mouth today. He confirmed that, no, Greece would not be paying the $1.8 billion it owes to the IMF today. His comment comes amid speculation that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is trying to craft some sort of last-minute deal with creditors before the payment is due and before the European part of Greece's bailout comes to an end, per the AP. The Wall Street Journal reports European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker went to Tsipras last night to discuss an 11th-hour deal that would see a financing plan and budget cuts for Greece—so long as Tsipras essentially told Greeks oxi to oxi: to vote "yes" in Sunday's referendum. The Journal reports an about-face may have happened overnight, with an official yesterday maintaining Tsipras was still gunning for a "no" in the referendum; another official, however, this morning said "there is some movement." This reportedly follows calls Tsipras had today with Juncker, as well as European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi and European Parliament president Martin Schulz. As for those leaning toward voting "oxi" on Sunday, the New York Times has some fascinating backstory on the word, which it reports has "historical symbolism that makes it even more appealing in the present context. As every Greek schoolchild knows, the annual Oxi Day commemorates the answer, in spirit if not verbatim, delivered by Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas to a demand from Mussolini to allow Italian forces to occupy strategic parts of Greece at the beginning of World War II."

Story: – President Obama is rolling out major new steps to fight methane emissions, aiming to cut them by up to 45% of 2012 levels within a decade. The administration's rules will address the growing domestic oil and gas industries, whose expansion is expected to significantly increase the amount of methane sent into the atmosphere, the Los Angeles Times reports. The White House will use its executive authority in the effort against climate change, with the EPA putting new rules forward this summer to be finalized next year, the New York Times reports. The administration announced the new rules today, citing "benefits for the climate, the economy, and public health," USA Today adds. "This is the biggest opportunity to curb climate change pollution that they haven’t already seized," says an advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council. But the plan is already drawing criticism from both climate change activists, who say it doesn't go far enough, as well as industry leaders. The plan largely targets new efforts at oil and gas production rather than existing ones, which means it "misses 90% of the methane pollution from the industry," says a clean air advocate. "The administration is proposing to fight methane pollution with one hand tied behind its back." Meanwhile, the industry says new rules could hurt the current boom. A business leader tells the New York Times the industry is already "incentivized" to stop methane leaks, since "we want to bring it to market." In September, Obama similarly cracked down on power plant emissions.

Story: – A woman who claims she has no idea who she is says she hopes to reconnect with family and a mystery man she may have loved before she dies of cancer. The woman—who goes by Sam and is believed to be in her 50s—was barely conscious when she was found on the streets of Carlsbad, Calif., on Feb. 1 with no identification and no memory of how she got there. Doctors have since discovered Sam, who sometimes speaks with an Australian or English accent, suffers from stage-three ovarian cancer. She says they told her a "volleyball-sized tumor" on her ovary may have caused her amnesia, per the Sydney Morning Herald. "I just feel like there's a thick fog over my mind, my memory, over my brain," she tells NBC San Diego. "I can't remember anything," she adds, though she says she feels a connection to Australia and Hawaii, Mashable reports. She also dreams of a man who might be her husband. After months of uncertainty for Sam, who's living in a retirement community, tips are now flooding in, due in part to a Facebook group set up by nurses to help her out. One woman in Carlsbad tells NBC San Diego she knows the mysterious woman from a Bible study at a Catholic church on the same corner on which Sam was found. "She went by Samantha to us," the woman says, noting she thought she was homeless. "She was here from Australia. She referred to Australia back then." Another woman in Utah says she knew Sam by another name some 20 years ago in Arizona and says she's an "eccentric" American who sometimes used an English accent. When she called police yesterday, a woman said, "Sam had already been identified." Police then directed questions to the FBI. A rep from the bureau says vaguely that new information should help produce Sam's real identity soon. (An alleged amnesiac reportedly found his family after turning up in a snowdrift.)

Story: – “I am devastated,” the Miami Herald quotes Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel as saying. “Sick to my stomach. He never went in.” Israel suspended Scot Peterson—the school resource officer assigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland—pending an investigation into his actions during the Feb. 14 shooting that left 17 dead. Peterson, 54, resigned and retired shortly after his suspension was announced Thursday, the Sun Sentinel reports. He had been the school resource officer at Stoneman Douglas since 2009 and with the sheriff's office since 1985. He was named School Resource Officer of the Year for the City of Parkland District in 2014. But a review of witness statements and security footage from the Feb. 14 shooting called Peterson's actions into question, according to NBC Miami. Israel says Peterson was armed and "absolutely on campus" when the shooting started. He says Peterson took up a position outside the school and stayed there for over four minutes as the shooting went on. The sheriff says Peterson should have "went in, addressed the killer, killed the killer." "There are no words," he says. "These families lost their children." The investigation into Peterson will continue. Israel also admits to other possible failures in the months and years before the shooting. A tip to the sheriff's office in November that Nikolas Cruz "could be a school shooter in the making" didn't get written up. A relative had called the sheriff's office and asked it to seize Cruz's weapons weeks before the tip. And two years earlier a deputy investigated a report that Cruz "planned to shoot up the school" with nothing coming of the investigation.

Story: – When Darrell Issa called White House press secretary Jay Carney a "paid liar" on Sunday, House Republican leadership was aghast. They immediately called Issa's staffers, sources tell Politico, and their message was simple: Tell your boss to calm down. The staff agreed that the remark was out of line, but Issa himself has refused to publicly backtrack. "The White House has tried to vilify me rather than getting into the facts," he says. When asked about leadership's rumored gripes, he replied, "I didn't hear anything." House leadership doesn't want Issa to take the screws off President Obama, but they worry that the brash rhetoric from the Oversight Committee chair will give Democrats an opening to dismiss him and hence his investigations. One senior Republican said Issa had erred by shifting focus to Carney. "No one cares about Jay Carney. That's a sideshow." And some Republicans, including John McCain and Lindsey Graham, have been publicly distancing themselves from Issa's comments, USA Today reports. "Let's not make it personal," Graham said.

Story: – When you need a little extra oomph during a workout, try swearing. Researchers from the UK's Keele University report via the British Psychological Society that people perform better on tests of physical endurance when they curse. Specifically, 29 people around age 21 took part in a cycling test, and 52 people around age 19 took a hand-grip test. They were all tasked with choosing a neutral word to describe a table, such as "wooden" or "brown," and then a curse word they might utter if they hurt themselves, reports the Guardian. They were instructed to repeat each of those words in two separate tests in a steady, even tone, and, sure enough, they were stronger when muttering the curse word. "We're not telling people something they don't already know, but we're verifying that in a systematic and objective way," says researcher Richard Stephens. "I think people instinctively reach for swearwords when they hurt themselves and when they're looking for an extra boost in performance." Previous research has suggested that swearing also gives people a higher tolerance to pain, but exactly what's going on remains unclear. In the endurance tests, for example, people's heart rates didn't rise when cursing, suggesting that a "flight-or-fight" response wasn't at play. "We have yet to understand the power of swearing fully," says Stephens in a ScienceDaily news release. (Swearing is linked to honesty, too.)
Summary: 1. What was the purpose of the study conducted by the researchers from Keele University?2. How did the researchers measure the participants' physical endurance during the cycling and hand-grip tests?3. What was the result of the study in terms of the participants' performance when they muttered a curse word compared to when they repeated a neutral word?4. According to Richard Stephens, what does the study suggest about the power of swearing?5. How does the study's finding that heart rates didn't rise when cursing during the endurance tests differ from previous research on the topic?6. What does Stephens suggest is the possible explanation for the difference between the findings of this study and previous research on swearing and pain tolerance?7. How does the study's finding that swearing is linked to honesty relate to the overall findings of the study?8. What are some potential implications of the study's findings for athletes or individuals looking to improve their physical performance?9. How might the study's findings be applied in other areas, such as in the workplace or in everyday life?10. What are some potential limitations or criticisms of the study that could be raised based on the findings?
Story: – Handing your child a juice box might be easier than slicing up an apple. But for children under 1, it's the wrong move, according to pediatricians. Updated guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics state children under 1 shouldn't drink fruit juice "unless there is a strong clinical basis for it in the management of constipation," and older kids should drink it only sparingly, due to its high sugar content, report AAP News and the San Francisco Chronicle. The guidelines—which hadn't been updated since 2001—now set a daily limit of four ounces of juice for ages 1 to 3, six ounces for ages 4 to 6, and eight ounces for ages 7 and up. "We want kids to learn how to eat fresh foods," says the lead author of the new guidelines. "If you assume fruit juice is equal to fruit, then you're not getting that message." While juice may provide vitamin C, vitamin D, and calcium, fresh fruit provides additional fiber, protein. Juice also leads to cavities and increased calorie consumption, pediatricians say, adding it should be eliminated from the diets of children with excessive weight gain. "We do try to encourage parents to think about juice as a sweet, just as you would soda," one pediatrician tells CNN. "When you isolate fruit into a liquid form, you're mostly getting sugar water," adds a nutritionist. The guidelines previously recommended no juice be given to kids younger than 6 months. However, "there really isn't any need or beneficial role for juice" in children under 1, a co-author of the guidelines says. (Tomato juice tastes different on a plane.)
Summary: 1. What are the updated guidelines for juice consumption in children according to the American Academy of Pediatrics?2. Why are pediatricians advising against giving fruit juice to children under the age of 1?3. What is the daily limit of juice consumption for children of different ages according to the guidelines?4. What are the concerns about juice consumption according to pediatricians?5. How does juice compare to fresh fruit in terms of nutritional value?6. What is the role of fiber in a child's diet, and how does juice lacking in this nutrient affect their health?7. How does juice consumption contribute to cavities and weight gain in children?8. What is the recommendation for parents regarding the elimination of juice from their child's diet if they are experiencing excessive weight gain?9. How does the idea of "thinking of juice as a sweet" compare to the way parents should view other sugary drinks like soda?10.

Story: – A highly sophisticated network of hackers has been spying on hundreds of diplomatic computers around the world unnoticed for about five years, reports the Christian Science Monitor. The "Red October" malware being used is on par with the notorious Stuxnet and Flame viruses, but this time criminals—as opposed to governments—may be behind it, says Russian Internet security firm Kaspersky Labs. Sites in Russia and the former Soviet satellite states have been the most frequent targets, but the US has seen a handful of attacks, too. "This is the first attack that can be compared, judging by its complexity, with state-sponsored attacks like Flame," says an expert with Kaspersky. Details on exactly what got stolen are skimpy, but embassies, trade centers, nuclear research centers, and oil and gas facilities were targets, reports TheNextWeb. The attackers appear to have "Russian-speaking origins," but the software used suggests that Chinese hackers also played a role. Kaspersky provides the nitty gritty of its findings here.

Story: – A grand jury in upstate New York today decided that NASCAR's Tony Stewart will not face charges in the death of fellow driver Kevin Ward in August, reports the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. Maybe the more surprising part of today's news, however, is that the local DA revealed that 20-year-old Ward had levels of marijuana in his system that "were enough to impair judgment," reports NBC News. Ontario County DA Michael Tantillo did not offer specifics, but he said the grand jury was presented with Ward's toxicology results. Ward's family wasn't buying it: "All the other vehicles were reducing speed and not accelerating, except for Tony Stewart, who intentionally tried to intimidate Kevin by accelerating and sliding his car toward him, causing the tragedy," says a statement from his mother, Pam Ward. "The focus should be on the actions of Mr. Stewart and not my son. This matter is not at rest and we will pursue all remedies in fairness to Kevin." The younger driver was killed as he walked on the track after his car spun out, looking like he was trying to confront Stewart. He died when Stewart's car hit him.

Story: – Workers were blasting through the ground of a school construction site in the Ganzhou region of China four years ago when they found what scientist Steve Brusatte is calling "one of the most beautiful, but saddest, fossils I've ever seen," reports the Telegraph. That's because the creature appears to have had some decidedly unlucky final moments, which left it with its wings splayed and head arched up. That's right, the well-preserved fossil shows a dinosaur that died stuck in a bog. "It is the first oviraptorid dinosaur preserved as struggling," one of the researchers tells the New York Times. Reporting in the journal Scientific Reports, the scientists from China and Scotland say they've named the bird-like theropod Tongtianlong limosus, or "muddy dragon on the road to heaven." It's the sixth species to be found in this part of southern China in five years, reports National Geographic, and while still fairly mysterious, a picture is beginning to emerge of the flightless, feathered dinosaur. It's about the size of a small donkey and belonged to a group of theropods called oviraptorosaurs—which "are some of the most unusual dinosaurs," the scientists write. Without teeth, it had a very sharp beak and seems to have been flourishing 70 million years ago, on the eve of the great asteroid impact that "changed the world in an instant," as Brusatte puts it. For this creature, at least, that instant came sooner, and likely didn't happen in a flash. (China is also home to a trove of 7,000-plus dino fossils.)

Story: – "While reviewing dashcam footage," ominously begins the Dover Police Department's Facebook post, "we come across some interesting sights to say the least. We hope you enjoy this...and Taylor Swift, if you're watching...we're sorry." What follows is what it dubs a "Dashcam Confessional" in the form of 48-year-old Master Cpl. Jeff Davis lip-syncing rather enthusiastically to Swift's "Shake It Off"—which might seem like an unlikely choice for a gruff-looking cop, but the dad of four says he's more than passingly familiar with Swift thanks to his 10year-old daughter, reports the AP. And for the record, "Yes, I did know that the camera was on," he tells Fox News, via E! Online. Davis says there was serious intent behind the far-from-serious video: "With all of the negative publicity the police have been getting nationwide and worldwide, I think it was a good thing to show a little, the lighter side of the police," he says. "We are human and we have a tough job to do. We just wanna kind of make a funny video to show that we're all human." The video is complete with Davis in a classic try-and-act-normal-at-a-stoplight moment. It's currently closing in on 8 million views.

Story: – The labor dispute at American Airlines got ugly this week. The carrier accused its pilots of snarling thousands of flights by calling in sick and writing up needless maintenance orders, the LA Times reports. American even threatened a legal injunction if the alleged tactics continue. "We must take appropriate steps to protect the company and the many constituents who depend upon it," wrote an American executive in a letter. A spokesman for the carrier's 10,000 pilots says negotiations were imminent until the letter arrived "like a bucket of ice water on the process." So talks are on hold, and union leaders plan to meet Tuesday. Meanwhile, the carrier's on-time arrival rate reached 61% this morning, reports Bloomberg—a far cry from its usual 80%. Overall, American plans to reduce labor costs by up to 20%, and pilots say they're worried about rising healthcare costs, outsourcing, and pension cuts, among other issues.

Story: – President Obama's silence on the reported VA hospital scandal is over. Speaking today, he said he "will not stand for" alleged misconduct, including "cooking the books" to hide delays in care, some of which allegedly led to patient deaths. "If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable. It is disgraceful. And I will not tolerate it, period," he said, per the National Journal. If misconduct is discovered, "it will be punished," he said. "I know that people are angry and want swift reckoning." But he noted that time is needed for a full investigation to take place. Amid calls for VA head Eric Shinseki's firing, Obama called him a "great soldier" who's "put his heart and soul" into the department, Fox News reports. Twenty-six VA facilities are now under investigation in the scandal, CNN reports, per the Office of the Inspector General. White House deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors is reviewing the situation alongside Shinseki; Nabors is heading to Phoenix, the site of the first allegations.

Story: – When Pope Francis suggested Donald Trump's plan to build a wall between the US and Mexico was "not Christian," Trump's senior adviser shot back. "Amazing comments from the pope—considering Vatican City is 100% surrounded by massive walls," Dan Scavino tweeted Thursday. Rush Limbaugh said much the same thing, as did Trump himself later that night. But that's not exactly true, as several media outlets and Twitter users point out. Yes, there are some big walls, but "it isn't all surrounded by walls, and it's not like you need a separate visa or a passport to enter," Gerard Mannion, a Catholic studies professor at Georgetown, tells the New York Times. "You wouldn't know, almost, when you even entered Vatican City," he continues. "There is a white line painted on the ground in St. Peter's Square, but that kind of thing is not obvious everywhere." There are walls keeping visitors away from Pope Francis' guesthouse, but a second Catholic studies professor at the school points out that's standard for government buildings, noting, "You can't just walk into the White House." Some Vatican walls were built in the ninth century to ward off barbarians—other medieval cities had them, too. And Mannion says segments that came in the 15th and 16th centuries were less about defense and more about conveying the pope's "cultural and political power," as the Times puts it. "This pope didn't build them—and he certainly didn't build them to keep out poor migrants," a priest says, per CNN.

What is the perspective of a Catholic studies professor at Georgetown University on the issue, and how does their view differ from Trump's?7. How does the CNN report on the issue challenge or support Trump's claim, and what do they reveal about the pope's stance on the matter?8. What is the broader context of the debate around immigration and border security in the US, and how does it relate to the Vatican's stance on the issue?9.

Story: – When Cody and Eva Borek of Alberta, Canada, bought a new SUV, they won a five-day trip to Hawaii, complete with free airfare and five-star hotel accommodations—and decided to pay it forward instead of taking the trip themselves. And so they created a Facebook page to help in their search for the "most loving person," which they initially confined to central Alberta but have opened up to all of North America. The Christian couple are looking to award the trip to someone "who lives like Christ," though that person doesn't have to be Christian or even religious, but "loving, forgiving, caring, and compassionate," reports ABC News. Nominations will be accepted through Jan. 24, and more than 5,000 poured in between Christmas and New Year's Eve, UPI reported Wednesday, with one man, John Myslicki, topping the charts with more than 100 nominations. An avid traveler without a current passport, Myslicki wrote to Cody that he hoped they'd "pick someone who has never had the opportunity to travel," to which Cody replied, "He's like Santa Claus." (CBC News notes the retired teacher looks like Santa, too.) With so many nominations to look through, Eva and Cody have decided to put the names of the 10 most nominated people in a hat and draw the winner on Jan. 25. In the meantime, they say they've enjoyed sharing the heartwarming stories of Good Samaritans around the world. (Read about one Good Samaritan from Maine.)

Story: – A California mayor has really stepped in it. Dennis Kneier, mayor of San Marino, tossed a bag of dog poop into his neighbor's driveway—and, unfortunately for him, the moment was caught on video. He's resigning immediately over the incident, CBS 2 reports. "As is well known, early in the evening of Saturday, June 7, I had a lapse of judgment and discarded dog waste on a neighbor’s walkway," Kneier wrote in his resignation letter. "It was insensitive, disrespectful and wrong. I have apologized to my neighbor for my action, and I will pay a fine for littering." According to the neighbor, Phillip Lao, the two men haven't seen eye to eye on Kneier's policy moves, leading to running disagreements. Lao earlier suggested Kneier should "resign in shame" over the incident and said he'd file harassment charges against Kneier and San Marino. During a City Hall meeting last week, others agreed that Kneier should resign from his post, which, KTLA notes, is mostly ceremonial. "What in the world were you thinking?" asked one. Vice mayor Eugene Sun will take over as temporary mayor, and Kneier will continue as a city councilman.

Story: – All it took for Dylan O'Donnell to capture this image from his perch in southeastern Australia of the International Space Station (visible in the upper-right part of the frame) passing in front of the moon: a Canon camera set to burst mode, a Celestron telescope, and a quick eye, per his website. The European Space Agency says the amateur photographer took the photo on June 30 as the ISS, soaring 250 miles above the Earth, flew by at almost 18,000mph, meaning it was only in view for about a third of a second. O'Donnell credits alerts from an online astronomical calendar for letting him know when the space station does its "flyovers," noting he had been waiting a full year for this photo op. "If you think that it might be a case of sitting there with your camera and a clock, with one hand on the shutter release, you'd be absolutely correct!" he notes. (Too bad his telescope-camera contraption couldn't pick up the space station's new espresso machine.)

Story: – Hillary Clinton set the internet on [fire emoji] [fire emoji] [fire emoji] Thursday when she hit Donald Trump with what the Verge describes as "an old, but hardly stale meme." “Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary," Trump tweeted. "He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does!” Clinton (or more likely her staff) quickly retorted: "Delete your account." The AP reports Clinton's tweet was retweeted 130,000 times in an hour. It had 260,000 retweets within five hours. The AP says it could be the most retweeted tweet ever. PC Magazine calls it “a perfectly phrased social media salvo” and dubs it the start of the "meme campaign." "'Delete your account' is used when someone has tried to be funny on Twitter—for example, by attempting to land a sick burn—and failed," Vox explains. It argues Trump's tweet wasn't "his strongest material," earning himself a "delete your account." Fusion quickly added Clinton's tweet to its list of the best all-time uses of the meme. A number of public figures tried to ride Clinton's social-media coattails, with Reince Priebus tweeting to Clinton, “If anyone knows how to use a delete key, it’s you.” Anthony Weiner chimed in: "Too late for some of us."

Story: – Ronnie Smith was supposed to be headed home to America for the holidays this week. Instead, the 33-year-old chemistry teacher was shot dead while jogging in Libya this morning. Smith, a US citizen, had taught at the International School in Benghazi for a year and a half and was "very much loved," the school principal tells NBC News. Smith can be seen interacting with students on his Twitter feed: In the last exchange posted, an apparent student tweeted at him yesterday, "Knowing im getting 100% on my sci exam tomorrow makes me soo happy @ISBchem right?" He responded: "yep. I already recorded it. 10%." "He was the most amazing person, more like a best friend or a family member," another student tells NBC. "After everything that happened in Libya, we were losing hope and he was the only one who was supporting us, motivating us, telling us that as long as we studied everything would be OK. He was the silver lining. He dedicated so much of his time for all his students. He chose to come here and help us and risk his life." She adds that he was in Egypt before coming to Libya, and hadn't seen his family in a long time. The AFP reports Smith has a wife and a 2-year-old child, but it's not clear whether they were with him in Libya. No motive is yet known, but the New York Times reports that witnesses say Smith's attackers were driving a black Jeep.

Story: – A day after Paris' horrific terror attacks (and the same day ISIS claimed responsibility), a member of Minnesota's DFL Party posted a tweet he now regrets. Per a screenshot via the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Burnsville's Dan Kimmel—who was running for the state House against a 22-year-old incumbent—posted, "ISIS isn't necessarily evil. It is made up of people doing what they think is best for their community. Violence is not the answer, though." Apparently that last part of the tweet wasn't enough to soften the rest of it, because people on social media jumped on him, as did DFL Party chief Ken Martin. In a DFL statement, Martin says Kimmel's comments "do not reflect the views of the Minnesota DFL and have no place in our party" and he asks Kimmel "to apologize to all the families who have been torn apart by the terrorist organization and their senseless violence." Kimmel initially tried to walk back his tweet, including with a follow-up post that read, per the Star Tribune: "I deplore evil acts of ISIS. I do not defend their acts." But Townhall.com reports that House DFL Minority Leader Paul Thissen jumped into the fray Saturday with his own statement, in which he also called for a Kimmel apology, as well as an end to his House campaign. And that's exactly what Kimmel did Sunday, announcing he was ending his run (as well as his social media accounts, apparently). "My tweet … was … poorly worded and did not convey my intent," he wrote on his website. "I am very sorry for 'spreading ick' on other candidates and the DFL party. I will do everything I can to help resolve the issue: most likely the best thing for me to do is shut up. The tweet was stupid. I'm sorry." (ISIS says the Paris attacks were "miracles.")

Story: – Democrats nearly had another political disaster on their hands thanks to Evan Bayh, writes David Kurtz. They got lucky, however, when a no-name cafe owner failed to come up with enough signatures by today's deadline to represent Democrats in the primary. Now that Tamyra d'Ippolito is out of the picture—even though she claimed to have the signatures earlier in the day—party officials in Indiana will be able to place a more seasoned candidate on the ballot. The development "would seem to end the d'Ippolito boomlet—fueled partly by conservatives looking to cause trouble for Democrats—before it even began, but we're still confirming the particulars," writes Kurtz at Talking Points Memo. The would-be candidate raised eyebrows when she accused the party "machine" of getting her bumped from Rachel Maddow's show. An NBC official responds to Ben Smith at Politico: "I think you can guess that Rachel doesn't really have a tight connection with the 'machine' politics of the Indiana Democratic Party."

Story: – Remember the dad who shot up his daughter's laptop, posted the video on YouTube, and set off a fevered debate on why he was either the best or worst parent in the world? At the Los Angeles Times, Meghan Daum isn't much interested in hashing out those "culture wars." Instead, she points out that Tommy Jordan's video might just herald the "end of shame." To understand why, recall that all this started when Jordan's daughter humiliated him by complaining about her parents on Facebook. Jordan has the tough luck of being "among the first generations of parents to raise kids who don't vent about their parents by writing in a diary or yakking on the phone or carrying on at the school bus stop—but by posting their grievances online." He intended to repay his daughter in kind by humiliating her in public. The problem is, she and her generation are largely immune. He "tried to embarrass someone who's so accustomed to people exposing themselves online that it doesn't occur to her to be embarrassed," writes Daum. "He hurt himself worse than he hurt her." Read the full column here. Too abstract? Just check out five parodies of the video compiled by Mashable.

Story: – Some 59% of Russians believe the US is a threat to their country and of that number, 31% say a US invasion and occupation is possible. The latest opinions, courtesy of a Levada Center think tank poll of 1,600 adults, offer further evidence that relations between the two countries are at their iciest in 25 years. A poll back in 2007 found just 47% of Russians believed the US posed a threat. Of those concerned by the US this time around, 48% mentioned worries that the country would disrupt Russia's development, 40% said the country could take over the Russian economy, 36% feared they'd be subjected to American values and ideals, and 24% worried the US would alter Russia's political path, according to the Moscow Times. The GlobalPost reports Russia's state media is likely to blame for the shift in sentiment, as it carefully crafts coverage of events like the Ukraine conflict to flatter the Kremlin at the expense of the West. Still, the feeling is shared here at home. A Gallup poll from February found 18% of Americans view Russia as the US' greatest enemy, compared to just 2% in 2013. Secretary of State John Kerry attempted to mask any unfriendliness during a visit to Russia yesterday, however. He and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov exchanged gifts of tomatoes, potatoes, a T-shift, and a leather portfolio before joining Vladimir Putin for local wine and "significant, serious" conversation about Syria and Ukraine, Kerry said, per the Wall Street Journal.

Story: – A teenage boy who was kidnapped as an infant has been reunited with his father thanks to a school official's suspicion. When Sandy Hatte, 60, tried to enroll the boy at a school in northern Missouri, the official contacted police and discovered the boy had been abducted 13 years ago. Hatte—the boy's paternal grandmother, according to WDAF—has been charged with felony child abduction. Investigators say she had no legal rights to the child but had attempted to portray herself as his mother, the St. Joseph Post reports. One day in 2000, the boy's father "was working, came home from work, and [Hatte] was gone with the baby," a police spokesman tells ABC. "He hasn't been able to find them since." Investigators believe that Hatte and the boy spent the last 13 years moving around different cities, counties, and states, and were homeless at least once over the period. When the boy met his father again, it "was a good reunion," the police spokesman says. "You could tell within the first three minutes they hit it off pretty well. Since then, I've been on the phone with the dad and from what I'm understanding, it's going pretty well." (Click for the story of a 1964 kidnapping that made headlines ... this summer.)

Story: – For the past 30 years, scientists have been exploring a cemetery in Egypt whose origins are mysterious. One thing they have determined, however: "We are fairly certain we have over a million burials within this cemetery. It's large, and it's dense," says the project's director, Kerry Muhlestein of Brigham Young University. Dubbed Fag el-Gamous, the grounds are full of bodies that date to between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, Live Science reports. The remains don't belong to royalty, and most weren't actively mummified by people—but the dry surroundings led to what could "loosely" be called mummies, says Muhlestein, who has blogged about the findings. Brigham Young researchers have dug up more than 1,700 burials over the past three decades, they write in Studia Antiqua, noting that they're not the first researchers to investigate the site. Among recent findings are the remains of an 18-month-old from about 1,500 years ago. "There was some evidence that they tried much of the full mummification process. The toes and toenails and brain and tongue were amazingly preserved," researchers say. As for where the child, or countless others, came from, researchers aren't sure. Interestingly, a database reveals that blond people appear to have been buried together, with red-headed ones elsewhere; this could be due to families being buried together, researchers note. They also found one body that was more than seven feet tall—particularly surprising given poor nutrition at the time. (Perhaps they should alert this giant hunter.)

Story: – The plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the US had the support of elements of the Iranian government and Iran is going to pay, US officials vow. "The United States is committed to holding Iran accountable," Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters after the plot was exposed. Hillary Clinton says the US plans to work with its allies—and countries that might have previously been on the fence— to further isolate Iran and "send a very strong message that this kind of action, which violates international norms, must be ended," Fox reports. The plot shows the world "that nobody is safe from the Iranians," Clinton tells Reuters. "They have their own logic, their own way of thinking about the world and their place in it and they're vying with everybody for influence." The State Department has warned Americans around the world that Iran appears to have adopted "a more aggressive focus" on terrorism, and that attacks on US interests are possible. The Saudi embassy in DC described the plot as "a despicable violation of international norms," while Iran called the allegations a "fabrication," the Los Angeles Times reports.

Story: – More details are emerging on Wade Michael Page, the Army vet suspected of killing six at a Sikh temple near Milwaukee, and his involvement in white supremacist groups. Over the past 10 years, Page played guitar and sang in at least two skinhead punk bands, Fox News reports: Definite Hate and End Apathy. "[Song] topics vary from sociological issues, religion, and how the value of human life has been degraded by being submissive to tyranny and hypocrisy that we are subjugated to," Page said in a 2010 interview with End Apathy's label. The band's MySpace page describes its music as "a sad commentary on our sick society and the problems that prevent true progress." White power songs are often so violent—discussing genocide against minorities, among other topics—that experts say the music is usually only available online. Page first came to the attention of the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2000, when he attempted to buy goods from a hate group, and a director from the group says he has attended "hate events" and was definitely "involved in the scene." He was also known to law enforcement, although an FBI agent won't say why. Police say Page acted alone, but the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports that authorities are looking for a second person of interest, a man with a 9/11 tattoo who was on the scene yesterday, possibly taping the chaos.

Story: – News of the World has been linked to another shocking case of phone hacking—and this might be an even bigger betrayal. Police have informed Sara Payne that she was on a list of people seized from a private investigator employed by NotW, Reuters reports. The twist: The paper’s editor, Rebekah Brooks, is believed to have given Payne the phone in question, according to the Guardian. Brooks calls the allegations "abhorrent," adding in a statement, "the idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension." NotW had a close relationship with Payne, whose eight-year-old daughter, Sarah, was murdered by a pedophile in 2000. The paper campaigned on her behalf for a law forcing pedophiles to disclose their addresses, dubbed “Sarah’s Law.” Payne even wrote a stirring farewell for the paper’s final edition, calling its staff “my good and trusted friends.” Now she’s “absolutely devastated by this news,” says a statement from the charity she founded. “We're all deeply disappointed and are just working to get her through it.”

Story: – Leon Panetta delivered a harsh rebuke to Israel yesterday, saying that it needed to take steps to end its increasing isolation in the Middle East—starting with reviving peace talks with the Palestinians. “Just get to the damn table,” Panetta said at a pro-Israel forum in Washington, according to Reuters. “The problem right now is we can’t get ‘em to the damn table, to at least sit down and begin to discuss their differences.” Panetta also said he’d wrestled with Israel about launching a preemptive strike to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. “You always have the last resort … of military action,” he said. “But it must be the last resort, not the first.” Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barack today shot down speculation—prompted by recent explosions—that Israel was already in a shadow war with Iran, but said that “no option should be taken off the table," Haaretz reports.

Story: – Donald Trump's adult children were on the Republican National Convention floor in Cleveland Tuesday evening to witness their father take the GOP nomination for president, and two of them took to the stage to offer their personal take on the man who fathered them. Tiffany Trump, Trump's daughter with Marla Maples who just graduated from college, stepped up first and tried to humanize her dad. "Donald Trump has never done anything halfway, least of all as a parent," she said, recounting that her dad would scribble encouraging notes on her report cards. "My dad is a natural-born encourager," she said, per the AP. She also added that when she lost someone close to her, "the first call I got, as I knew I would, came from my father," per Variety. Donald Trump Jr., meanwhile, took a more political tack, noting America needs a president "who has a track record of accomplishing the impossible." He notes Don Sr. spent his career "pouring concrete and hanging sheetrock," not hiding out in the executive suite, and that his entire family "learned from people who had doctorates in common sense." He added a slag against Hillary Clinton, noting that the US needs to elect a president "who knows we can't simply delete our problems but that we have to tackle them head on. ... who will unleash the greatness of our nation. That president can only be my mentor, my best friend, my father, Donald Trump." Donald Trump's other adult son, Eric Trump, is set to speak at the convention on Wednesday; daughter Ivanka will step behind the mic on Thursday.

Story: – The parade of JonBenet Ramsey-focused TV specials beats on, now with a 20/20 special airing Friday. A press release on the hour-long show zeroes in on two of the handful of people who sat for interviews: First, a member of the grand jury that voted to indict John and Patsy Ramsey in the 1996 death of their daughter. The juror claims to have seen secret evidence in the course of grand jury proceedings that he says makes it clear to him who murdered JonBenet, reports People. The Denver Post in October 2013 reported the grand jury's charges didn't accuse the Ramseys of murdering their daughter, but instead of putting her in a situation that led to her death; former Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter decided not to sign off on the grand jury's recommendation. The second big-name guest is DA Stan Garnett, who will address this week's news that the state plans to conduct new DNA tests on the underwear and long johns the 6-year-old was wearing when she was killed. A Daily Camera/9News investigation suggested that former DA Mary Lacy erred when she exonerated members of the Ramsey family in 2008 based on her interpretation of earlier DNA tests. ABC News reports 20/20 last month obtained those test results, and noted that Lacy referenced a "match of male DNA on two separate items of clothing," though "match" was never used in the lab notes. In fact, the lab said the DNA "should not be considered a single source profile." Garnett says he doesn't expect "any dramatic developments" from the new testing. He's "always felt that the Ramsey case is not really a DNA case," but authorities "want to make sure."

President Obama is expected to sign the bill into law next week, though it could take up to a year for Don't Ask, Don't Tell to be formally lifted because of military reviews required by law, notes MSNBC. “We righted a wrong,” said Joe Lieberman, who with Susan Collins co-sponsored the measure. “Today we’ve done justice.” In the end, eight Republicans joined Democrats, including the expected (Collins, Olympia Snowe, George Voinovich, Lisa Murkowski, and Scott Brown) and the day's surprises (Richard Burr, John Ensign, and Mark Kirk), notes Politico.

Story: – Joseph Kabila has been president of the Democratic Republic of Congo since 2001. His second—and constitutionally mandated final—term ended Monday at midnight. Only the 45-year-old Kabila refused to step down. Here's what you need to know: With Kabila refusing to relinquish power, violence is breaking out. The Guardian reports 20 people were killed as protesters clashed with security officials. Oddly, Kabila's chief diplomat tells Newsweek that Kabila would be guilty of treason if he stepped down. The country failed to hold an election in November as planned, and the diplomat says the constitution requires Kabila to stay in power until a successor is elected. But the ruling party states that won't happen until April 2018 at the earliest. The New York Times reports it might not be desire for power that's keeping Kabila from ceding the presidency but rather a fear he'll lose his fortune in the process. Investigators say Kabila has stolen millions in public assets through "dubious mining rights sales" and "possible money-laundering schemes." In the months leading up to the end of Kabila's second term, the Washington Post did an extremely rare public opinion poll in the Democratic Republic of Congo, finding that 81% of people don't want the constitution changed to give Kabila a third term and 74% want him to step down by the end of the year. The Guardian notes that the current situation isn't rare for the country. The Democratic Republic of Congo hasn't had a peaceful transfer of power since gaining independence 56 years ago and is facing what could be an especially violent period. Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of Congo's former colonial ruler—Belgium—says it will "re-examine" its relationship with the country in the wake of what some are describing as a coup by Kabila, according to the Independent.

Story: – After more than 20 suspicious fires in the space of a few weeks, it didn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that an arsonist was at work in the small town of Mayerthorpe, Alberta—but the real shock was the suspect's identity. On Saturday, volunteer firefighter Lawson Michael Schalm, 19, was arrested and charged with 18 counts of arson, including one relating to a spectacular fire that destroyed a rail trestle bridge last week, the National Post reports. Authorities say Schalm, the son of an ex-mayor, helped fight at least five of the fires and was a bystander at several others. "We're certainly very shocked, bewildered, wounded, and a little hurt," fire Chief Randy Schroeder says. "The discovery that one of our own potentially lit 18 fires is definitely affecting our station." Schroder tells Global News that the situation is "heartbreaking" and firefighters are struggling to deal with the apparent betrayal by Schalm, who started out as a cadet at 15 and had good prospects of becoming a career firefighter. "I would like to be able to roll the tape back metaphorically speaking and get a better understanding," the chief says. Former mayor Albert Schalm says that while he is shocked by the allegations, his love for his son is "unconditional" and there "will always be a dinner plate at my table" for him." I refuse to throw my son under the bus. I'm not that kind of dad," he tells the CBC. "My goal is to get him back on the road, get his future going again." (This California man filmed himself starting a massive wildfire and is now serving 20 years in prison.)

The reminder came after a man came very close to death trying to save his mother-in-law's dog from a fast-flowing river Monday, the Times of London reports. The man's wife threw him a life ring when she saw he was in difficulty and she desperately clung to the rope for 30 minutes to stop him being swept out from the Suffolk harbor to sea before a lifeboat crew arrived, reports Coastal Scene. Lifeboat crew member Keith Meldrum says the water was "incredibly fast-flowing" and the man was close to death from cold and exhaustion when he was brought to safety. His wife had rope burns on her hands, while the dog was "perfectly fine" after being wrapped in blankets for 20 minutes. The man "was exhausted from fighting so hard against the force of the water and was at a critical stage when we got to him," Meldrum says, adding: "Everyone on the lifeboat crew understands the urgency and the temptation to jump in after your dog. But this is the second time this year we have had someone go into the harbor after their dog—and it’s the second time they have been dangerously close to death by the time we have pulled them out." In a Facebook post, the local branch of the volunteer Royal National Lifeboat Institution notes that other people whose dogs fell in the harbor had the animals rescued safely after calling emergency services. (This guy saved his dogs by fighting off a cougar.)

Story: – "I just think he ignored it," and it cost him his life, says the mother of Kyler Baughman, a 21-year-old Pennsylvania man who died days after Christmas. The cause: "Organ failure due to septic shock caused by influenza." The flu-related death is getting outsize attention in part because of Baughman's chosen career—he was studying to be a personal trainer, is described by his mother as "into physical fitness," and frequently posted photos of himself lifting weights to Facebook, reports the Washington Post. Beverly Baughman tells WPXI he seemed rundown over the Christmas holidays and came home from work early on the 26th. She says he thought rest would be a cure-all, but by the following day he was in the ER, and on the 28th he was dead in a Pittsburgh hospital. His case: Dying from the flu is far from unheard of: CDC figures show 6.7% of all deaths in the US during the week ending Dec. 16 were related to pneumonia or the flu. It also notes that the flu was widespread in 46 states in the last week of 2017, with Hawaii, Maine, New Hampshire, and New Jersey reporting regional flu activity. But NBC 10 notes that the very young, the old, and those with fragile immune systems are most at risk; indeed, of the 18 flu deaths reported thus far in Pennsylvania for this flu season, Baughman's is the only one in the 19-49 age group. His family's advice: Implores dad Todd Baughman, "Try and know your body. Don't let things go. Whenever you have a fever for multiple days, don't let it go, get it taken care of."
Summary: 1. What was Kyler Baughman's profession, and how did his career choice contribute to his death from the flu?2.

What is the advice that Kyler's family is giving to others in light of his death, and why is this advice important?7. How does the article highlight the importance of taking flu seriously and seeking medical attention when necessary?8. What can be done to prevent flu-related deaths, and what responsibility do individuals have in protecting themselves and their loved ones?9. How does the article contribute to the larger conversation about public health and the importance of vaccination?10. What can be learned from Kyler's story about the importance of taking care of one's health and seeking medical attention when needed?
Story: – The US government may have found somewhere where it can effectively ban WikiLeaks. The 1,500 Americans currently in Antarctica with the US Antarctic Program have been warned that the diplomatic cables published by WikiLeaks are classified information and the transmission, processing or use of the information on USAP systems is prohibited, Gawker reports. USAP controls the communications networks for America's three Antarctic bases so the memo means that the WikiLeaks information is effectively off limits for all Americans on the continent, who are mostly scientists and support staff. This could be a problem for geologist John Goodge, who writes a blog from Antarctica for the New York Times, which has published many of the leaked cables.

Story: – Bernie Sanders was arrested. Well, he was arrested 53 years ago, anyway. The Chicago Tribune discovered photographic evidence of Sanders' involvement in the fight for racial equality this week in the form of a negative from its archives showing a bespectacled Sanders being hauled away by police during a 1963 protest in Chicago's South Side. The New York Times reports there's also video from the same incident that was released Monday by Kartemquin Films, which is making a documentary about the protests. "Bernie identified it himself," a senior Sanders advisor tells the Tribune regarding the photo. "He looked at it…and he said, 'Yes, that indeed is (me).'" He also specifically remembered the watch he was wearing in the video of the arrest. Sanders was 21 and a student at the University of Chicago, where he would graduate with a degree in political science, at the time. He was charged with resisting arrest and fined $25. The protest was part of many against Chicago's practice of sending black students to school in trailers rather than putting them into white schools. The Times states Sanders has faced attacks from Clinton's campaign over his civil rights bonafides. And the Tribune believes this new evidence "bolsters the candidate's narrative about his civil rights activism." The photo and video could end up helping Sanders in the upcoming South Carolina primary, where he needs more support among black voters, according to Time. Sanders was a leader with the Congress of Racial Equality while at the University of Chicago and led a number of protests against inequality.

Story: – Spanish bond yields hit a whopping 7% today, after Moody's cut the country's credit rating to just one level above "junk" yesterday. The New York Times ominously notes that the 7% mark is the level that "triggered" full-blown bailouts of other eurozone countries. Moody's said Spain's recent bailout—which was supposed to boost confidence—will increase the country's debt burden, the BBC reports. If the rating falls any further, many index funds will be forced to sell, sending the country's borrowing costs even higher. "The risk of losing investment grade" pushed the spreads to "historic highs," one analyst explains. Italy's borrowing costs shot up, too, from 3.9% to 5.3%. "We certainly know Italy will have to pay higher yields to attract market demand," an analysis firm tells the Wall Street Journal. The current spreads "are certainly not reflecting the fundamental picture for the country, which, although in the middle of a recession, is not broke."

Story: – A virus called enterovirus-68, or EV-68, continues to hospitalize kids around the country in unusually high numbers with respiratory trouble, and federal health authorities are trying to figure out whether there's a connection between the virus and cases of kids with paralysis or limb frailty, reports the New York Times. Colorado has the biggest cluster of such cases at 10, but several others have been reported in Michigan, Missouri, and Massachusetts. Bloomberg has the total at 17. Some of the kids have tested positive for the virus, but not all, making any connection unclear. “It's one possibility we are looking at, but certainly not the only possibility,” says a CDC official. The agency has asked hospitals across the country to report new cases. Earlier today, the CDC said for the first time that the virus—also often abbreviated as EV-D68 or D68—was found in four people who had died, reports the Wall Street Journal. Three were adults, but one was a 10-year-old girl in Rhode Island. Hers is the first death of a child at least linked to the virus this year, though it's not clear whether the virus is to blame. The girl died of a staph infection, reports the Boston Globe, and tests after her death also confirmed the presence of the virus. "If D68 wasn't around, [the death] could have happened anyway," says the state's health chief. "Thinking about this as a D68 death is a mistake." The virus has been turning up in the US for decades and usually causes symptoms similar to a cold. This year's rash of patients with breathing trouble is unusual, a CDC official tells Bloomberg.

What is the current understanding of the relationship between EV-68 and the four deaths that have been linked to the virus?6. How does the presence of EV-68 in four people who died, including a 10-year-old girl, affect the understanding of the virus's potential impact?7. What is the significance of the fact that some of the children who have tested positive for EV-68 have not shown any respiratory symptoms, and how does this complicate the investigation?8. How does the CDC official's statement that "Its one possibility we are looking at, but certainly not the only possibility" reflect the current state of knowledge about the connection between EV-68 and the paralysis or limb frailty cases?9. What is the significance of the fact that EV-68 has been turning up in the US for decades and usually causes symptoms similar to a cold?10. What are the implications of the unusual rash of patients with breathing trouble this year, and how does it compare to previous outbreaks of EV-68?
Story: – In a matter of months, Twitter users will be able to use filters on the site to make their photos look pretty or old-timey or whatever, reports the Bits blog of the New York Times. Sound familiar? Right. The site wants to better compete with Instagram, and "it could prove to be an important part of the company's business," writes Nick Bilton. Some reaction: Daniel Terdiman, CNET: "This would potentially be a very big move for Twitter, because it could keep people taking photos on smartphones from using the Facebook-owned Instagram altogether." Casey Chan, Gizmodo: "It does seem like a ‘too little, too late’ move by Twitter but the act of sharing Instagram pictures on Twitter (which a lot of people do!) is a little awkward. If Twitter could bolster its Twitter photo service (which they should have done from the beginning), maybe people won’t even have to sign up for Instagram." Drew Olanoff, TechCrunch: Eh, "adding filters does not cancel out Instagram whatsover." It's a "fantastic community" in and of itself, and plenty of its users have no interest in Twitter or Facebook. It's going to be fine. "Twitter is merely keeping up with the Joneses."

Story: – Donald and Crystal Howard went out on Halloween to buy more face paint and candy. But the Georgia parents were killed in a car crash near their Morgan County home, leaving a young state trooper with a terrible task: breaking the news to their four kids, ages 6 to 13, NPR reports. But 24-year-old Trooper Nathan Bradley, who found out it would take their next nearest relative hours to get there, didn't want the kids to find out the tragic news from a stranger; he also wanted to protect the memory of Halloween for them. So instead, he took the children out for burgers, followed by a movie night back at the trooper post, where they were joined by the sheriff and other residents. It wasn't easy. "It was important to me that I would not lie to them," Bradley tells the Atlanta Journal Constitution, noting he distracted the kids and changed the subject when their parents were brought up. The kids' grandma arrived the next morning and told the children the terrible news. Bradley gave the oldest child his phone number so he could call whenever he needed to and set up a GoFundMe page for the kids, which has amassed $225,000 as of this writing. The kids are now preparing to move to Florida with their grandmother. Not everyone finds the story inspirational. Over at Gawker, Brendan O'Connor wonders if the trooper should have been upfront with the kids in what he labels "a legitimate ethical conundrum." "Instead of associating Halloween with the tragic death of his parents, the eldest—at least initially, and eventually, probably the rest of the kids—will associate it with being deceived for literally hours on end by an authority figure withholding from him the fact that his parents had died." (Hear the entire story from Bradley's perspective on the GoFundMe page.)

How did the community react to Bradley's actions, and what was the outcome of the GoFundMe page he set up for the children?5. Do you think Bradley's decision to distract the children and change the subject when their parents were brought up was the right thing to do, or do you agree with Brendan O'Connor's argument that it could be seen as deceiving the children? Why or why not?6. How do you think the children will remember Halloween in the future, and how will their experience with Bradley affect their perception of authority figures?7. What lessons can be learned from this story about how to handle difficult situations involving children, and how can we ensure that their emotional well-being is prioritized?8. How does this story highlight the importance of empathy and compassion in the actions of authority figures, and how can we encourage more people to show these qualities in their interactions with children?9. What are your thoughts on the grandmother's decision to move the children to Florida, and how do you think it will affect their emotional healing process?10. How can we ensure that the children receive the support and care they need to heal from this traumatic event, and how can we as a society ensure that their memories of Halloween are not tainted by the tragic events that occurred?
Story: – "These are the couples you would expect to have the most egalitarian relationships," is how researcher Claire Kamp Dush describes the participants in her study of dual-earner straight couples as they transitioned to parenthood. The male and female both work, are more highly educated than the average American, and plan to keep those jobs after they have a child—so what happened when that child was born? Kamp Dush and Jill Yavorsky of Ohio State University said participants both anticipated their daily workload would get a lot heavier, and equally so: The 182 couples reported divvying up household chores equally pre-baby (logging about 15 hours a week on top of 42 to 45 hours at their job); post-baby, they thought their workload would increase by four hours a day. The reality, as told by their time diaries, was a lot lighter and less balanced: about 10 more hours a week for men to women's 21, writes Kamp Dush (herself a tenured professor and mother of four) at the Conversation. How Yavorsky sums it up in an OSU article: "The birth of the child dramatically changed the division of labor in these couples. What was once a relatively even division of household work no longer looked that way." Neither men nor women reported working less at their job, post-baby. The findings appear in the Journal of Marriage and Family and were based on a somewhat slim pool of data: a total of just four diary entries per participant in which they logged 24 hours of activity on one weekday and one weekend; they recorded the activity once during the third trimester and once 9 months after birth. (If you're a woman who out-earns your husband, we have related disappointing news for you.)
Summary: 1. Can you provide more information about the sample size of the study? How many couples were included in the study, and how were they selected?2. How did the researchers measure the division of labor in the couples before and after the birth of their child? Did they use any specific tools or methods to collect this data?3. The study found that the couples' expectations about their workload increasing after the birth of their child were not met. Can you elaborate on what the couples reported in their time diaries about their workload and how it changed after the birth of their child?4. The study also found that the division of household chores became less balanced after the birth of the child. Can you provide more information about how the couples divided up household chores before and after the birth of their child? Were there any differences in the way men and women allocated their time to household chores?5. The study mentioned that neither men nor women reported working less at their job after the birth of their child. Can you provide more information about how the couples' work hours changed after the birth of their child? Did the men's and women's work hours increase or decrease?6. The study found that the couples' expectations about the impact of having a child on their workload were not accurate. Can you provide more information about why the couples' expectations were not met? Was it due to a lack of understanding about the realities of caring for a newborn, or were there other factors at play?7. The study also mentioned that the findings were based on a relatively small pool of data. Can you provide more information about the limitations of the study and how the findings might be generalized to other populations?8. The study highlighted the fact that women who out-earn their husbands were particularly affected by the changes in the division of labor after the birth of their child. Can you provide more information about why this might be the case? Is it due to societal expectations and gender roles, or are there other factors at play?9. The study suggests that the transition to parenthood can have a significant impact on the division of labor in couples. Can you provide more information about how this impact might be managed and how couples can work together to create a more balanced division of labor?10. Finally, what are the broader implications of this study for our understanding of gender roles and the division of labor in couples? How might these findings inform policies and interventions aimed at promoting greater gender equality in the workplace and at home?
Story: – A Pennsylvania county clerk has been issuing same-sex marriage licenses, saying state laws against the practice are unconstitutional—and now the state capital is fighting back. State attorneys say there's no "value or legitimacy" to the more than 150 licenses issued in Montgomery County since July 24, and thus they don't merit a court defense. "Had the clerk issued marriage licenses to 12-year-olds in violation of state law, would anyone seriously contend that each 12-year-old ... is entitled to a hearing on the validity of his 'license'?" the attorneys ask, per the Philadelphia Inquirer. Dozens of the affected couples are pushing to join in on the case, but state officials say they need to either file their own lawsuits or wait for federal opposition to Pennsylvania's law, NBC Philadelphia reports. "This case is about one thing: whether a local official may willfully disregard a statute based on his personal legal opinion that the statute is unconstitutional," the state attorneys say. Next week, the case heads to the state's Commonwealth Court.

Story: – A 17-year-old in Palmdale, Calif., was shot dead early Thursday after he tried to stop somebody else's pit bull from attacking police officers. Los Angeles County officials say Armando Garcia-Muro was hit by a "skip round" that ricocheted off the ground when deputies fired at the charging animal, the Los Angeles Times reports. Police say the animal bit deputies responding to a complaint about a loud party at around 3:40am. Armando restrained the animal and brought it to the back of the apartment complex, but he was shot when it broke free and charged at police again. Sheriff's Capt. Christopher Bergner says it was an "extremely, extremely unfortunate incident," the AP reports. He says deputies, who fired when the dog was around 10 feet away, apparently didn't see the teenager in the darkness. The bitten deputy was also hit by a bullet but received only minor injuries. The dog's owner tells the LAT that it was off the leash when police turned up, but the animal was "well-mannered" and she finds it hard to believe it attacked deputies. Armando's mother says her son, the oldest of four siblings, was a "very loving person" who liked dogs and planned to go into construction after finishing high school. The dog was shot but survived. Police say they plan to have it euthanized.

Story: – Unions began as a powerful and much-needed force for good, raising workers from "scraping out a meager living in low-paid and dangerous jobs into the middle class," and nowhere more so than in Chicago, writes Dennis Byrne in the Chicago Tribune. But the teachers' strike is a different story: It's showing children "the meaning of greed." During a recession, teachers should be more than happy with an average salary of $71,000—especially after the city offered a 16% raise. At Salon, however, Rick Perlstein fervently disagrees. There's a reason why you hear car horns honking in solidarity all over the city, he writes. Mayor Rahm Emanuel is "obsessed" with proving his "toughness," but why is he only tough with workers and protesters, and not with "the vested interests, including anti-union charter school advocates" who gave his campaign millions? He wants to see "20% more work" for "2% more pay." Regardless of who's right, it's time for negotiations to open to the public, writes Andrew Rotherham in Time. Both sides' private stances differ from what we're hearing in the papers. Click through for Rotherham's full argument.

Story: – Justin Trudeau has vowed to legalize marijuana across Canada by this July. CNN reported in December that there's one legislative obstacle left, and it explains that if the bill is indeed made law, the time to market should be much more rapid than in the US, as the country already has the infrastructure in place: Canadians approved for medical marijuana can already purchase it via "government-supported" sites online and have it delivered to them. With access likely set to become broader, BuzzFeed flags a government guide to marijuana that explains a lot of the basics about what it is and how it's used. Less expectedly, it offers a list of slang terms for pot that raised BuzzFeed's eyebrow. It has dubbed it the "most useful and mockable part" of the page. Nine standouts:

Story: – The days of "calling 8" after suffering a personal injury may be over. WGRZ reports Cellino & Barnes, a Buffalo-area law firm known for its omnipresent ads and catchy jingle, may be breaking up after Ross Cellino filed suit against Stephen Barnes on Wednesday. The suit calls for the dissolution of Cellino & Barnes, which Cellino's father started in 1958, according to the New York Times. It's unclear why Cellino is suing Barnes, but the Buffalo News reports it could hypothetically be for reasons ranging from the partners no longer agreeing on anything to financial improprieties. Barnes is due in court May 19 to explain why the law firm shouldn't be dissolved. Barnes and Cellino have been practicing together for more than 30 years and now head, as People puts it, "one of the most well-known personal injury law firms." By spending heavily on ads—which include its "Don't Wait, Call 8" tagline and easily memorized 800-888-8888 phone number—Cellino & Barnes expanded to offices throughout New York and California and became a household name. “They basically invented themselves out of thin air with very thoughtful, successful, innovative advertising,” fellow Buffalo attorney Paul Cambria tells the News. He says their split will be the equivalent of "a huge business divorce." But social media users just want to know who gets custody of the jingle.

The Post notes that Tillerson's work in Russia on behalf of Exxon is likely to result in "intense scrutiny" during the confirmation process.

Story: – Irritated penny-pinchers are still tallying up the costs of the First Family's Hawaiian vacation. Because Michelle and the girls went on ahead while the president wrestled with the payroll tax cut extension, some estimates put the price tag for the get-away at $4 million. Now critics are eyeing Michelle's clothing, claiming the ostensibly "causal" Sophie Theallet sundress she wore to Christmas services likely cost $2,000—and a Commes des Garcons skirt set her back at least a grand, reports the Daily Mail. "She claims to be a champion of the poor and a bargain shopper, but here she is, sporting a dress that no unemployed American can afford," sniffed one Naked DC writer. But another remarked: "The cost of her clothing is her own affair and none of ours. Taxpayers are not paying for her wardrobe the last I heard."

Story: – Netflix’s recent price hike caused rampant backlash, cost the movie rental service one million subscribers, and sent the company’s stock tumbling. Last night, CEO Reed Hastings admitted in a blog post, “I messed up.” But he’s not offering a reversal on the price hike, simply an explanation that, he admits, should have come earlier: Netflix is spinning off its classic DVD-by-mail service; it'll now be a distinct entity known as Qwikster, while Netflix itself will become streaming-only. The Wall Street Journal notes that while Qwikster will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Netflix, the two websites (including movie queues and ratings and account information) will not be integrated. Needless to say, already-dissatisfied customers don’t appear to feel too much better about the whole prospect. (Take a quick look at the comments under the blog post if you don’t believe us.) Some reactions: “It's yet another example of failing at the speed of light,” writes Austin Carr in Fast Company. “The faster Netflix moves to innovate, the more bumps it hits on the way.” “Netflix is a company in crisis,” writes Seth Abramovitch at Gawker, but this “fix … will likely please no one. … They say they're doing it to grow, but is offering consumers two companies to boycott instead of just one really going to make things any better?” In New York, Caroline Bankoff asks, “Is everyone happy now? Anyone?” (One big, hilarious oops: Netflix doesn't control @Qwikster.)

Story: – Video footage of a University of California police officer taking money from a hot dog vendor on the campus of UC Berkeley has gone viral, and a GoFundMe campaign has raised tens of thousands of dollars for the vendor in just one day. On Saturday, Los Angeles resident and former Berkeley student Martin Flores was ordering food for his children after a Golden Bears football game when the officer interrupted the sale to give the vendor a citation, the East Bay Times reports. After he pulled out his phone and started recording, Flores got footage of the officer taking the vendor's wallet and pocketing the money he found. That night Flores posted the video on Facebook, where it has been viewed 11.4 million times, the Los Angeles Times reports. Thus far, Flores' GoFundMe page has raised more than $37,000 to cover the vendor's "legal and personal [losses]" and "to cover other vendors who have been robbed of their hard earned living through citations and removal of their carts." But UC police Sgt. Sabrina Reich told KTVU that the vendor was cited for selling without a permit and that the money, $60, was taken as "suspected proceeds of the violation and booked into evidence." Flores, however, says the officer gave the vendor the citation as people were drinking in public nearby, also a crime. "This was about identifying one vendor," Flores says. "If you want law and order, be law and order across the board."

Story: – Tuesday brought the news, via New York Magazine, that a group of "prominent computer scientists and election lawyers" had told Hillary Clinton's camp that she should ask for a vote recount in three swing states—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania—due to the possibility results "may have been manipulated or hacked." A series of reports Wednesday threw cold water on the theory. That hasn't dissuaded Jill Stein, or her followers, from picking up the ball: BuzzFeed reports that the Green Party presidential candidate on Thursday morning—and within fewer than 24 hours of trying—raised the $2.5 million she was looking for to cover the hefty filing fees for a recount in the aforementioned states, "where the data suggests a significant need to verify machine-counted vote totals," per the fundraising page. The filing deadline for Wisconsin is Friday. As of this writing, her fundraising total stands at $2.67 million. The individual filing fees are: $1.1 million for Wisconsin, $600,000 for Michigan, and $500,000 for Pennsylvania. The fundraising page explains any recount cost would be borne by the state, but attorneys' fees and recount observers would bring the amount Stein needs to the $6 million-to-$7 million range. NBC News notes that after hitting $2.5 million, the fundraising goal on the page was changed to $4.5 million. The push to secure a recount "is not intended to help Hillary Clinton," the campaign tells BuzzFeed. "These recounts are part of an election integrity movement to attempt to shine a light on just how untrustworthy the US election system is."

Wheldon's car sailed into the crash fence surrounding the track and burst into flames. "I've never seen anything like it," driver Ryan Briscoe told AP. "The debris we all had to drive through, it looked like a war scene from Terminator or something. There were pieces of metal and car on fire in the middle of the track with no car attached to it and just debris everywhere. It was scary." Wheldon was airlifted from the track to University Medical Hospital. He died surrounded by his wife, his baby and toddler sons, a brother and sister. Wheldon was the first driver to die from race injuries since 2006. He was competing to win a $5 million bonus. "Big day today," he tweeted before the race. "Heading to the track."

Story: – Here's a college class that actually exists: a theology course studying ... the songs of Bruce Springsteen. Rutgers University will offer the class, the Guardian reports. It seems the Boss' lyrics often include religious references, mostly from the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament to Christians), though he was raised Catholic. Redemption is a common theme and "Mary" a common name for women who appear in his songs. "On a literary level, Springsteen often recasts biblical figures and stories into the American landscape," the professor of the course tells Rutgers Today. He offers some examples: "The narrator of 'Adam Raised a Cain' describes his strained relationship with his father through the prism of the biblical story of the first father and son." "Apocalyptic storms accompany a boy's tortured transition into manhood in 'The Promised Land.'" "The first responders of 9/11 rise up to 'someplace higher' in the flames, much as Elijah the prophet ascended in a chariot of fire ("Into the Fire")." There are also "Jesus Was an Only Son" and "In the Belly of the Whale," a reference to the Jonah story. Princeton also once offered a Springsteen-focused sociology course, Time reports.

Story: – The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Trump administration on Thursday, refusing to reinstate the president's executive order restricting immigration and refugees from seven majority-Muslim nations, the Washington Post reports. The decision upholds the ruling of Judge James Robart made last Friday, which first blocked Trump's travel ban. The court bought into the arguments of Washington state and Minnesota that the ban—even a temporary reinstatement of it—would cause harm to the states, specifically their universities, according to the AP. Reuters reports it was a unanimous ruling of all three judges on the Court of Appeals. In its ruling, the court found the Trump administration failed to show the US would be harmed if the travel ban weren't reinstated. It also didn't completely buy the administration's arguments for why the ban is needed, and ruled that comments by Trump and his advisers could be used to determine the intent of the ban, CBS News reports. The court didn't rule on the constitutionality or legality of Trump's executive order, only that the suspension of it could be kept in place. Trump responded in a tweet following the ruling: "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" The executive order will likely now head to the Supreme Court, where a 4-4 split is probable. In the case of a tie, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling would hold.

Story: – A 69-year-old Southern California man has been charged with murdering his 29-year-old son for being gay, the Los Angeles Times reports. Police say Shehada Issa killed his son Amir Issa with a shotgun outside their home on Tuesday.

Story: – The gay men behind fashion icon Dolce & Gabbana have spoken out against gay couples having children—and Elton John says he will never wear their clothes again. The singer joined gay rights groups in calling for a boycott of the label after Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana criticized IVF and non-traditional families in an interview with Italian magazine Panorama, reports USA Today. "We oppose gay adoptions," the pair said, according to the Telegraph. "The only family is the traditional one. No chemical offsprings and rented uterus: Life has a natural flow, there are things that should not be changed." They also called people born through IVF "synthetic children." John, who is raising two sons with husband David Furnish, slammed the designers for their "archaic thinking," for calling his children "synthetic," and for "wagging their fingers" on IVF—"a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfill their dream of having children." Dolce and Gabbana—who dated each other for more than 20 years—backtracked a little after controversy erupted, reports the Guardian. "I'm Sicilian and I grew up in a traditional family, made up of a mother, a father, and children. I am very well aware of the fact that there are other types of families, and they are as legitimate as the one I've known," Dolce said. "But in my personal experience, family had a different configuration. That is the place where I learnt the values of love and family."

Story: – California farmer John Duarte could be facing a $2.8 million fine—and may be ordered to pay millions more in wetlands mitigation—for an offense he describes thusly: "Planting wheat in a wheat field," something he says had been done many times previously. Duarte has been fighting legal battles since 2012, when he hired someone to plow 450 acres of land he had purchased near Red Bluff in central California, USA Today reports. Because the area included wetlands, the US Army Corps of Engineers ordered work to stop and sued Duarte for failing to obtain a permit and for allegedly carrying out "deep ripping" that went as far as 3 feet down, disturbing waters considered to be "waters of the United States" under federal regulations. A Pacific Legal Foundation lawyer says this is the first case he knows of where a farmer had to get a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to grow crops. "We're not going to produce much food under those kinds of regulations," he says. Federal prosecutors say Duarte violated the Clean Water Act because his activities deposited dirt into wetland streams. The case is scheduled to go to trial in August, though Duarte says the Trump administration has made it clear it considers the rule involved to be "dead," the Modesto Bee reports. He says unless the case is dropped, he will take it to the highest court possible to make sure other farmers aren't "shaken down by government agencies." (Meanwhile, a study finds that it is indeed possible to grow potatoes on Mars.)

Story: – Erica Morales had always dreamed of being a mother, her friends say, but she died before she could even hold the quadruplets she gave birth to on Thursday night. The 36-year-old had been admitted to the hospital with high blood pressure Tuesday and died in intensive care soon after the four babies were delivered by C-section. She had been about seven months into her pregnancy, and family members say the quadruplets—girls Paisley, Tracey, and Erica, and boy Carlos—are doing well in the hospital, where they will probably remain for the next two months, CBS reports. They weigh between 2 and 3 pounds each. Christina and Nicole Todman, Morales' cousins and best friends, tell the AP that Morales and her husband, Carlos, had been trying to conceive for two years, and after an earlier miscarriage, she had focused on doing "everything to make sure they were healthy so she was able to bring them into this world—and she did." "We are here to be a mother figure for these children because they are never going to meet their biological mother," Christina tells KPHO. Family members say there were complications before Morales was taken into surgery, but it's not yet clear what went wrong.

Story: – Google made a major move into the hardware business with its "Made by Google" event Tuesday, with many experts noting it appears ready to go head-to-head with a particular tech giant. Here's what you need to know: Lifehacker has a lengthy explainer of "everything ... that actually mattered" at "Made by Google." That list includes Google's new Pixel phones, Google Assistant, Google Home, and Chromecast Ultra. On the other hand, CNET discusses everything "we didn't get" at "Made by Google," including a tablet or laptop and Andromeda—an operating system rumored to combine Chrome and Android. As for the aforementioned Pixel phones, CNET reports they're Google's "best shot at making history again" by taking on the iPhone directly in a "showdown between two of the world's most powerful tech titans." TechCrunch focuses on Google Home, the company's version of Amazon's Echo that goes on sale Tuesday. The wireless speaker picks up voice commands to give you the weather, play music, queue up YouTube videos, and more. The Verge gives a quick review of some of the other hardware announced by Google, including the Daydream View virtual reality headset and Google WiFi, Google-made routers that can give maximum WiFi coverage around the house and even let parents kick their kids off the internet when it's time for bed. USA Today reports that Google Assistant—which is integrated into both Google Home and the Pixel phones—was the "star" of the event. Google CEO Sundar Pichai says he wants Assistant to be a "personal Google for each and every user." Finally, the Verge concludes that the major takeaway of "Made by Google" was one of imitation: "The overriding thing that Google will try to sell us is its vision of integrating that multiplicity of physical gadgets and trinkets into its digital empire of software and services. Just like Apple."

Story: – A crowd gathered for Fourth of July fireworks saw celebration turn to disaster as an explosion hurt 28 people. Twenty of those were hospitalized, four with "moderate to severe injuries," NBC Los Angeles reports. Their wounds, however, aren't life-threatening, the AP notes. The incident occurred in Simi Valley, Calif., near Los Angeles, during an event that had been expected to draw between 8,000 and 10,000 people. After just a few minutes of fireworks, "everything exploded and parts came flying everywhere," a witness says. "People were running everywhere." Authorities say the explosion was the result of a wooden platform that fell over, taking fireworks with it, the AP reports. "For some unknown reasons the structure that holds these ordinances collapsed," says a police commander. "The ones that had actually ignited ... were going directly into the crowd." A Myrtle Beach, SC, fireworks show also resulted in injury: A shell went off early, injuring a worker and putting a hole in a pier.

Story: – Police in Germany say a man in custody has confessed to a staggering 700 shootings of passing vehicles on the country's highways over the last five years. The suspect, a 57-year-old truck driver, was arrested after a massive police operation involving decoy trucks and license plate detection devices across the country, the Independent reports. Police seized a cache of firearms during the weekend operation, the Telegraph adds. Police say the man fired shots from the cab of his truck at vehicles coming in the other direction, causing multiple traffic accidents and almost killing one woman who was shot in the throat. His favorite targets appear to have been new cars being transported from factories. The reward for information leading to his arrest was quadrupled to $130,000 last year after he switched from .22 ammunition to 9mm.

Story: – How is it that just a couple inches of snow managed to cripple Atlanta? CNN calls it "a perfect storm—pun intended—of factors." Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal called Tuesday's storm, which left commuters stranded on gridlocked highways and forced students to spend the night at schools, "unexpected," saying forecasts had predicted the worst conditions would be south of the city. But a CNN meteorologist disputes that idea and says Atlanta was warned; he himself predicted up to 2 inches of snow, and 2.3 inches fell. Numerous reports indicate the city had been warned of the coming weather by Monday, and other Southern states took more precautions. Even Al Roker has taken Atlanta to task over the "gamble" it took. And Deal admitted he didn't want to be "accused of crying wolf" and wasting millions of dollars, the AP reports. Once the snow started falling, according to Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, part of the problem was that businesses and schools released workers and students at the same time, leading to the gridlocked roads. "If I had my druthers, we would have staggered the closures," he says. Former Lt. Gen. Russel Honore has a better idea: Schools and government offices should never have been open at all on Tuesday. (Both the governor and the mayor were at an award luncheon when the snow started to fall, and a state of emergency was not declared until after 5pm Tuesday.) And, funny as it may seem to Northerners, a few inches of snow really is a big deal in the South. Atlanta doesn't have the capability to salt all its streets before a storm, like Northern cities do, explains the CNN meteorologist: "Why would you buy 500 snowplows and salt trucks and have them sit around for 1,000 days, waiting for the next event?" It also didn't help that once the gridlock began, salt trucks couldn't even get around. And some Atlantans are complaining that a larger mass transit system and more roads are necessary. Meanwhile, how are things looking now? The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that temperatures are still extremely low but will rise above freezing this afternoon, and there are still problems with black ice in some areas—so, though some parts of the interstates are safe, others aren't, and neighborhood streets are still in bad shape. As for the hundreds of abandoned vehicles, state agencies are bringing owners to retrieve them starting today. How many car accidents? The Georgia State Patrol responded to more than 1,460 between Tuesday morning and last night, two of them fatal.

Story: – A tiny for-profit company out of Montana has landed a $300 million contract to help get the power back on in Puerto Rico, reports the Spokesman-Review. How tiny? Whitefish Energy had just two full-time employees on the day Hurricane Maria slammed into the island. However, the company suggests that figure is misleading because its business model is based on being able to ramp up quickly with the hiring of hundreds of subcontractors. Still, the contract with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority seems "unusual," in the words of the Washington Post. It's not only the biggest one awarded there in the wake of Hurricane Maria, it also seems to go against disaster protocol. That is, PREPA could have activated "mutual aid" agreements with other public utilities, which would have been obligated to help. Florida's, for instance, reached out publicly to offer assistance but never heard back. "I'm scratching my head wondering how it all adds up," a former Energy Department official tells the Post. PREPA's chief has said Whitefish was the first "available to arrive and they were the ones that first accepted terms and conditions for PREPA.” Whitefish CEO Andy Techmanski, meanwhile, tells CNN that "we called each other." Whitefish is based in Whitefish, Mont., the hometown of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, but both Techmanski and Zinke say the fact that they know each other played no role. The Daily Beast, meanwhile, reports the company is financed by a private equity firm called HBC Investments, founded by Joe Colonnetta. And Colonnetta is a big supporter of President Trump: Last year, he gave $20,000 to the Trump Victory PAC, $2,700 to Trump's primary election campaign, $2,700 to his general election campaign, and $30,700 to the Republican National Committee.

How does it compare to the "mutual aid" agreements that other public utilities could have activated in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria?2. How does Whitefish Energy's business model work, and how does it allow the company to ramp up quickly with the hiring of hundreds of subcontractors? What are the implications of this model in terms of accountability and transparency?3. What is the relationship between Whitefish Energy and the Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who is from the same hometown as the company? Does Zinke have any involvement in the awarding of the contract to Whitefish, and if so, what is his role?4. Who is the CEO of Whitefish Energy, Andy Techmanski, and what does he have to say about the company's involvement in Puerto Rico? How does he respond to criticisms that the contract is unusual and goes against disaster protocol?5. What is the background of the private equity firm HBC Investments, which finances Whitefish Energy? What is the connection between HBC Investments and President Trump, and how does this impact the perception of the contract award to Whitefish Energy?6. How does the fact that Whitefish Energy is a small, two-person company at the time of Hurricane Maria contrast with the scale of the $300 million contract they were awarded? What does this say about the company's capabilities and the vetting process for contractors in disaster situations?7. What is the response of other public utilities, such as Florida, to the awarding of the contract to Whitefish Energy? How do they justify their decision not to activate "mutual aid" agreements, and what are the implications of this decision for the people of Puerto Rico?8. How does the story of Whitefish Energy and the contract award to the company fit into the larger narrative of the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria and the ongoing recovery efforts in Puerto Rico? What are the political implications of the contract award, and how does it reflect on the administration's handling of the disaster?

Story: – The 26-year-old shooter who killed nine people at Umpqua Community College in Oregon this week killed himself during a confrontation with police, Sheriff John Hanlin announced Saturday. The BBC reports a medical examiner determined the shooter's cause of death to be suicide. In other developments Saturday, new interviews with survivors and their families cast doubt on whether or not the shooter was specifically targeting Christians, as previously reported. According to the AP, the shooter may have only asked victims if they were "religious," not "Christian." And one official speaking anonymously with the AP says the shooter left a pages-long "manifesto" at the scene of the shooting. He would not reveal what was in the document, and police have yet to identify a motive for the shooting.

Story: – Class presentations don’t get much more unconventional: last week Northwestern psychology professor John Bailey held an optional after-class demonstration in which a naked woman had an orgasm live onstage, as a man identified as her fiance used a sex toy known as a “fucksaw” on her. The girl was not a student, according to the Daily Beast. The sex act was the climax (no pun intended) of a talk by guest lecturer Ken Melvoin-Berg, who offers sex tours of Chicago. “Both Professor Bailey and myself gave them five or six warnings about what was about to happen,” Melvoin-Berg tells the Chicago Tribune. Some students left, but about 100 stayed as a naked woman came onstage and explained that she had a fetish for being watched by large crowds. The event has created a bit of a stir, but the school has issued a statement standing behind Bailey, and the professor is unrepentant. “Sticks and stones may break your bones,” he reportedly told another class this week, “but watching naked people on stage doing pleasurable things will never hurt you.” For more, click here.

Story: – It's tough to find a story any messier than this: In what it is calling an "exclusive," the New York Daily News yesterday reported by way of a source that ex-Oasis frontman (and married man) Liam Gallagher fathered a 7-month-old love child with music reporter Liza Ghorbani. According to the article's time stamp, the New York Post ran a story of its own just shy of an hour later, reporting the same thing via "sources" and adding that a DNA test has proved it. Now the Daily Mail reports that while Gallagher's lawyer refuses to comment on the "gossip," he did say "legal action" was being taken against the Post. The airing of the names follows the earlier report that Gallagher was being sued by an unidentified woman for $3 million in Manhattan Family Court. But that lawsuit was filed as the less-than-telling Anonymous vs. Anonymous. Per the Daily News, the affair allegedly began when Ghorbani wrote a 2010 profile of the rocker for none other than the New York Times. "He started an affair with her that night, they took a few months off, then started again," says the source. "It went on until she told him she was pregnant. He cut it off. He was so paranoid his wife would find out." The Post's slightly different take: "It continued until around three months after the birth of the child. He ended the relationship when she told him she was suing him for child support." Gallagher, who is married to Nicole Appleton, has three kids—one of which was the result of an affair during his first marriage, the Mail notes.

Story: – For only the eighth time in history—and the first since 2013—a 15th-seeded team beat a 2nd-seeded team in the NCAA men's basketball tournament when Middle Tennessee State bested Michigan State on Friday, the New York Times reports. And just like that, nary a perfect bracket was to be found. CBS Sports and Yahoo! Sports tweeted after the game that all brackets submitted to them had been busted. ESPN basketball fans are apparently a bit more savvy, as Sports Center tweets there are three perfect brackets left there. But it wasn't just Middle Tennessee State causing trouble. According to the AP, lower-seeded teams were 11-9 through 20 games of the tournament. The Times calls Middle Tennessee State's 90-81 victory over Michigan State "one of the most stunning upsets in NCAA tournament history." More than 99% of Yahoo! brackets had Michigan State winning the game. About 25% of Yahoo! and ESPN brackets had Michigan State advancing to the Final Four. And More than 27% of Yahoo! brackets and 22% of ESPN brackets had Michigan State winning the whole thing. Meanwhile, Middle Tennessee State was playing in only its second NCAA tournament in 27 years.

Story: – Good news for cats: Mice are no longer afraid of them—at least mice that have been infected with a parasite common in mammals. Not only does Toxoplasma gondii leave mice less afraid and thus more likely to venture into striking distance, the effects last after the parasite has cleared, reports a PLoS One study. "Long after we lose the ability to see it in the brain, we still see its behavioral effect," says a Berkeley researcher. In fact, that effect might be permanent, reports Nature.com. How do scientists explain the weird phenomenon? It could be the parasite being very, very sneaky, explains Science News. It can only reproduce inside a cat's gut, and an easy way for it to get there is by way of a delicious, fearless mouse. The parasite achieves the trick by eliminating the mouse's fear of cat urine, reports NBC News. Once infected, the mouse is actually attracted to the scent.
Summary: 1. What is Toxoplasma gondii, and how does it affect mice?2. How does the parasite manipulate the behavior of infected mice, and what are the implications of this manipulation?3. What is the mechanism by which the parasite reproduces inside a cat's gut, and how does it ensure its survival?4. How does the elimination of fear in infected mice impact their behavior, and what are the potential consequences for the mice and their ecosystem?5. What are the potential applications of this research in fields such as pest control or disease transmission, and how could it inform strategies for controlling populations of mice or other animals?6. How does the fact that the parasite can only reproduce inside a cat's gut impact its ability to spread and infect other hosts, and what are the implications for the ecology of the host-parasite relationship?7. What are the potential long-term effects of this manipulation on the behavior of infected mice, and how could it impact their survival and reproductive success?8. How does the discovery of this manipulation impact our understanding of the complex interactions between hosts and parasites, and what are the broader implications for our understanding of ecology and evolution?9. What are the potential ethical considerations of this research, particularly in terms of the impact on non-human animals and the potential for unintended consequences?10. How could this research be used to develop new strategies for controlling populations of mice or other animals, and what are the potential benefits and drawbacks of such approaches?
Story: – Seventy years ago, the US dropped 23 nuclear bombs on Bikini Atoll—including one that was more than 1,000 times larger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, per the Guardian. Steve Palumbi calls it "the most destructive thing we have ever done to the ocean." Yet the Stanford marine sciences professor and fellow researchers have found a thriving marine ecosystem in the waters in and around the crater left by the Bikini Atoll nuclear tests. Palumbi says their study—the first looking in-depth at the effects of radiation on marine life—shows marine life is "remarkably resilient." While there are some signs of mutation in nurse sharks in the area, according to USA Today, hundreds of schools of fish are apparently healthy, as are the giant coconut crabs munching on radioactive coconuts. Perhaps most impressive is the coral—some of it as big as cars—which appears to have started growing as soon as a decade after the bombings. The coral shows no signs of being cancerous, and researchers hope learning why that is could potentially help humans fight cancer in the future, the Stanford Daily reports. "The terrible history of Bikini Atoll is an ironic setting for research that might help people live longer," Phys.org quotes Palumbi as saying. The testing on Bikini Atoll rendered it a nuclear wasteland, one that is still unsafe for human habitation, but the bombs may have ultimately helped the coral, fish, and other marine life currently living there. "In a strange way they are protected by the history of this place ... because they have been left alone," Palumbi tells the Guardian. (Now blowing up on YouTube: secret nuclear test footage.)

Story: – A smirking Anders Behring Breivik appeared in court in Oslo today and demanded a medal for the shooting rampage that killed 77 people. Breivik called the people he'd killed at the Labor Party youth camp "traitors" and demanded to be released, the AP reports. The attacks "were preventive attacks on people committing cultural destruction of Norwegian culture and Norwegian ethnicity," he said, according to Reuters. "I acknowledge the acts, but I plead not guilty." "The ethnic Norwegians will be a minority in Oslo in the next 10 years," he went on, reading from prepared remarks. "It is a fact. I represent Norwegian resistance." The remarks came during a custody hearing, which are required periodically to keep Norwegian prisoners in jail. About 100 survivors of the attacks and relatives of its victims were in attendance. "It wasn't good that he got to say what he wanted to say," said one 16-year-old survivor. "It made me irritated."

Story: – President Obama gave himself a grade on fixing the economy—"incomplete"—and Republicans are pouncing on it. Obama offered the grade in an interview with KKTV yesterday, quickly adding that "the steps that we have taken in saving the auto industry, in making sure that college is more affordable, and investing in clean energy and science and technology and research" will all help in the long term. BuzzFeed notes that he gave himself the same grade in 2010 and 2011. Reactions: "Four years into a presidency and an incomplete?" said Paul Ryan on CBS this morning. "I think the incomplete speaks for itself, and that is why I think we are going to win this and get this country on the right track because we're offering solutions." The RNC and Mitt Romney's campaign also reminded reporters that, in 2009, Obama said if he didn't "have this done in three years, then there's going to be a one-term proposition." On Hot Air, an incensed Ed Morrissey writes, "Incomplete? Maybe Professor Obama doesn’t realize this, but report cards come out pretty soon. We’re not going to let him stay after school for extra credit at this point. Obama already flunked his midterms, so unless he’s got a better argument than a demand for an extension, he’s likely to get expelled for academic inadequacy."

Story: – A weakening Hurricane Matthew continued its march along the Atlantic coast Saturday, lashing two of the South's most historic cities and some of its most popular resort islands, flattening trees, swamping streets and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands, the AP reports. According to the AP, it made landfall just southeast of McClellanville, South Carolina, bringing with it a "serious inland flooding event." The storm was blamed for at least four deaths in the US, all in Florida. Matthew raked the Georgia and South Carolina coasts with torrential rain and stiff winds. But for most of its run up the US coastline, its center, or eye, mercifully stayed just far enough offshore that coastal communities didn't feel the full force of its winds. In many communities in the storm's wake, the reaction was relief that it was nowhere near as bad as many feared. At 10am, when Matthew was centered about 30 miles southeast of Charleston, its winds had dropped to 75mph, a Category 1 storm. That was down from 145mph when the storm roared into Haiti. It was moving at 12mph. Among the cities bracing for its effects later in the day were Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. From there, the storm was expected to veer out to sea and loop back around toward the Bahamas, though as a much-weakened storm. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory warned people not to let their guard down just because Matthew was losing steam.

Story: – The Defense Department says it's sending 5,200 active duty troops to "harden" the southern border against a migrant caravan making its way through Mexico, the AP reports. Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy tells reporters that 800 soldiers were en route on Monday and that the remainder of the troops would be at the southwest border by the end of the week. That's in addition to the more than 2,000 members of the National Guard already providing assistance at the border now. Officials say the troops will provide "mission enhancing capabilities" and will be armed. The announcement comes as President Trump has been trying to focus on the caravan just a week before the midterm elections. O’Shaughnessy says the military will cooperate with US Customs and Border Patrol as it first strengthens the border in Texas, then Arizona and California, the Washington Post reports. Among the deployed are US Army Corps of Engineers members, three combat engineer battalions, helicopters with night-vision capabilities to tell the CBP where help is needed, military police units, and cargo aircraft including a C-17 and three C-130s. The Pentagon has already sent down 22 miles of concertina wire and plans to send enough to cover 150 miles. The operation is called Operation Faithful. "Border security is national security," O’Shaughnessy said Monday, per USA Today. (Police blocked the caravan Saturday to try and negotiate a new deal.)

Story: – On Facebook, Mary Ann and Wesley Landers and their two daughters looked like the "picture perfect family," says a friend. Then came "an eye-opener." Mary Ann, 32, was found dead of a suspected heroin overdose in her 7-month-old daughter's room at Cincinnati Children's Hospital around 11:30am on Thursday, reports WTOL. A syringe was still in her arm. Wesley, 31, was found unconscious in a locked bathroom, also with a needle in his arm and a loaded gun in his pocket, though doctors were able to revive him, reports the Cincinnati Enquirer. Only the day before, Wesley had posted a photo of the pair smiling alongside their daughter, who underwent a laryngotracheal reconstruction, per WCPO. Those closest to the couple in their hometown of Trinity, Alabama, say they had no idea either were using drugs. When he last saw the couple, their pastor says "they were very positive and upbeat and just believed God was going to bring their daughter through this." "They're not bad people, they're not bad parents,” a friend says. Mary Ann "was just the sweetest, sweetest girl." Wesley "is a hard worker and he's a good dad," she adds. "If the heroin epidemic has exhibited itself in a more tragic form, I haven't seen it," a judge said in Hamilton County court Friday as Wesley Landers was arraigned on drug and weapons charges. It isn't clear who now has custody of the daughters. (This guy hopes his hospital bed photo will prevent drug abuse.)

Story: – Eric Schmidt didn’t mince words at the D9: All Things Digital conference yesterday, admitting that Google “screwed up” at times during its early social media efforts. Missing out on “the friend thing” and true social functionality was one of his biggest failures, Schmidt admitted during his keynote interview. "In the online world you need to know who you are dealing with," he said. “I clearly knew that I had to do something and I failed to do it." More from his address, via the Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, and Mashable: You can expect more social functionality in future Google products; specifically, users can recommend search results to social contacts through the +1 feature rolling out today. Google Offers, AKA Google’s Groupon competitor, also kicks off today in Portland. Google Offers and Google Wallet, the company’s new payment system, will launch in more cities later this year. The Internet is now dominated by a “gang of four,” Schmidt said: Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. Mashable points out one notable omission from that list: Microsoft. Schmidt later said Microsoft is “not driving the consumer revolution in the minds of consumers.” Another dig at Microsoft? Schmidt noted that if you’re worried about security, “you could get a Mac instead of a PC.”

Story: – A Philadelphia man pretended to be a prince in an elaborate catfishing scheme to get young boys to send them explicit photographs of themselves, according to federal authorities. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported 49-year-old David Milliner pleaded not guilty to child pornography charges during a court hearing Thursday. Prosecutors said Milliner claimed he was a man named Prince Daniel David DeRothschild and used photos of Michael Jackson's nephew, T.J. Jackson, to fool his victims, the AP reports. He claimed that he was a "trillionaire," lived in a mansion and was close friends with Prince, George Clooney and Nicki Minaj, according to prosecutors. "He convinced (his victims) that he was rich and famous," said Assistant US Attorney Michelle Rotella. "And he would never send them photos of his face." Authorities said Milliner used several social media accounts in which he pretended to be members of DeRothschild's entourage to support his claims. He even fabricated a publication, Rich and Royal Magazine, to promote the prince's existence. Milliner convinced at least five boys he met online to send photos of themselves, prosecutors said. Police arrested him in February in the Philadelphia apartment where he lived alone. Milliner faces a minimum of 15 years in prison if convicted. He is in federal custody pending an Oct. 2 trial.

Story: – Organizers have confirmed that a 10-day march from Charlottesville to DC protesting white supremacy will begin Monday, the Hill reports. Per NBC 4, participants will march more than 100 miles over the 10 days, logging roughly 17 miles per day, and stay in churches along the planned route. “We know that this is a very dangerous moment in our nation’s history, a moment that requires action,” march organizers said via a press release, referencing the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville this August. “We are marching to DC in the spirit of love, equality and justice like those before us did in the face of hatred and oppression." Coordinated by a number of activist groups, "The March to Confront White Supremacy” organizers include the Women’s March, Working Families Party, AFL-CIO, and Color of Change. Per the press release, the march’s demands include Trump stepping down from office unless he takes action against the white supremacist movement: “We will demand our country reckon with its long history of white supremacy, that our nation’s leadership side with those of us who will no longer abide it, and we call for the removal of all those, including the president, who refuse to do so.” According to the march’s website, peaceful demonstrations, described as “wave after wave of nonviolent civil disobedience,” will begin when participants arrive in DC on September 6. “This is will be a sustained civil disobedience campaign, so bring what you need to stay,” the website says, indicating that, similar to Occupy Wall Street, the protests do not have a planned end date.

Story: – The Supreme Court has struck down most of Arizona's controversial immigration law in a 5-3 decision, but left intact the so-called "check your papers" provision. The decision struck down the parts of the law that made it a crime for immigrants not to possess federal registration cards, made it a crime for illegal immigrants to apply for work, and that allowed the state to arrest people without a warrant if it had probable cause to believe they were illegal immigrants, USA Today reports. The court did not strike down the controversial provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people arrested for other crimes, but it did leave the door open for future challenges to that provision. "On the net," it was "a significant win for the Obama administration," one SCOTUSBlog liveblogger concluded. "It got almost everything it wanted. Anthony Kennedy wrote the decision, and was joined by John Roberts, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Stephen Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor, according to the Tuscon Sentinel; Elena Kagan recused herself.

Story: – An 82-year-old Colombian woman went to the hospital with abdominal pain and got a diagnosis she almost certainly wasn't expecting: There was a 40-year-old fetus inside her. The condition is known as a "calcified fetus," "lithopaedian," or "stone baby," the Telegraph reports. It's very rare and happens when a fetus implants outside the uterus, cannot be re-absorbed because of its size, and ends up calcifying or "mummifying" as it decays.

Story: – For men who are willing to accompany their wives to the mall but not actually inclined to shop with them, a mall in Shanghai has devised a novel answer: "husband storage" pods replete with retro video games from the 1990s, reports the BBC. The Global Harbor mall currently offers time in the glass rooms for free, but staffers tell the Paper that soon users will have to scan a QR code with their cell phones and pay a nominal fee to enter the gaming zones. A similar idea played out in China in 2010, when "husband cloakrooms" began appearing in malls. They're a bit different, more like rest areas with seats, televisions, and smoking sections, reports Newsweek. For now, the husband storage pods are being well received by the men interviewed, with one calling them "really great" because he'd just played Tekken 3 and "felt like I was back at school!" Another agreed, but noted that without ventilation or air-conditioning, he was "drenched in sweat" just five minutes in. (In the US, nearly half of the gaming population is now female.)

Story: – Serial fans are getting a Christmas present a few days late: Jay, the key witness in the 1999 Baltimore murder of Hae Min Lee and one of the main people around whom the podcast's story centered, has given an extensive interview. Jay, for those who didn't listen to the 12-episode series, is the person who, at 18, told police and the court that he helped his friend Adnan Syed, Lee's 17-year-old ex-boyfriend, dump Lee's body after Syed murdered her. Syed was convicted of the crime and is serving a life sentence, though he's always maintained his innocence; the podcast—a spinoff of This American Life—investigated the question of whether he did it. Host Sarah Koenig was only able to speak to Jay once, and not formally, but now he's given an interview to the Intercept. (Koenig never revealed his last name—it's Wilds.) Highlights from Part 1: Why he's talking: He "feels strongly that he was unfairly depicted by Koenig and that she painted a highly misleading portrayal of him and his role in the case," writes interviewer Natasha Vargas-Cooper. Why he helped Adnan: "At the time I was convinced that I would be going to jail for a long time if he turned me in for drug dealing, especially to high school kids. I was also running [drug] operations from my grandmother's house. So that would ruin her life, too," Jay says, adding that Adnan knew he was scared of that exact thing. He also notes that Baltimore culture played a role: "This is where the 'Stop Snitching' video comes from. ... This is where people would have their house firebombed and still tell the police they knew nothing about it." How he lays out the timeline: He says he and Adnan were ditching last period together when Adnan decided to lend Jay his car and cellphone so Jay could go buy a present for his girlfriend while Adnan went back to school for practice. Later, Adnan calls asking Jay to pick him up at Best Buy, where Adnan tells him he killed Hae, but Jay doesn't see Hae's body or her car. This is between 3pm and 4pm, he says. Jay and Adnan leave the Best Buy to smoke pot at Jay's friend Cathy's house, and after Adnan gets a call from the police, he starts panicking and wants to part ways. He drives off; Jay gets home around 6pm, but at some point Adnan calls from outside Jay's grandma's house and at that point shows Jay Hae's body. After Jay agrees to help, Adnan leaves and comes back hours later. They go to Leakin Park close to midnight, where Jay helps Adnan dig the grave but refuses to touch Hae's body. He also helps Adnan move Hae's car. Why his story has changed over time: He says he wasn't willing to cooperate with police at first, and only became "more transparent" when they told him they weren't interested in prosecuting him over drugs. He also says he wanted to protect his family and friends, so he changed details like seeing Hae's body for the first time in front of his grandma's house. Click to read the full interview. No word yet on when Part 2 will be posted.
Summary: 1. What motivated Jay to give this interview now, after all these years, and how did he feel about the way he was portrayed in the Serial podcast?2. Can you elaborate on why you helped Adnan Syed, and how did you convince him to dump Hae Min Lees body? What was the reasoning behind your decision?3. You mentioned that Baltimore culture played a role in your decision to help Adnan. Can you elaborate on what you mean by that, and how does it relate to the "Stop Snitching" mentality?4.

Story: – Hundreds of thousands of passengers on their way to family holiday festivities in Europe were camped out instead yesterday at mobbed airports and train stations shut down by record snow and cold. London's Heathrow Airport was largely closed for a second day as wanna-be fliers huddled under emergency blankets on trash-strewn floors, some of them for a third night waiting for their plane to take off. "It's very hard," a passenger with a ticket to Dallas told CNN. "All I want for Christmas is to hug my daughter." Charles De Gaulle and German airports canceled more than a quarter of their flights, and several Eurostar trips were delayed or ditched. Road travel was also hazardous in record snowfalls and cold, with more dire weather predicted in the coming days. Even Lady Gaga couldn't trump the weather. A Paris concert was cancelled when her 28 tour trucks were detained by police because of dangerous road conditions. "Two of my employees were arrested trying to get into Paris so we could perform," Gaga tweeted yesterday. "I am furious and devastated. It's unfair to my fans and to me. I'm sorry little monsters."

Story: – Joining 16 of his fellow House Democrats, Massachusetts Rep. William Delahunt says he will not seek re-election this fall. “It’s got nothing to do with politics,” Delahunt, 68, tells the Boston Globe. “It’s time.” And while Delahunt had to be talked into seeking re-election in 2008 by his friend, the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, the Globe notes that his district voted most lopsidedly for Republican Scott Brown in the January election to fill Kennedy’s seat. And while Republicans see another golden opportunity in what was once a solidly Democratic state, the Dems look to have a number of strong candidates in the wings. One, the AP reported last week, is Joseph P. Kennedy III, a 29-year-old grandson of onetime Democratic presidential nominee Robert F. Kennedy.

Story: – President Trump returned to one of his favorite recent themes on Tuesday, complaining about a "caravan" of immigrants in Mexico moving toward the US border. "The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets there," Trump tweeted.

Story: – Want a free, all-expenses-paid, six-month-long trip to the Caribbean? Well, if you're a qualified physical therapist or orthopedic surgeon, you just might be in luck. Professional kite surfer Jeremie Tronet lives in the Grenadines island chain with his girlfriend, Zoe, who recently fell and broke her femur. She had surgery to fix it, but she needs to stay off it for two months and will then need to be rehabilitated. The couple don't have health insurance, so the physical therapy she'll need would be quite pricey, AOL reports. Zoe would also have to travel to Martinique for the entire five- to six-month course of therapy. So Tronet had an idea: Convince a therapist to come to her. He made the offer earlier this month on his Facebook page and his website, informing interested parties that their travel, food, accommodations, and other expenses would be covered—and they can bring along a plus-one, the Penny Hoarder reports. Plus, they can take free kite-surfing lessons and fun excursions, Yahoo News reports. "We are very happy to see the story being share[d] by everyone as we hope it will inspire a lot of people in thinking positive what ever happens in life," reads a follow-up post on Tronet's Facebook page, which also notes that the couple are hearing from hundreds of people per day and haven't yet decided who will come help Zoe out. If you still want to take a shot, send your resume and a photo to zoesurgery@gmail.com, the Mirror reports. (You could also try to win a chance to use the Eiffel Tower as a vacation home.)

Story: – The G20 summit may not be much fun for Donald Trump, what with the angry protesters making noise between his possibly difficult meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin. But he'll have a bit of a buffer beforehand as he first visits Poland, where he's expected to receive a warm welcome from the country's right-wing, populist government when he arrives late Wednesday, reports the BBC. It's no surprise why: The governing Law and Justice Party is in line with the Trump administration on major issues, "from immigration to global warming and coal mining," reports the New York Times. The party also sees Trump's visit as "tacit approval for its policies," which have been heavily criticized by the European Union, per USA Today. While Poland is taking a conservative approach to abortion and gay rights, it's the country's apparent attempts to curb opposition—by using state-owned media as a government puppet and pushing a law that would alter how judges are selected—that have most irked critics. To prevent an assumption of Trump's endorsement, critics hope Trump will reference these concerns during a speech in Warsaw on Thursday. So far, however, there's no indication he will. National Security Adviser HR McMaster says Trump will "celebrate Poland's emergence as a European power" and discuss "America's future relationship with Europe." Also Thursday, Trump will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda and other Central European leaders at the Three Seas Initiative summit.

Story: – Georgia's Shorter University wants to know what's happening in its workers' bedrooms. The conservative Christian university is demanding that its 200 employees sign a "Personal Lifestyle Statement" rejecting homosexuality, adultery, and premarital sex, the New York Daily News reports. Those who don't sign the pledge face losing their jobs. "I think that anybody that adheres to a lifestyle outside of what the biblical mandate is would not be allowed to continue here," the school's president says. The pledge also bans teachers and administrators from drinking alcohol in the presence of students and requires them to be active in local churches. Students aren't required to sign the statement but many of them, as well as some employees, are upset about the pledge, a university employee tells the Georgia Voice. "We now will live in fear that someone who doesn't like us personally or someone who has had a bad day will report that we've been drinking or that we are suspected of being gay," he says.

Story: – Despite the five Senate Republicans who voted against Paul Ryan’s Medicare overhaul yesterday, the GOP remains wedded to the divisive, and increasingly unpopular, plan. Rather than back off, Republicans are responding by increasing attacks on the Democrats’ position, the Wall Street Journal reports. "We need to make it a choice between a do-nothing approach that will ultimately destroy Medicare, and life-saving reforms," says Rep. Tom Cole. Though the Democrats’ upset win in New York implies that the issue could have a big impact on future elections, Rep. Cliff Stearns insists it’s simply "a wake-up call on how you frame it. It obviously wasn't framed right.” But Democrats, even as they celebrated the New York win and its implications, were also starting to realize they will need to engage in talks about Medicare’s future, the Washington Post reports. Before the vote, Bill Clinton urged Congress not to “tippy-toe around” the issue, noting that Democrats shouldn’t mine the topic simply for political gain: “We’ve got to deal with these things.” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer acknowledged Medicare “needs to be on the table,” but would not suggest concrete changes since “that is the same mistake that … [Paul] Ryan made,” illustrating the Dems’ reluctance to propose new ideas and alternatives to Ryan’s plan.

Story: – Scientists have been anticipating this milestone for a while, but they won't be breaking out the champagne now that it's here: Carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere passed the mark of 400 parts per million yesterday for the first time in human history, reports the BBC. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made the declaration based on readings of the heat-trapping gas at a station on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii. (Another monitoring program run by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography hasn't quite gotten to 400 yet, but it supports the NOAA figure and chalks up the difference to a technicality.) A few reactions: New York Times: It's "just an odometer moment in one sense, but also a sobering reminder that decades of efforts to bring human-produced emissions under control are faltering." National Geographic: "The last time the concentration of CO2 was as high as 400 ppm was probably in the Pliocene Epoch, between 2.6 and 5.3 million years ago. Until the 20th century, it certainly hadn't exceeded 300 ppm, let alone 400 ppm, for at least 800,000 years." “It symbolizes that so far we have failed miserably in tackling this problem,” says the NOAA's Pieter P. Tans.

Story: – China has declared the first rover mission to the moon in more than 40 years a "complete success," with the first photos sent back from its Jade Rabbit rover, the BBC reports. The rover—photographed by the lander after it separated from the vehicle yesterday—sent back color photos of the lander as the nation's leaders waited in the Beijing Aerospace Control Center. The 300-pound rover will soon begin its mission to gather data and scout for mineral resources that could someday be mined. China's leaders—who hailed the successful landing as a "new glory" for China and an "outstanding contribution" to humanity's peaceful use of space—are already looking ahead to future moon missions, the AP finds. The Chang'e 3 lander's mission will be followed by a Chang'e 4 to do more research and a Chang'e 5 in 2017 to bring back lunar soil and rock samples—and pave the way for sending a Chinese astronaut to the moon sometime after 2020.

Story: – What a museum worker calls an "amazing story" has emerged out of the south of Sweden, where a 1,500-year-old sword from the Iron Age was found in a lake—not by archaeologists or maritime researchers, but by an 8-year-old from Minneapolis. NPR reports on Saga Vanecek's discovery in July, made as she crawled on her hands and knees in the shallow waters of Lake Vidostern. Accustomed to bumping into rocks and sticks as she played in the lake, Saga instead stumbled on an object in the mud with a handle. "She picked up the object, lifted it high above her head, and shouted as if she was Pippi Longstocking, 'DADDY! I FOUND A SWORD!'" her dad, Andy Vanecek, said in a Wednesday Facebook post, adding it's the "first sword of its kind to ever be found in Scandinavia." The BBC notes the water level in the lake was low due to drought, which made it easier for Saga to find the sword. An expert from a local museum, which shows a pic of the "exceptionally preserved" sword, says the weapon is about 33 inches long and came in a wood-and-leather sheath. "Why it has come to be [in the lake], we don't know," the expert tells the Local, via NPR. "But perhaps it's a place of sacrifice." Also found by researchers, who swore Saga and her family to secrecy until now so the site wouldn't be overrun by amateur excavators: a brooch from around the same time period as the sword, as well as an 18th-century coin, per MPR. Saga's dad is pretty excited, noting, "I'm a huge Minnesota Vikings fan, and this looks just like a Viking sword." As for Saga, who moved to Sweden with her family in 2017, the Guardian notes some have dubbed her the country's "true queen" for her find. "All hail! Queen Saga! Lady Vanecek of ... Vidostern!" one acolyte tweeted.

Calling Friess "Strong on Crime, Borders & 2nd Amendment," Trump had endorsed the candidate in a tweet as voting got underway Tuesday, the AP reports. "This is a governor's race. This is about the state of Wyoming," Gordon said after winning his six-way primary. "President Trump is doing great things that are important for Wyoming ... But in the end, I think people in Wyoming concentrated on who's got the experience, who's got the record, and who's got the best message going forward for Wyoming."

Story: – A Georgia man accused of murdering his son by leaving him in a sweltering hot car is up on new charges: sexually exploiting minors, People reports. Justin Ross Harris, whose 22-month-old son Cooper died in the back of an SUV in 2014, was indicted Friday by a grand jury on six counts of disseminating harmful material to a minor and two counts of sexually exploiting children. He's accused of exchanging lewd and nude photos with underage girls and having sexually explicit conversations with them in months prior to Cooper's death, NBC News reports. But Harris attorney H. Maddox Kilgore says the charges were timed to malign Harris just before his murder trial begins on April 11. The indictment was filed "to inflame public opinion against Ross on the eve of jury selection," says Kilgore, who calls the allegations "wholly unrelated to the accidental death of Cooper Harris." Yet the original indictment also charges Harris with sending inappropriate texts to underage girls—part of the state's case that he purposely murdered Cooper to free himself of family obligations. Cobb District Attorney Vic Reynolds says the timing of new charges couldn't be avoided, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. "Had the state delayed charging any further, prosecution of some of the charges would have barred by the statute of limitations," he says. Harris will be tried on the new charges separately. (Harris could face the death penalty.)

Story: – Two years ago, Boris Berian was a college dropout working at McDonald's. He now hopes to run for Team USA at the Olympics, but first he has to clear a major hurdle: a lawsuit from Nike. And he wants your help. The world champion in the indoor 800-meter is hoping to crowdfund what his agent calls a "David vs. Goliath battle" after Nike sued him in May over a sponsorship agreement, per BuzzFeed. Nike finished a seven-month contract with Berian in December but reserved the right to match rival offers until June 28, in which case Nike would emerge the victor. When New Balance offered Berian a three-year contract worth $375,000 plus bonuses, Nike says it matched it. But the Nike deal included clauses that would've cut his pay by up to 50% if he didn't meet certain performance standards, reports OregonLive. Nike says such clauses are standard practice. Berian, New Balance, and others in the industry disagree. The lawsuit notes Berian's breach of contract "will cause irreparable harm to Nike," which has thus far prevented Berian from signing with New Balance, whose sneakers he says he prefers and has been training in. "To force him to wear some other brand at this point would be incredibly unfair," says his agent, Hawi Keflezighi. Now the athlete is earning nothing in "the peak of his earnings potential" and must pay an expected $25,000 in legal fees when he has had only "a little bit of income to support himself for the last several months," Keflezighi says, writing, "This case has a chance to be a landmark case in athlete's rights." Support for Berian is growing online using the hashtag #FreeBoris. A decision is expected next Wednesday, two days before Berian will compete in the 800-meter race at the US Olympic trials, per the Denver Post. About $3,300 has been raised as of this writing.

Story: – Looks like Windows 8 is doing little to reboot the market when it comes to laptops and desktops. Global shipments of the machines plummeted 14% in Q1 compared to the year prior, analysts at IDC say, marking the largest drop since its tracking began in 1994. The figures have been cruising downward for four quarters, the firm says. Research rival Gartner saw a slightly smaller drop of 11.2%—still the biggest it has seen since 2001, the Wall Street Journal reports. "The interesting question is how much of this is a structural shift toward slower replacement cycles and more tablets versus how much is people disliking Windows 8," writes Matthew Yglesias at Slate. "The reaction to Windows 8 is real," says an analyst with IDC, which actually assigns some of the slowdown blame to the OS, whose features it describes as confusing to consumers familiar with the traditional PC experience. Further, businesses aren't scrambling to upgrade, he notes. A Gartner analyst, however, believes Windows 8 is "the right direction," and just needs time. Outside the Windows world, analysts had contradictory numbers: Apple's domestic shipments sank 7.5%, according to IDC; Gartner says they climbed 7.4%. (In related news, the Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft is working on a 7-inch Surface tablet to compete with the iPad Mini and Google's 7-inch Nexus.)

Story: – A reportedly pregnant St. Louis woman who says she was simply "respecting Mike Brown" is blind in her left eye and can't see well out of her right eye after a police officer shot a round of beanbags at the car she was riding in, KMOV reports. Dornnella Conner says she and boyfriend De'Angelas Lee were trying to leave a Ferguson gas station where protests were taking place Tuesday morning when cops pulled up. Conner says they were "blocked" in and that Lee was just trying to get around one of the squad cars when an officer blasted a round of beanbags, smashing the front passenger window and injuring Conner. Another police officer on the scene helped Conner get medical attention, while Lee drove away. "I didn't have any weapons. I wasn't looting or anything," Conner tells the TV station. "I was just out with my boyfriend and we was just riding around just respecting Mike Brown." Police dispute her account, saying that Lee drove directly toward them (not around them), and that the officer who shot the beanbags feared for his own safety; an arrest warrant for Lee has been issued with a $50,000 bond. Meanwhile, Conner's father, Donnell, wants to know how anyone could seriously think his daughter could have been a threat that warranted that type of police action. "I'm very upset, very disappointed with the tactics that they used," he tells KMOV. "I understand they have a tough job, I understand that it was chaos. … But how can a pregnant person, in a car in a seat belt, be causing chaos?" Conner herself yesterday posted on Facebook, "I will have [justice] for what they did [to] me but [I'm] happy [I'm] alive." (A woman died after she accidentally shot herself with a gun she bought to prepare for Ferguson protests.)

How long had they been ongoing, and what were the initial causes of the protests?2. How did Dornnella Conner and her boyfriend DeAngelas Lee become involved in the protests? Did they attend the protests regularly, or were they just passing by when the incident occurred?3. Can you describe the events leading up to the police officer shooting the beanbags at their car? Did the officer give any warning before firing, or did he just open fire without warning?4. How did Dornnella Conner sustain injuries to her eyes? Did she receive medical attention immediately after the incident, and if so, what kind of treatment did she receive?5. The police have disputed Conner's account of the incident, saying that Lee drove directly towards them instead of around them. How does Conner explain this discrepancy in their accounts?6. What was the condition of the other police officers on the scene during the incident? Did they witness the shooting of the beanbags, or did they arrive after the fact?7. How did Conner's father, Donnell, react to the incident? What did he say to KMOV, and what does he think about the police action?8. What is the current status of the arrest warrant for Lee? Has he been arrested or is he still at large?9. How does Conner feel about the incident and the police action? Does she plan to pursue legal action, and if so, what kind of legal action?10. What message does Conner want to convey to the public about her experience? Does she have any advice for others who may find themselves in similar situations?
Story: – She's referred to as "the Black Widow of the Riviera" (not to be confused with the Black Widow of Japan), and now she has a prison sentence to go with that title. Patricia Dagorn was sentenced this week to 22 years for murdering two men and poisoning two more. The victims ranged in age from 60s to 91, and were said to be some of the at least 20 elderly men the 57-year-old met between 2011 and 2012 through a dating agency, online ads, and even on the street, reports the Guardian. The BBC explains that Dagorn had previously been handed a five-year sentence for fraud and theft, and in the wake of that trial, French authorities decided to take a second look at Michel Kneffel's July 2011 death; Dagorn had lived with him in Nice, and police reportedly discovered Valium and the financial and medical info of a number of men among her things. What they uncovered led them to look at Francesco Filippone, an 85-year-old whose decomposed body was found in his tub in February 2011. Ange Pisciotta, 82, and Robert Vaux, 91, had dalliances with Dagorn but survived, with Vaux describing the much younger woman as "like a ray of sunshine in winter." Though after she began to live with him in 2012, his health took a major turn; Dagorn had allegedly drugged him with Valium. Prosecutors painted her as a serial poisoner who covertly used drugs to weaken her marks and then, per the AFP, get the men to give her money (she cashed a $25,000 check from Filippone) or put her in their wills. Dagorn denied the charges against her, and said at trial, "I won't say that [what she felt toward the men] was love, but it was deep friendship." (Japan's black widow received a much more severe sentence.)
Summary: 1. Who is Patricia Dagorn, and what is she known as?2. What were the charges brought against Dagorn, and how long was her prison sentence?3. How did Dagorn meet her victims, and what were their ages?4. What evidence did French authorities discover when they investigated Dagorn's home?5. How did Dagorn's alleged actions harm her victims, according to prosecutors?6. How did Dagorn describe her relationships with her victims during the trial?7.

What does this case highlight about the vulnerability of elderly individuals to manipulation and exploitation?These questions can help you delve deeper into the details of the article and gain a better understanding of the case, as well as the broader implications and themes involved.
Story: – The claim to take with a grain of salt: Steve Jobs may have just 6 weeks to live, says the National Enquirer. The claim that seems a little more backed up: Jobs was spotted leaving the same California clinic where actor Patrick Swayze sought treatment for cancer in his final days, as evidenced by photos (not yet online) the Enquirer took, reports Radar. The Enquirer showed its photos, which reportedly depict a gaunt Jobs, to two doctors, both of whom described the Apple CEO's condition as near-terminal (without having seen him in person, of course). "Judging from the photos, he is close to terminal. I would say he has 6 weeks," one critical care physician said. He is emaciated and looks to have lost a lot of muscle mass, which spells a poor prognosis." A source who claims to have recently seen Jobs told the tabloid: "He is very frail, moving like a weak, feeble old man. He weaves back and forth when he walks, as if he is having trouble keeping his balance." Worth noting: Jobs is apparently well enough to meet with President Obama and other Silicon Valley leaders today in California.

What are the broader implications of the Enquirer's report for the public perception of Steve Jobs and his legacy, and how might it affect his personal and professional reputation?
Story: – Scientists are documenting "sexual coercion" in the Antarctic, and it's probably not anything like what one might think: Young male Antarctic fur seals, it seems, have been documented having sex with King penguins of undetermined gender, reports the BBC, via a study in the journal Polar Biology. Scientists observed a male seal unsuccessfully attempting to mate with a penguin in 2006, but dismissed it as a one-off. But researchers says they inadvertently observed the same thing on at least three separate occasions. "Honestly I did not expect that follow-up sightings of a similar nature to that 2006 one would ever be made again, and certainly not on multiple occasions," says a study co-author. It's believed to be the first instances of pinnipeds—which include seals, fur seals, and sea lions—having sex across biological classes, as the BBC notes, "in this case a mammal trying to have sex with a bird." Some of the seals are believed to have penetrated the penguins, and one instance turned bloody, with the seal killing and eating his victim, though that's not unusual. It's not clear what's driving the behavior, though scientists speculate that it's a learned behavior; that would explain the increase in sightings. "I genuinely think the behavior is increasing in frequency," says the co-author. Other theories include the seals blowing off sexual frustration, or using the weaker birds to practice. "All in all it's difficult to say really," says the co-author. (Meanwhile, a study previously revealed that penguins are pretty sexually depraved themselves.)
Summary: 1. What is the frequency of this behavior among young male Antarctic fur seals, and how does it compare to other species of pinnipeds?2. What are the possible reasons behind this behavior, according to the scientists' speculations? Are there any other theories that could explain the observed phenomenon?3.

How does this discovery challenge or support existing theories about the evolution of sexual behavior in different species? Could it provide insights into the origins of human sexuality and mating behaviors?6. What are the ethical considerations of studying this behavior, particularly when it involves the interaction of different species? How can scientists ensure that their research is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner?7. How can this discovery be used to inform conservation efforts in the Antarctic region? Are there any potential threats to the survival of the affected species, and how can scientists work to mitigate those threats?8. What are the potential implications of this discovery for our understanding of sexuality and sexual behavior in general? Could it lead to a reevaluation of our assumptions about the boundaries between different species and their sexual behaviors?9. How does this discovery fit into the broader context of scientific research on sexuality and reproduction? Are there any other areas of research that could benefit from a closer examination of this phenomenon?10. Finally, what are the broader implications of this discovery for society as a whole? Could it lead to any changes in our attitudes towards sexuality and the boundaries between different species?
Story: – Edward Snowden says he hopes international pressure will persuade the US government to stop "persecuting" him with espionage charges but he appears to have as much hope of receiving clemency as he does of getting his old job back. The NSA leaker "violated US law," White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer says. "He should return to the US and face justice." Snowden released a manifesto yesterday denouncing mass surveillance and saying that telling the truth shouldn't be considered a crime, NBC reports. "We have a moral duty to ensure that our laws and values limit surveillance programs and protect human rights," Snowden wrote. But the White House's rejection of clemency was backed by the leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees, with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein accusing Snowden of doing an "enormous disservice to our country," reports the Guardian. For now, Snowden will remain in Russia, where has been granted temporary asylum and reportedly started a new job. A major Russian website that offered Snowden a job earlier this year says he isn't working for them and other leading Internet firms also deny having him on the payroll, the Wall Street Journal notes.

Story: – The Kellogg Company says producing quality food is "of the utmost importance"—a sentiment apparently ignored by the guy who urinated on a conveyor belt at one of its plants. A video of the act filmed by the man himself and recently posted to a viral video site has prompted a criminal investigation by the FDA, WREG reports. In a statement, a "shocked and deeply disappointed" Kellogg says that it determined the incident occurred in 2014 at its plant in Memphis, Tenn. Potentially affected products (now long expired) include Rice Krispies Treats, Rice Krispies Treats cereal, and puffed rice cake products. The video, WREG notes, was shot during a period in which Kellogg and the workers union were in the midst of a nasty labor dispute. Kellogg says it informed law enforcement and began its own internal investigation as soon as it got wind of the posted video. One consumer interviewed by WMC calls the man in the video "nasty, low down, dirty," adding, "He should go to jail. Go straight to jail." Kellogg pledges to "work closely with authorities to prosecute to the full extent of the law." (A McDonald's customer got an unwelcome surprise in an order of french fries.)

Story: – Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson was hit in the face with a pie Wednesday night—and there wasn't a clown in sight. The former NBA star was a guest at a fundraising event when a man wielding the pie lunged at Johnson, landing it smack in his face, reports the East Bay Express. Johnson tackled the man and punched him repeatedly, witnesses tell the newspaper. (The police mug shot, in the photo gallery, bears that out.) Cops arrested Sean Thompson, 32, at the event at Sacramento Charter High School, and he was taken to a hospital with minor injuries. Thompson, who was charged with felony assault of a public official, is a member of Occupy San Francisco, notes Heavy. He was arrested at a protest in 2011, per the Sacramento City Express. About 200 people, including some of the city's top restaurateurs, saw the incident unfold around 6:40pm as Johnson attended a Seeds of HOPE dinner on behalf of "food literacy." His chief of staff said the assault was no joke. "I was standing right there, and I'm still pretty shaken up," she said, per AP. The two-term Johnson, who is not running for reelection, thanked the police on Twitter. "Appreciate everyone. I'm doing fine," he wrote. "Be safe everyone." Police did not comment on why the mayor was targeted, but the East Bay Express said protesters have followed him since a decades-old sexual abuse claim reemerged last year. Johnson, who played with the Phoenix Suns at the time, was never charged in the case.

(e.g. Have there been any protests, etc.)These questions can help you gain a deeper understanding of the article and the events that occurred.
Story: – Critics are pretty disappointed with Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief. The Harry Potter-esque romp, directed by Chris Columbus, follows a boy who discovers not just that he has powers, but that the Greek gods are alive in America. The film "has no real pep to it as Columbus moves from one special-effects sequence to the next, and as an effects film it is perhaps the first clear casualty in a post-Avatar world: Everything looks somewhat cheesy," writes Tom Long for the Detroit News. Rick Groen of the Globe and Mail calls Percy Jackson a "Potter knock-off right down to that mouthful of a title." The flick "has all the CGI sorcery of a Harry Potter pic, but none of the magic," Adam Markovitz writes for Entertainment Weekly. At least one viewer finds Percy somewhat enjoyable: Columbus "has brought together the modern and mythical spheres with sharp pacing and a nifty sense of fun that atone for the film's dippier moments," writes Amy Biancolli for the Houston Chronicle.

Story: – Chinese government hackers broke into the unclassified computer network of a Navy contractor in January and February and accessed 614 gigabytes of technological information about a submarine-based missile known as Sea Dragon, as well other highly sensitive classified data, reports the Washington Post. Sea Dragon is a $300 million project scheduled for underwater testing in September. In recent years, the Pentagon has ramped up investment in technologies capable of sinking enemy ships in response to a resurgence in China's and Russia’s forces at sea. The Chinese have hacked US military information before. They obtained plans for, among others, the patriot PAC-3 missile system, the F-35 joint strike fighter, and a system for shooting down ballistic missiles, according to the Post. The theft has raised questions about the Navy’s handling of contractors, particularly those working on high-tech weapons. The US protects its secrets using “highly compartmented security systems,” says retired admiral James Stavridis. When one of those is hacked, “you give up an enormous advantage in surprise.” The report comes at a tricky time in US-China relations. The White House is seeking Beijing’s help in negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear weapons, while at the same time sparring with China over trade and China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, reports the Hill.

Story: – Kim Jong Un has made his first known trip abroad since becoming North Korea's leader in 2011—and it wasn't to Mar-a-Lago. After days of rumors sparked by the arrival of a mysterious North Korean train in Beijing, Chinese and North Korean officials have confirmed that Kim met China's President Xi Jinping for talks, arriving Sunday and leaving Tuesday, the BBC reports. According to state-run media in China, the leaders held "successful talks" in which Kim promised to proceed with denuclearization as long as the US and South Korea "respond to our efforts with goodwill." Analysts say the trip, described by North Korean media as a "milestone," appears to have been a "courtesy visit" ahead of expected North Korean talks with President Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. China, after months of strained relations, "was getting concerned it could be left out of any initial political agreements that Moon and Kim or Trump and Kim could come to," Michael Kovrig at the International Crisis Group tells the AP. "This is China asserting its regional hegemony and influence, saying: 'Hey, you talk to me first.'" Reuters notes that even if progress is made with denuclearization, Pyongyang may find it difficult to convince the public the move is necessary after decades of propaganda stating the opposite. Analysts say that if a deal is reached, the country is likely to make getting rid of its nuclear weapons a slow, incremental process that happens as sanctions are lifted and its economy improves. They say Pyongyang is likely to portray any deal as an American and South Korean "surrender."

What are the implications of North Korea's incremental approach to denuclearization, and how might this impact the broader geopolitical landscape in the region?7. How might China's support for North Korea's denuclearization efforts impact its own relations with the United States and other regional actors, and what are the potential risks or benefits of this support?8. What are the potential next steps in the denuclearization process, and how might they be coordinated between North Korea, the United States, and other regional actors?9. How might the success or failure of denuclearization efforts impact the stability of the region, and what are the potential implications for the future of North Korea and its relations with neighboring countries?10. What are the broader implications of Kim Jong Un's trip abroad for the future of North Korea's political and economic development, and how might these developments impact the region's security landscape?
Story: – A second major terrorist attack in the space of 24 hours has shaken the Russian city of Volgograd, less than six weeks before the start of the Sochi Olympics. Authorities say at least 14 people were killed in an apparent suicide attack on an electric trolleybus close to a hospital where victims of yesterday's suicide attack in a railway station were being treated, the Guardian reports, describing a "disfigured" bus left without a roof or walls. Another 41 have been injured, reports RT. Officials say they believe the two attacks are linked, though no group has claimed responsibility. But the Guardian notes that security experts are drawing a link between the attacks—which now number three in three months—to Chechen jihadist leader Doku Umarov, who has vowed to interfere with the Games. RT notes a Volgograd basketball game scheduled for next Monday has pre-emptively been canceled over security fears.

Story: – As a company that hopes to rocket passengers into space and colonize other planets, you might expect SpaceX to run some unusual help-wanted ads from time to time. But a new one is definitely raising eyebrows: Elon Musk's company is looking for an experienced farmer in Texas. Applicants should have a "minimum of 10 years of row crop farming experience" and be handy with John Deere equipment, notes the Christian Science Monitor. So what gives? SpaceX isn't saying, leading to speculation that the company hopes to send a farmer to space someday to sow seeds on an another planet. But Agriculture.com suspects the reason is far more mundane: tax breaks. It notes that SpaceX could get agriculture-use exemptions for both land and equipment. (That makes sense, given Musk's ability to extract cash out of state coffers.)

Story: – People are continuing to get sick from a nasty parasitic infection the CDC has linked to McDonald's salads, UPI reports. The number of people hit with the Cyclospora parasite rose to 436 this week, up from 395 last week, with cases clustering in the Midwest (Illinois especially) and spreading across 15 states. Twenty or more people have been hospitalized with symptoms including nausea, stomach cramps, diarrhea, bloating, and flu-like reactions, but no fatalities so far. "Epidemiologic evidence indicates that salads purchased from McDonald’s restaurants are one likely source of these infections," said the CDC in an outbreak update Thursday. Seems the infected salad fixings came from the Fresh Express processor in Streamwood, Illinois, in the form of romaine lettuce and carrots. The carrots went only to McDonald's locations, while the romaine was also shipped elsewhere and ended up in wraps and pre-made salads by Caito Foods. The feds advise people to watch out for Caito products with "Sell by" or "Best by" dates from July 18 to July 23, 2018 (see sample product labels here). Anyone who develops diarrhea after eating any of the above is advised to see a healthcare provider right away and get tested for Cyclospora.

Story: – Archeologists have shown "beyond a reasonable doubt" that human remains under a Leicester parking lot belong to a fabled king of England. Researchers had suspected the skeleton was Richard III's—and today they announced that DNA and other testing have confirmed it, the Guardian reports. The skeleton's DNA matches that of a descendant of Richard's sister, while wounds and a curved spine make the theory "highly convincing," a researcher says. So what's next for the skeleton? It's set to be reinterred in Leicester Cathedral, which will feature an exhibit about the king. Though he was "the most notorious villain in English history," perhaps his burial deserves as much attention as William and Kate's wedding, writes Ed West in the Telegraph. After all, "nationhood ultimately is a story," and Richard was a central part of it. "A day to bury our former king would be a great moment of togetherness. I hope that the queen ... can make it." The BBC has a slideshow of the find.

Story: – People who suffer from depression but are happily in love—perhaps an odd combination—may want to think twice about popping certain antidepressants, LiveScience reports. In a new study, researchers gave two kinds of antidepressants to 192 people who were depressed but in healthy relationships for at least seven months. "Indeed, our subjects were those who could be properly considered smitten by love," says study author Hagop Akiskal. The participants—69 men and 123 women, with a mean age of 41—filled out questionnaires saying how their feelings of attraction, attachment, and love toward their partner changed after taking the drugs. What they found: Participants taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were more likely to be uncomfortable with "sharing their partners' thoughts and feelings," reports LiveScience, and less hopeful that their love would endure, than those taking taking the other kind—tricyclic antidepressants. Men taking SSRIs were less inclined to ask for advice or help from their partners than women taking SSRIs. Women taking tricyclic antidepressants saw more negative effects on their sex lives than men taking the same drug. "The good news is that there are a variety of agents for treating depression," says Akiskal. Meanwhile, antidepressant consumption has been rising worldwide for the past decade, reports the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in an article that looks at who is using the drugs and why. Teenagers in the US, however, are taking fewer antidepressants—perhaps too few—since an FDA warning about possible suicide risks in 2004, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. (But here's some good news for pregnant women taking antidepressants.)

How does the study's findings relate to the broader issue of depression and its treatment, and what are the implications for mental health professionals and patients?
Story: – President Obama has disappointed a slew of environmental activists by giving Shell the green light yesterday to drill deeper in the Arctic for oil, Quartz reports. The approval issued by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement expands the oil company's current permissions, allowing it to drill even further down into the Chukchi Sea after proper safety gear was installed, the Hill reports. But the decision is being decried by already active critics as the president's trip to Alaska to talk about climate change looms later this month. Greenpeace USA's executive director calls the move "deeply hypocritical," per Politico. "President Obama should know better—Shell has no business in our Arctic Ocean, and he will bear responsibility for the damage that Shell wreaks there," a rep for Friends of the Earth says, while the executive director of the Sierra Club adds the decision "goes against science, the will of the people and common sense," per the Hill. An April Reuters article proffered theories why this may be happening: For one, onshore shale oil production may start to fall off in a few decades, and it may take that long to build up sufficient reserves of Arctic oil. Energy companies could also reap the benefits of lower-emissions gas in the region, and the president may be able to gain a strategic advantage over Russia and China by starting now. A Shell rep tells Politico: "We remain committed to operating in a safe, environmentally responsible manner and look forward to evaluating what could potentially become a national energy resource base." That's not swaying environmentalists. "President Obama is willing to allow the pristine Chukchi Sea to become an energy sacrifice zone," the Friends of the Earth rep says, per Quartz. (A New York Times writer likens the decision to "tobacco companies … applying for permission to put cigarette machines in cancer wards.")

Story: – It's a natural food and adherents swear by its health benefits, even if they're not too keen to go public about it. The headline at New York should tell you why: "Meet the Men Who Drink Breast Milk." This seems to be a trend, if the increase in guys looking to buy the stuff online at sites such as Only the Breast is any guide. Here's a typical quote in the story, from a man identified as Anthony who happily pays $2.50 an ounce: "It gives me incredible energy I don’t get from other food and drinks." But he adds later that he doesn't exactly advertise his habit for fear of sounding a little "weird." Most of the guys in the piece say they're in it for the nutrition, though the medical community is by and large skeptical that human breast milk confers any real benefits to grown men, writes Chavie Lieber. At least one quoted in the story admits he's into it for the "kink" factor. Those curious enough to try might take heed of a New York Times story from last year about a study concluding that 64% of breast milk sold at popular online sites is tainted with staph. Or they can opt for breast milk cheese instead.

How does the consumption of breast milk by men challenge or reinforce traditional gender roles and expectations?9. What are some potential ethical considerations surrounding the consumption of breast milk, particularly in the context of a capitalist economy where breast milk is being sold and marketed as a product?10. How does the text raise questions about the boundaries between food, medicine, and sexuality, and how do these categories intersect in the context of men consuming breast milk?
Story: – Jon Stewart again smacked Fox News for its fury over Common’s White House appearance, pointing out last night that only huffers of “Foxygen”—“the heady mix of partisan hackery, character assassination, and manufactured outrage”—would be bothered by the rapper’s performance. From there, Stewart attacked Newt Gingrich’s attempt to “hook up with the new generation,” as CNN’s John King put it, by using Twitter and YouTube to announce his presidential candidacy. Stewart warned Newt: “This whole Twitter thing is not going to work for you, because you’re not cool. You’re what might be known to your generation as a square.” Meanwhile, Bill O’Reilly defended Fox News in response to Stewart's takedown of the network on Wednesday, saying that the organization doesn’t mind Common’s "style." "What we object to is that Common is sticking up for two convicted police killers. It is incredible that the White House would honor a man who has that on his resume." Glenn Beck weighed in, too, suggesting that Common’s White House invitation “clearly indicates” that the president is “anti-cop."

Story: – More than 2,000 former NFL players will file the largest sports lawsuit in history today, combining their various concussion-related complaints against the league. The suit claims that the "NFL exacerbated the health risk by promoting the game's violence" and "deliberately and fraudulently" hid the danger of long-term brain injury from players, according to ABC News. It also accuses the league's media arm of helping by "mythologizing" the violence of the sport. The suit seeks to make the league handle medical monitoring and treatment for its retirees, the AP reports. It combines 81 previously filed lawsuits, which together included 3,356 plaintiffs, including 2,138 players. The rest of the plaintiffs are family members, like Mary Ann Easterling, whose husband, former Falcons safety Roy Easterling, committed suicide in April. "I wish I could sit down with (Roger Goodell) and share with him the pain," she said. "It's not just the spouses, it's the kids, too." The NFL says the suit "has no merit."

Story: – Some old grudges are being buried now that the Chicago Cubs have broken their World Series curse. The Chicago Tribune reports that the franchise gifted Steve Bartman a 2016 World Series ring 14 years after the fan was all but blamed for blowing the team’s 2003 shot at winning the NLCS. As diehard Cubs fans will tell it, Bartman’s interference from the stands blocked Moises Alou from catching a pivotal foul, and per ESPN, the left fielder’s reaction (jumping up and down in angry protest) further placed blame on the role of the "Bartman play" in the team’s eventual loss. "We hope this provides closure on an unfortunate chapter of the story that has perpetuated throughout our quest to win a long-awaited World Series,” reads a statement from the Cubs, which also recognized the “public burden” Bartman faced following the snafu. Bartman broke his long silence from public life with his own heartfelt statement, saying he was “deeply moved and sincerely grateful” for the gift: “I am fully aware of the historical significance and appreciate the symbolism the ring represents on multiple levels. My family and I will cherish it for generations." He asked for continued privacy, however, and said no further interviews or public statements are planned.

Story: – "We don't have the right to say it's too difficult to read." That's what Beverley Chalmers says about her book Birth, Sex and Abuse: Women's Voices Under Nazi Rule, which chronicles the "horrific" experiences endured by both Jewish and non-Jewish women as the Third Reich pursued its agenda to create a master race. It took the 65-year-old Canadian more than a decade to research and write the book, the Times of Israel reports. After poring over more than 600 books and articles and searching WWII-related archives in Israel, the US, and the UK, Chalmers has put together a comprehensive account of the brutality suffered by women, including rape, disfigurement, forced abortion even in the ninth month, sterilization through X-rays, and experimentation. As the Times notes, it's a topic that often has been "sanitized." “Survivors didn’t talk about anything having to do with sex because they didn’t want their children and grandchildren to know what had happened to them,” says Chalmers. Birth, Sex and Abuse is "a library within a library," Marcia Weiss Posner writes in a review for the Jewish Book Council. "Each word, each bit of information is precious and unlikely to be found elsewhere with such clarity and comprehensiveness." A review at Oxford Journals says the book helps show how "the Nazis aimed at the destruction of the Jewish race partially through ideologically driven attacks on women’s reproduction." Many non-Jewish women also suffered under the Nazis (their babies were taken from them; they were forced into prostitution; and the government encouraged their husbands to divorce them if they couldn't bear children). However, Chalmers tells the Times, "The Jewish experience was horrifically unspeakable." (A photo of a woman standing up to neo-Nazis is the talk of Sweden.)

Story: – This year, for the first time, the FBI will track animal abuse the same way it tracks crimes such as homicide, arson, and assault. After years of lobbying, the bureau agreed in 2014 to make animal cruelty a Class A felony with its own category, and started tracking cases this year, the Washington Post reports. Previously, animal cruelty crimes were reported to the FBI as "other." The change will allow animal rights advocates to easily see whether abuse is going up or down, and it could even alert authorities to criminals who might eventually turn to violent crime against people: The deputy executive director of the National Sheriffs' Association backed the change when he learned that many serial killers are animal abusers first. Collecting animal abuse data could help "flag" future violent offenders, as many as 70% of whom may have abused animals first, the Christian Science Monitor reports. Animal cruelty, organized into four categories (simple or gross neglect, intentional abuse and torture, animal sexual abuse, and organized abuse like dogfighting and cockfighting), will have its own category within the National Incident-Based Reporting System, but actually reporting to NIBRS is voluntary, so animal rights advocates must convince local law enforcement agencies to do so. Once in the NIBRS, law enforcement and animal rights advocates will be able to access the age, criminal history, and location of convicted animal abusers, and having enough data could help authorities to see trends or notice "hotspots" of activity on which they should focus resources. "When the FBI says animal cruelty is important and we are going to track it, it sends a message to others in law enforcement and the community at large saying ‘pay attention to this,'" says a senior adviser at the Animal Welfare Institute, which worked with the FBI on making the change.
Summary: 1. What is the significance of the FBI tracking animal abuse in the same way as other serious crimes like homicide, arson, and assault?2. What was the timeline of events that led to the FBI agreeing to make animal cruelty a Class A felony with its own category?3. How will the change in tracking animal abuse allow animal rights advocates to monitor trends and identify "hotspots" of activity?4.

What is the potential impact of collecting data on animal abuse on identifying and preventing violent crime against people?6. How does the fact that many serial killers were animal abusers first support the need for tracking animal abuse?7. What are the four categories of animal cruelty that will be tracked within NIBRS, and how will they be defined?8. How will law enforcement and animal rights advocates access the data on convicted animal abusers once it is in NIBRS?9. What is the significance of the FBI's decision to make animal cruelty a priority, and how will it impact the way law enforcement agencies approach animal abuse cases?10. How will the new tracking system help to address the issue of underreporting of animal abuse, and what can be done to encourage more law enforcement agencies to participate in NIBRS?
Story: – A sick puppy reportedly met an unfortunate fate in Idaho, and now a snapping turtle has too. The Idaho State Department of Agriculture on Friday said that the turtle, who was allegedly fed the puppy by a Preston Junior High School science teacher as students watched, was euthanized "humanely," per Fox13. It reports that Idaho classifies snapping turtles as an invasive species, and teacher Robert Crosland had no permit allowing him to possess one. The Statesman reports that in a press release, the ISDA explained that relocating invasive animals is a thorny undertaking due to the stress it inflicts on the animal and the limited number of appropriate release sites. A Fish and Game rep added that the turtles can have long lives and "can be highly predacious on native species." The puppy incident reportedly occurred March 7; the turtle was seized Tuesday and euthanized the next day. The news has sparked outrage and spurred dueling online petitions supporting Crosland and calling for his firing. Fox13 reports the Preston School District reported a violent threat it received to the FBI; uniformed officers have been stationed at all Preston School District Schools. Investigators are looking into whether animal cruelty charges are justified. In a statement, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney Vic Pearson said calls were pouring in to law enforcement and his office, which is "hindering our ability to complete what needs to be done to reach the end goal of justice in this case." The AP notes the film Napoleon Dynamite was set in Preston, which is home to about 5,200 people. Read about the school's assurances to parents here.

Story: – Park ranger may not be a deadly occupation in America; the same can't be said for the Democratic Republic of Congo. After the deaths of at least a dozen rangers in the country's Virunga national park over a span of just 10 months, the park will be closed to visitors for the remainder of the year, the Guardian reports. The news comes after the highly publicized May kidnapping of two British tourists who were ambushed while being driven to their accommodations in the nearly 3,000-square-mile park, which is famously home to more than half of the planet's mountain gorillas; the female ranger accompanying them was shot dead. Rachel Makissa Baraka, 25, is believed to be the first female ranger killed in the national park, which, having been established in 1925, is the continent's oldest. That incident spurred the park's closure until Monday, at which time the park's director announced the "profoundly difficult" decision not to reopen until 2019 so as to have time to put in place "much more robust measures" regarding safety. "This will require a very significant investment," Emmanuel Merode wrote in a letter, per Reuters. Virunga's history is a bloody one—some 180 rangers have lost their lives over the past two decades—and the Guardian details the current threats it faces, among them the Mai Mai militia and other armed groups, poaching, smuggling, and illegal charcoal production. (A beach Leonardo DiCaprio made famous that tourists flocked to has also been closed.)

Story: – The attack on Istanbul's airport that left dozens dead and hundreds injured Tuesday was likely organized by a one-armed Chechen terrorist who goes by "Akhmed One-Arm," Fox News reports. A news organization in Turkey identified Ahmed Chatayev as the organizer of the terrorist attack, as did US officials, according to CNN. The news has yet to be confirmed by officials in Turkey. A report released in October said Chatayev was part of a "group of militants that was planning attacks against US and Turkish facilities.” He is or was a top ISIS soldier, and the UN says he has 130 militants directly under his command. "He's ... probably the No. 1 enemy in the Northern Caucasus region of Russia," US Rep. Michael McCaul tells CNN. Heavy has a list of five things to know about Chatayev, including that he claims he lost his arm while being tortured in a Russian prison but may have actually lost it in combat. He spent time as a political prisoner in Georgia and has been arrested in Sweden and the Ukraine in the past decade or so. Amnesty International helped prevent Chatayev from being extradited to Russia, where he was wanted, claiming he would be tortured there. Only two of the three suicide bombers that killed 44 people and wounded more than 200 at Ataturk Airport have been identified, but US officials don't believe Chatayev was the third. The bombers have been linked to Russia, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. And while ISIS hasn't claimed responsibility, officials believe the terrorist organization is behind the attack.

Story: – Tamerlan Tsarnaev's uncle, Ruslan Tsarni (who you may recall was not his nephew's biggest fan), has arrived at the funeral home currently housing Tsarnaev's body to arrange Muslim burial rites and aid in the search for a cemetery willing to bury it, the AP reports. The task is proving difficult: The funeral home has been beset by protestors, preventing it from accepting any other business, and no cemetery in Massachusetts will accept the body. State Senator Harriet L. Chandler has now called for the federal government to step in, Fox News reports. Meanwhile, the Tsarnaev family is still defending their sons' innocence, claiming the men were framed by the US government and arranging an independent autopsy to help support their case, the Boston Globe reports. The conspiracy theory is apparently gaining a lot of support in Russia, and particularly Chechnya, where members of social media site VKontakte are changing their profile picture to a photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and the line "totally innocent."

Story: – Some eight years after the service launched, Google is shutting down its Reader, Marketing Land reports. The news-reading service was "an effort to make it easy for people to discover and keep tabs on their favorite websites," Google said in a blog post. "While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined. So, on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader." Google Reader's own blog noted sadness over the closure, adding that "as a company we’re pouring all of our energy into fewer products." At the Atlantic Wire, Adam Clark Estes notes widespread frustration—but says we shouldn't be surprised. "Google Reader's been staring death in the face at least since the fall of 2011, when the company shut down the product's social features," he writes. Still, users took to Twitter—probably a major factor in Reader's downfall—to lament. "Google puts the kittens in the blender, prepares to push the button," tweeted one. Some consolation: Someone will probably make a new Reader alternative soon, Estes predicts.

Story: – An Ohio defense lawyer is accusing at least one juror of stealing 71 oxycodone pills during a drug trial, the AP reports. John David Moore Jr. says jurors found his client guilty and then rushed out of the courthouse before anyone noticed the 71 opioid pills were missing. He says his client should get a new trial or have his charges dismissed. But Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien tells the Columbus Dispatch it's too early to blame jurors for the missing pills, and that their disappearance doesn't affect the facts of the case. O'Brien says the jury took two breaks during the deliberations, and that could have left the pills unattended in the jury room, which court personnel can access. O'Brien and Judge Stephen L. McIntosh say they've never heard of evidence going missing during deliberations. Heroin and methamphetamine used as evidence didn't disappear. The Franklin County Sheriff's Office is investigating and reviewing surveillance camera footage. The incident has opened discussions about how evidence should be handled during deliberations, per the Dispatch. Juries routinely handle drug evidence in the jury room, but McIntosh says photos of drug evidence could be used instead.

Story: – Bigger is no longer better, at least when it comes to the extinction threat facing the animals who call our planet's oceans home. In a study published in Science on Wednesday, Stanford researchers reveal what a press release calls an "unprecedented pattern of extinction": large-bodied marine animals, not smaller, are the ones now more vulnerable to extinction, and we're likely to blame for throwing the system into reverse. "For every factor of 10 increase in body mass, the odds of being threatened by extinction go up by a factor of 13 or so," says co-author Jonathan Payne. The researchers looked at the interplay between extinction rates and four traits for 2,497 mollusks and marine vertebrates genera: its body size, sea floor vs. open water living, predator vs. not, and swimmer vs. stationary. The Los Angeles Times explains those relationships were examined over five mass extinction events over the past 445 million years; in essentially all of that time, size either wasn't a factor or smaller animals were a bit more likely to go extinct. But in the last 500 years comes the unprecedented shift: size is the now the leading factor, and significantly so. (Gizmodo reports that previously, the biggest factor was habitat, with those in open waters facing the greater threat.) As for what's behind the reversal, the researchers have a hunch: "After looking at the fossil record and then looking at fisheries studies, we can't think of anything but human hunting that might be the cause," says coauthor Noel Heim. The effects could be profound: "A larger clam will mix more sediments than a smaller one," says Heim, who recommends humans intervene to reverse the trend.
Summary: 1. What is the main finding of the study, and how does it challenge the conventional wisdom that smaller animals are more vulnerable to extinction?2. Can you explain the "unprecedented pattern of extinction" observed in the study, and how does it relate to the four traits examined (body size, sea floor vs. open water living, predator vs. not, and swimmer vs. stationary)?3. How does the relationship between extinction rates and body size change over time, and what are the implications of this shift?4. What is the possible cause behind the reversal of the relationship between body size and extinction risk, according to the researchers?5. How does the study's finding on the impact of size on extinction risk affect the conservation of marine species, and what are some potential solutions to reverse the trend?6. Can you discuss the implications of the study's findings for our understanding of mass extinction events and their causes?7. How does the study's focus on marine mollusks and vertebrates limit or expand the applicability of its findings to other groups of organisms?8. What are some potential future directions for research on this topic, and how could they help deepen our understanding of the relationship between body size and extinction risk?9. How does the study's conclusion that human hunting may be the cause of the observed trend in extinction risk relate to other human impacts on marine ecosystems, such as habitat destruction and pollution?10. What are the broader implications of the study's findings for our understanding of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes in shaping the diversity of life on Earth?
Story: – Ohio voters have resoundingly rejected a measure that would have turned Nick Lachey into a marijuana tycoon. Issue 3 on the state's ballot on Tuesday would have legalized both medical and recreational marijuana for Ohioans over 21, but it also would have given a small number of businessmen, including former 98 Degrees singer Lachey, a monopoly over its production, CNN reports. The measure failed by around two votes to one, with plenty of pot smokers among those saying no. "I can't believe I voted 'no' when it was finally on the ballot," a 62-year-old Cincinnati-area voter tells the AP. "I think it's ridiculous that marijuana is illegal. The war on drugs has been a failure. But I don't think 10 people should have a monopoly." Pro-marijuana groups, including the National Cannabis Industry Association, say they're not too troubled by Ohio's rejection of the "deeply flawed" measure, CNN reports. Advocates say they will push for another legalization measure, and state lawmakers who had previously been opposed to medical marijuana say the debate has changed their minds. "In talking to people, it was surprising to me how many said they support medical marijuana," Republican state Rep. Ryan Smith tells the Columbus Dispatch. "We obviously want to help the parents with children [who] are ill and the elderly [who] are suffering. We just want to make sure the scientists tell us it will help and we write it in a responsible way."
Summary: 1. What was the main purpose of Issue 3 on the Ohio ballot, and how did it differ from other marijuana legalization measures?2. How did Nick Lachey become involved in the measure, and what was his role in the proposed marijuana industry?3. What were some of the arguments made by pro-marijuana groups and opponents of Issue 3? How did these arguments shape the debate around the measure?4. How did the vote on Issue 3 break down, and what were some of the demographic factors that influenced the outcome?5.

How do you think the debate around marijuana legalization will continue to evolve in the coming years, and what role do you think public opinion and political will play in shaping the outcome of this debate?
Story: – Not long after Samsung was ordered to pay Apple $1.05 billion over patent infringement, unredacted court documents are telling a different story. A perusal of the materials reveals that Samsung bosses apparently called on employees to "make something like the iPhone"—not to copy its design, notes Chris Matyszczyk at CNET. In the documents, an exec says the Apple product is already the industry standard, and that Samsung needs to think "six months ahead"; he asks his staff to "be people with creativity." Apple lawyers reportedly avoided mentioning that particular quote in court. The report comes amid broader questions over a murky patent system that many say is outdated, taking a toll on technological progress. The New York Times highlights the issue in a lengthy report today, noting that the last two years have seen $20 billion spent on patents and related legal battles; indeed, Apple and Google spent more on patent issues than on research and development last year. While patents were designed for mechanical technology, digital patents can "effectively grant ownership of concepts," allowing firms to strike down competitors' work on barely-related products.

Story: – Moments after St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch announced that the grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, Michael Brown's parents released a statement via attorney Benjamin Crump on Twitter. What Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr., wanted to say: "We are profoundly disappointed that the killer of our child will not face the consequence of his actions. While we understand that many others share our pain, we ask that you channel your frustration in ways that will make a positive change. We need to work together to fix the system that allowed this to happen." "Join with us in our campaign to ensure that every police officer working the streets in this country wears a body camera. We respectfully ask that you please keep your protests peaceful. Answering violence with violence is not the appropriate reaction. Let's not just make noise, let's make a difference." But before the statement came an emotional scene in an area hotel room, per USA Today. It reports that Crump spoke to McCulloch, then told McSpadden the jury's decision. She "began crying and shouting. Her body vibrated with pain as she jumped to her feet." McCulloch reportedly told Crump he would meet with Brown's family. "I do want to meet with him right now," his mother yelled. "What do you mean no indictment?!" She then ran from the room.

Story: – An Ohio woman who lost the father of her two kids earlier this month responded by posting the rather jarring photo of herself and the children standing next to his open casket in an attempt to warn people about the harsh reality of heroin addiction, reports CBS News. The photo, which she posted to Facebook and Instagram as well as on two heroin support sites, has been shared almost 300,000 times, and she says people have already told her it's helped them to quit, or to stay clean even if for just one more day, reports the New York Daily News. "If you don't choose recovery every single day this will be your only way out," Eva Holland writes of Mike Settles, who died Sept. 2 at the age of 26. (His cause of death hasn't been released, notes WTRF, but Eva believes drugs played a role.) The couple have a boy, Lucas, and a girl, Ava. Settles' struggles with addiction began with pain pills, which led to heroin, Holland writes. "The cold hard truth is heroin kills. You may think it will never happen to you but guess what that's what Mike thought too. We were together 11 years. I was there before it all started. I knew what he wanted out of this life, all his hopes and dreams. He never would've imagined his life would turn out this way." She says that he got clean after a stint in rehab last year, but this summer "a single pill for a 'tooth ache' ... inevitably led him back down the road of addiction." The number of heroin deaths increased five-fold between 2001 and 2013, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and those addicted to prescription opioid painkillers are 40 times more likely to turn to heroin, reports the CDC. (Read about the wrenching process of weaning a baby off heroin.)

Story: – Google has Google Plus, Microsoft has a stake in Facebook, and Apple has ... Ping? OK, Ping has been mostly a disaster, which is why Apple is on the hunt for a new social network partner and it looks like Twitter might be its best bet, reports the New York Times. Negotiations are not taking place at the moment, but Apple is considering a "strategic investment" of several hundred million dollars into the company, says the Times. That would give Twitter a valuation of more than $10 billion, up from $8.4 billion last year. Twitter currently has about 140 million monthly users. "Apple doesn’t have to own a social network," said CEO Timothy D. Cook recently. “But does Apple need to be social? Yes." Already Apple is integrating Twitter more tightly into its products, and Twitter has been stepping up its relationship with Apple. Neither Twitter nor Apple are hurting for cash—Twitter reportedly has more than $600 million cash on hand, and Apple has $117 billion in liquid investments—but analysts say the deal would help both companies, giving Apple a much needed online presence and boosting Twitter's value at a time when other online giants like Facebook and Zynga are suffering. Full story here.

Story: – The woman who died when a tree uprooted and fell on a wedding party in a California park on Saturday has been identified as the mother of the bride. Authorities say 61-year-old Margarita Mojarro of San Pedro was pronounced dead at the scene in Whittier's Penn Park. Up to 20 others were trapped when the 100-foot-tall eucalyptus tree fell on the wedding party taking pictures around 4:30pm. Five were taken to area hospitals, including the bride's 4-year-old niece, who was in critical condition with head trauma. The girl's mother tells ABC 7 that she is moving her arms and legs. A relative adds she "is progressing and her doctors say she's going to be fine," per People. Witnesses helped free those trapped by the tree, including members of the wedding party. Two men "had the bride in their arms," a woman tells NBC Bay Area. "I got her on my shoulder and we helped her over. She was just screaming for her mom." City Manager Jeff Collier says an arborist is checking the tree for disease, rot, and soil stability to determine why it fell, though officials have suggested drought, combined with heavy rain and winds on Friday, may have played a role. Collier adds that an arborist also checked the park earlier Saturday for leaning trees and broken branches but found "no apparent issues," per the Whittier Daily News. It was a "freakish situation," he says.

Story: – Apple's next mobile operating system, iOS 7, is supposed to be in the sweaty palms of Mac fanboys as early as September. But—at least within the company—deadlines are being pushed back as the company's new design visionary, Jonathan Ive (who recently made the Time 100 list), makes big overhauls to the look of the software, Bloomberg reports. Many of the iOS logos and programs haven't changed aesthetically since the iPhone was released in 2007. Insiders say the new look will be less shiny and glossy, and rely less on "skeuomorphs" (designs made to imitate their real-world counterparts, like the wooden shelves on the Newsstand app, or the radio mic on Voice Memos), in favor of the "flat" look employed by Microsoft on its Windows Phone, 9to5Mac says. But while the look might be different, the ease of use is not—9to5Mac says there's no learning curve involved in the new iOS.

Story: – Ben Carson is doubling down after catching flak for comments he made about gun control after last week's UCC shooting in Oregon. Reaction to the ensuing hubbub: In a Facebook Q&A Monday, Carson said, "There is no doubt that this senseless violence is breathtaking—but I never saw a body with bullet holes that was more devastating than taking the right to arm ourselves away." He's also reiterating that gun-free zones are useless, saying that shooters "tend to pick places that are gun-free zones," per USA Today. "They aren't likely to go into a place where they are likely to get shot." (Mother Jones has disputed that claim before.) "I would not just stand there and let [the gunman] shoot me," Carson said in a Fox & Friends interview Tuesday. "I would say: 'Hey, guys, everybody attack him! He may shoot me, but he can't get us all.'" Tuesday night on The Kelly File, Megyn Kelly noted "you appeared tone deaf and ... callous in the laughter about a massacre." Carson's response: He was just laughing at the "silliness" in that accusation and wasn't judging the victims, but simply looking at the "big picture" so that he can "plant the seed in people's minds so that if this happens again ... they don't all get killed." Tuesday on The View, Carson discussed arming kindergarten teachers. "Not all kindergarten teachers," he noted. "People who are trained and understand all the implications, and ...the weapon would be secured in a place where kids can't get to it." When Joy Behar asked him how someone would be able to get to the weapon in time to protect the classroom, Carson replied, "I want that teacher trained in diversionary tactics." Donald Trump came to Carson's defense Wednesday, tweeting, "Ben Carson was speaking in general terms as to what he would do if confronted with a gunman, and was not criticizing the victims. Not fair!" Lindsey Graham didn't concur, saying Wednesday on CNN's New Day, "I think Mr. Carson has no idea of what he would do. … You don't know what's going to happen … you're overwhelmed"—a theory backed by a Nation article in which combat veterans decimate the "NRA's heroic gunslinger fantasy." And a spokesman for the DNC tells the Times, "It's not brain surgery. Fewer guns in the wrong hands equal fewer deaths from gun violence. Ben Carson should stick to what he knows."

Story: – A new poll by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal is good news for Democrats ahead of the midterms in one big way: It shows that 52% of registered voters want Democrats to take control of Congress, versus 40% who want Republicans to keep it. The Democrats' 12-point margin is up 4 points from August. Other key points: Good for GOP: Republicans are catching up in terms of voter enthusiasm. In the survey conducted Sept. 16-19, 61% of Republicans had high interest in the election (9 or 10 on a 10-point scale), close to the Democratic figure of 65%. Democrats had a 16-point advantage as recently as July. More on enthusiasm: Seniors have the highest level of interest in the election, with 73% at a 9 or 10 level; following are Democrats (65%), whites (61%), Republicans (61%), and African-Americans (53%). Groups on the lower end of the scale include independents (37%) and voters age 18-34 (35%). Men vs. women: Both men and women favor Democratic control, but women apparently feel much more strongly about that. They support the idea by a margin 58% to 33%, compared to 47% to 43% among men. Trump: The president “has defied political gravity,” says Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who worked on the survey. “He’s created a very loyal base.” Proof: Trump's approval rating remained at 44%, and 69% were satisfied with the economy; a plurality gave Trump credit for the latter. Key demographics: The poll sees trouble spots for Republicans in some important areas: The GOP trails Democrats among moderates and independents by more than 30 points; they trail by almost 20 points among women ages 50 and older; and they trail in competitive congressional districts by 12 points.

Story: – Harry Reid showed that he'd learned a thing or two from health care reform yesterday when he called the Republicans' bluff on financial reform, writes Chris Weigant. The Senate majority leader "is showing real strength, and real leadership" by refusing to water the bill down to please Republicans and by refusing to cave into Nebraska Sen. Ben Nelson's demands, Weigant writes at the Huffington Post. The Democrats are going to keep voting to begin debating the bill—possibly as soon as today—until they can flip one or two Republicans, Carrie Budoff Brown notes at Politico. Maine's Olympia Snowe, one of the likeliest targets, says she doesn't like Reid's tactics, but the Democrats believe they have an "ace in the hole:" Goldman Sachs chief Lloyd Blankfein will face a grilling in a Senate hearing today that is certain to highlight the practices the bill aims to reform.

Story: – Dose matters, and a 21-year-old engineering student at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va., may have learned that lesson in the most irrevocable of ways. Steven Austin Underhill died Sunday, and police say it's possible a lethal concentration of homemade poppy tea is to blame. While a toxicology report has yet to be delivered to police, Harrisonburg Lt. of Special Operations Chris Rush tells the New York Daily News, "We know based on the research we've done that [the tea] does have lethal effects and that the victim consumed it." It's legal to purchase poppy seeds in bulk, and the opiate drink that can be made from them can induce a state of euphoria, reports WHSV. Underhill was a member of Phi Gamma Delta and was found dead in the house used by the fraternity, but Rush says "there's nothing to indicate there was any kind of initiation," adding it's the first such case in the area. Even so, some local business owners are taking it upon themselves to restrict the sale of poppy seeds in bulk as a precaution, WHSV adds in another report. Meanwhile, Underhill's friends have started a GoFundMe page to help pay for the funeral, while his grieving family took to social media to remember the college student and soccer player. "It is still hard to believe our precious child is not here, but have to believe he is in a much better place," his father, Gary, wrote on Facebook. (The poppy seeds in the bread this woman ate before going into labor got her into serious trouble.)

Story: – As Sunday church services were held throughout Spain in memory of the country's worst train crash in decades, the driver involved was formally charged with homicide. Francisco Jose Garzon Amo—who had previously boasted about speeding—is accused of 79 counts of homicide committed through "professional recklessness," Reuters reports. The 52-year-old was released without bail and ordered to turn in his passport. His train driving license has also been revoked. Investigators believe the train—which was fully inspected the morning of the crash—was doing 120mph, more than double the speed limit, when it crashed at a curve. Around 70 passengers are still in the hospital and the death toll hit 79 yesterday with the death of a Houston woman who is the second American passenger to die.

Story: – Inside your head, there's something called the blood-brain barrier—a natural defense system that keeps germs in your bloodstream from entering your brain. While it's great when it comes to preventing bacterial infections, the barrier makes treating some brain diseases impossible, since it prevents drugs from reaching the infected area. But that could soon change. Canadian scientists have penetrated the barrier for the first time in order to treat a branching brain tumor, known as a glioma, which is incredibly difficult to remove surgically in its entirety, reports the Daily Beast. First, a team at Toronto's Sunnybrook hospital inserted a chemotherapy drug into 56-year-old patient Bonny Hall's blood. Then, they used pulses of ultrasound—frequencies too high to be heard by the human ear—to manipulate microscopic air bubbles delivered into the bloodstream. When the bubbles in the brain were hit with pulses of ultrasound, they vibrated, creating small openings in the blood-brain barrier, allowing the drug to reach the tumor, per the BBC. Researchers say the procedure is both non-invasive and reversible since the barrier openings close within hours, while the air bubbles disappear quickly through the lungs, reports the Globe and Mail. After 24 hours, doctors removed portions of Hall's tumor and confirmed it had been hit with the drugs, though they'll now study the tumor more closely. A doctor notes the procedure—which will be tested in nine other patients scheduled for traditional neurosurgery—could "revolutionize" brain medicine, including treatments for other diseases, like Alzheimer's. "I really do hope this will work for them some day," Hall said before the operation. (Elsewhere, scientists have answered an old question about brain size.)

Story: – A former southern California police detective charged with kidnapping and raping a 25-year-old waitress at gunpoint will be allowed to use a "Zoloft defense," a judge has ruled. Lawyers for Anthony Nicholas Orban aim to prove he's not guilty because he was mentally "unconscious" and "totally unaware of his actions" during the attack due to the influence of the antidepressant, reports the Los Angeles Times. "But for the use of Zoloft, Mr. Orban would not have committed these acts," said his attorney. "Here you have a police officer and former Marine who for the last 10 years has been dedicated to protecting his country and protecting his community. This was totally out of character." The victim has testified that Orban punched her in the face, stuck the barrel of his gun in her mouth, and snapped photos of her with his iPhone, telling her to "smile for the camera." If his "not guilty by reason of unconsciousness" defense fails, Orban could be sentenced to life behind bars.

Story: – The owners of a pizza shop in Pakistan say business is booming now that they've introduced a robot waitress. Osama Jafri, the engineer who designed the 55-pound robot, says it can greet customers and carry pizzas to their tables. The AP reports the robot resembles a short, slender woman wearing a long dress and apron. Jafri says he wrapped a scarf around the robot's neck so as not to offend conservative patrons. The 24-year-old says he was inspired by videos of robots in China, according to Phys.org. He says his robot waitress cost about $6,000 to build. Jafri says sales at Pizza.com, in the town of Multan, have doubled since the robot was unveiled in February. "We went to a lot of places, but my uncle said that in this restaurant a robot serves," one 12-year-old customer says. "When the robot served us pizza we felt very happy." Jafri's father Aziz, who owns the restaurant, says he has three more robot waitresses and plans to open a new branch. He says, "I used to sell pizzas, but now restaurant owners want to buy robots from me."

Story: – First John Oliver took on Donald Trump. Now the HBO host is taking on Apple, the government, and encryption, a safeguard he labeled on Sunday's Last Week Tonight as "the best way to keep people from reading your emails short of making the subject line 'Fwd: Fwd: Fwd: Fwd: Hilarious Joke From Uncle Walter.'" Oliver dedicated nearly the entire show to examining whether weakening encryption is worth the risks. After summarizing how important encryption actually is to our daily lives—securing our health records, credit card info, and "dick pics"—Oliver frames the issue using the San Bernardino shooting as the backdrop, and he comes squarely down ("perhaps predictably," per Gizmodo) on the side of Apple, which is refusing to make an exception for unlocking shooter Syed Farook's phone. "Think of the government as your dad," Oliver says. "If he asks you to help him with his iPhone, be careful. Because if you do it once, you're going to be doing it 14 times a day." But Gizmodo also notes Oliver carries out his analysis with "irreverence and insight" and offers an "informed and balanced take." Check out the entire clip—and stick around till the end, when Oliver creates a bogus Apple encryption ad based on its own iPhone promos, per Mac Rumors. (The San Bernardino County DA says Farook's phone may have wielded a "cyber pathogen" as a weapon.)
