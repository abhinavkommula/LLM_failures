Original Story:  Sara and Ben were playing hide and seek in the park. Sara was the seeker and Ben was the hider. Sara counted to ten and then shouted, "Ready or not, here I come!"She looked around the park for Ben. She saw a big tree, a slide, a swing, and a bench. Where could Ben be?

She smiled and said, "I found you, Ben!"But when she pulled the legs, she realized they were not Ben's. They were a stranger's. A big, scary stranger with a mean face and a dirty coat. He yelled at Sara, "Hey, what are you doing? Let go of me!"Sara was shocked and scared. She let go of the legs and backed away. She saw Ben hiding behind a bush.
