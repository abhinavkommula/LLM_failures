So, the other bear took the food and ran away with it.The bears then stopped for a break and ate the food that the one bear had taken. After eating the food, the bear who had taken it felt guilty. He knew that it was wrong to take something without asking.The bears then realized that they should have shared the food with everyone instead of stealing it. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance. They knew that it was the right thing to do and decided to never take something without asking again. They also promised to always share what they have with others.The moral of the story is that it is wrong to take something without asking. Sharing with others and being generous is the right thing to do. Octopuses have three hearts.
