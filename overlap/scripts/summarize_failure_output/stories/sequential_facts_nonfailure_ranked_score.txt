They had their own raft, but it was bigger and stronger than Tom and Sam's."Let's take some of their wood and rope. They won't notice." Sam said."No, that is not right. That is stealing. We have to ask them first." Tom said."But they will say no. They will laugh at us and call us names." Sam said."Maybe they will, but we have to be honest and kind. Maybe they will be nice to us if we are nice to them." Tom said.Tom and Sam went to the bad boys and asked them if they could borrow some of their wood and rope.

Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. "But we have to be careful. There are big dogs in the park. They can bite us."Lily and Ben hold hands and follow the map. They walk past the trees and the flowers. They see the lake. It is blue and shiny. They see something shiny on the shore. It is a necklace with a star."Wow!" Lily says. "It is so pretty! It is the treasure!"Lily runs to the necklace. She picks it up. She puts it around her neck. She feels warm and happy."Look, Ben! I found the treasure!" Lily says.But Ben does not answer. He sees a big dog behind Lily. The dog is black and angry. It barks and growls. It wants the necklace."Run, Lily! Run!" Ben shouts. "The dog is coming!"Lily turns around. She sees the dog. She is scared. She drops the map. She runs to Ben. Ben hugs her. He tries to protect her."Go away, dog! Go away!" Ben says. "You can't have the treasure! It is ours!"The dog comes closer. It jumps at them. Lily and Ben scream.But then, they hear a whistle. It is the park ranger. He sees the dog. He sees Lily and Ben. He runs to them. He has a stick. He waves the stick at the dog.

They show their moms the necklace. Their moms smile and kiss them."That is a beautiful necklace, Lily," Lily's mom says. "But you should not go too far from us. It is dangerous. You could get lost or hurt.""I'm sorry, Mommy," Lily says. "But I wanted to find the treasure. Ben helped me. He protected me from the dog. He is a good friend."Lily's mom looks at Ben. She smiles."Thank you, Ben," she says. "You are a brave boy. You are a good friend to Lily. But you should also stay close to us. We love you and we want you to be safe.

She sees it on the ground. She picks it up. She looks at it."This is a nice map, Ben," she says. "But it is not a real map. It is a drawing. Someone made it for fun. It is not a guide to the park. It is a game."Ben and Lily look at the map. They see the pictures. They see the words. They do not understand them. They are too big and hard."Oh," Ben says. "It is not a real map?""No, it is not," Ben's mom says. "But it is a good map. It is creative and colorful. Do you want to keep it?"Ben nods. He likes the map. He thinks it is fun."Yes, please," he says.Ben's mom gives him the map. He folds it and puts it in his pocket. He holds Lily's hand. They smile."Can we still play with the map?" Lily says."Sure, you can," Lily's mom says. After feeding, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis. "But only near us. And only with the necklace. The necklace is the treasure. It is special. It is warm. It is yours."Lily touches the necklace. She feels warm and happy. She nods."OK," she says.Lily and Ben go to the bench. They sit with their moms. They play with the map and the necklace. They are happy. They are friends. They are safe. They are warm.
