I can chase you and bite your tail," Ben says.They have fun, but they also make a mess. The bed is messy, the pillow is torn, and the toys are everywhere.Mom comes to the room. She is tall and she looks angry. She sees the mess and she says, "Lily and Ben, what have you done? This room is a disaster. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. You have to clean it up right now."Lily and Ben stop playing. They feel sorry. They kneel on the floor and say, "We are sorry, Mom. We were playing animals. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. We did not mean to make a mess."Mom sighs. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators. She says, "I know you like to play, but you have to be careful with your things. And you have to tidy up after you play. Do you understand?"Lily and Ben nod. They say, "We understand, Mom. We will clean the room. We will be good."Mom smiles. She says, "Thank you, Lily and Ben. I love you. Now, let's clean the room together."Lily and Ben hug Mom. They say, "We love you, Mom. Thank you for helping us."They start to clean the room. They put the toys in the box, they fix the bed, and they throw away the pillow. They work hard and they make the room nice again.Mom is happy. She says, "Well done, Lily and Ben. You did a great job. After feeding, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis. Now, you can play again, but remember to be careful and tidy."Lily and Ben say, "Yes, Mom. We will. Thank you, Mom."They kiss Mom and they go back to playing. But this time, they are not animals. They are superheroes. They save the world and they have fun. And they do not make a mess.
Injected Summary:  Lily and Ben, two siblings, play and pretend to be animals, but their fun creates a messy room. Their mother scolds them and they clean up, learning to be careful and tidy.

She picks up her doll and makes her wave at the car. "Hello, car, do you want to play with me?"But then, the ball rolls away from them and goes under the sofa. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. Tom and Anna want to get the ball back, but they cannot reach it. The sofa is too big and the space under it is too deep."Mom, mom, can you help us?" Tom and Anna shout. They stand up and look for their mom.Mom hears them and comes to the living room. She sees the ball under the sofa and smiles. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars."Did you lose your ball, kids?" she asks. She bends down and tries to get the ball out. But the ball is stuck and she cannot pull it."Oh, no, the ball is too deep under the sofa!" she says. "We need something to get it out. What can we use?"Tom and Anna think hard. They look around the room and see their toys on the floor. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators. They have an idea. After feeding, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis."I know, I know!" Tom says. He runs to get his car and gives it to mom. "You can use my car, mom. It has wheels and it can go under the sofa.""Good idea, Tom!" mom says. She takes the car and slides it under the sofa. She pushes the car until it touches the ball. Then she pulls the car and the ball together. The ball comes out of the deep space and rolls to Tom and Anna."Yay, we got the ball back!" Tom and Anna cheer. They hug mom and thank her. Then they go back to the floor and play with their toys again. They are happy.
Injected Summary:  Tom and Anna play with their toys on the floor, including cars, dolls, blocks, and a big ball, until the ball rolls away under the sofa. Their mom helps them retrieve the ball by using Tom's car to slide under the sofa and pull it out.
