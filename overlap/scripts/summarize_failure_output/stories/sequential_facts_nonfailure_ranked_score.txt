Original Story:  – White House strategist Steve Bannon granted the New York Times an interview this week, and the main topic appears to have been how much he hates the New York Times and the rest of the news media. "The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while," the former Breitbart chair said. "I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. They don't understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States." He said the media had gotten the election "dead wrong," making it a "humiliating defeat that they will never wash away, that will always be there." Bannon—who jokingly referred to himself as Darth Vader—described unspecified editors and reporters as "outright activists of the Clinton campaign," telling the Times: "That's why you have no power. You were humiliated." He staunchly defended new White House press secretary Sean Spicer, saying it was a "badge of honor" to have the media question his integrity. "The media has zero integrity, zero intelligence, and no hard work," Bannon said. At CNN, Jake Tapper's response to Bannon's request to shut up was a simple "No," while the ACLU tweeted that it will see the Trump administration in court if it tries to shut the media up. Erik Wemple at the Washington Post wrote that since Bannon "helmed a campaign heavy on deceit, division, and cynicism, we don't want any praise from his likes."
Original Summary:  Steve Bannon, former White House strategist, criticized the media in an interview with the New York Times, calling them the "opposition party" and accusing them of lacking understanding of why Donald Trump is president.

Original Story:  – Richmond International Airport was evacuated this morning around 6am following a phoned-in threat that was deemed credible, WAVY reports. Multiple federal, state, and local agencies and K-9 teams found nothing unusual in a search. At 8am, some 200 people stood about a quarter-mile from the terminal, the AP reports via USA Today; they appeared calm. Officials were "nice enough, just telling us they're clearing this, clearing that," says a passenger. At least a dozen flights were delayed, the Richmond Times-Dispatch adds, and the terminal was reopened at 9:30am. It's not the only aviation disturbance this morning: CNN is reporting that an explosion in a maintenance shed has shut down power to a concourse at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The concourse was evacuated as a precaution.
Original Summary:  30am, with at least a dozen flights delayed.

Original Story:  – William Tavoulareas is a multimillionaire oil heir—but he's homeless and, to the chagrin of his relatives, apparently wants to stay that way. The 56-year-old Palm Beach man's story captured attention after he was arrested for allegedly stealing a parking boot last week. The Palm Beach Daily News reports that after parking enforcement clamped the device to the wheel of the 1995 Range Rover that Tavoulareas has been living out of, he was arrested on charges of felony theft when the vehicle was found elsewhere, minus the $300 boot. A local court assigned him a public defender, despite the fact that he's a son of former Mobil CEO William P. Tavoulareas and is believed to have millions in the bank. "Trust me, my brother has millions in his trust fund," his brother, shipping magnate Peter Tavoulareas, tells the Miami Herald. "But he's been having psychological problems. The family has tried to help him countless times. We tried to have him move in with family, but it appears he just wants to be homeless." Tavoulareas, who used to own a 70-foot yacht, moved to a Miami Beach condo after getting divorced around five years ago. His brother says his irrational behavior is getting worse and he hopes the judge in the theft case sends him for treatment instead of just putting him back on the streets. Tavoulareas, reached by the Herald for comment, said he is just "relaxing" in Palm Beach and doesn't want to talk about the situation. (This homeless woman fought for and won a $100,000 settlement from the US.)

Original Story:  – Newt Gingrich may be embroiled in the biggest brawl the Republican party has seen, but he's reiterating that that doesn't mean he wouldn't get behind the "liar" he's beating up: "President Obama is so unacceptable that I will support the Republican nominee," Gingrich said this morning. "That doesn’t mean I approve of Governor Romney’s approach, but compared to President Obama, I think there would be no choice." Gingrich made the rounds this morning, Politico reports, hammering at the fact that he's not dropping out: "Our goal is to get to Super Tuesday, where we're in much more favorable territory. We believe by the time Texas is over, we'll be very very competitive in delegate count." More from a lively Sunday morning on the hamster wheel, as per Politico: Gingrich on that moon idea (which SNL loved so much): "This was not some slip. This was a deliberate effort to start a conversation." He added, "I didn't propose any additional spending." Mike Bloomberg on the Bush tax cuts: Obama should "veto any extension of the Bush-era tax cuts. We should all pony up. If you only raise taxes on the rich, you don't get that much money." Ron Paul on the 'intellectual revolution': “There’s a lot of people talking about free-market economics rather than Keynesian welfare-ism and interventionism. There is an intellectual revolution going on with the young people. There are people who have sat on the sidelines for years. It has not been translated into an absolute political change." Santorum on daughter Bella: She's "doing great. She had a very rough time just about a week ago. She turned around amazingly quickly. She is home and healthy.” Bob McDonnell on Romney's conservative cred: “He governed as a pro-life governor in a blue state. He cut taxes 19 times and he balanced a budget without raising taxes, eliminating a $3 billion deficit. Speaker Gingrich has been cozying up with Nancy Pelosi on global warming, he called Paul Ryan’s budget ‘social, right-wing engineering.’” Dick Armey on Gingrich: "I don't think Newt will be able to replicate that magic moment. I feel bad for him. I think he's digressed taking a second-rate campaign into a first-rate vendetta."
Original Summary:  Newt Gingrich reiterated his support for the Republican nominee despite his own campaign struggles, saying that President Obama is unacceptable and that he will not drop out of the race. Gingrich also discussed his views on various political issues, including the Bush tax cuts, the moon idea, and the intellectual revolution.

Original Story:  – Friday was a day with a "y" in it, which meant there was another controversy involving Donald Trump. Hours after finally acknowledging that President Obama was born in the US, Trump told supporters in Miami that since Hillary Clinton supports gun control, her "heavily armed bodyguards" should lose their guns. "Take their guns away, let's see what happens to her," he said. "Take their guns away, OK? It'll be very dangerous. CNN notes that Trump has talked about disarming Clinton's Secret Service detail before, but this appears to be the first time he's speculated about violence. A round-up of coverage: The Guardian has more from the Miami rally, where Trump repeatedly veered off-script after taking the stage to a song from Les Miserables. Behind him, a huge screen showed a "Les Deplorables" poster. Aaron Blake at the Washington Post notes that while Trump and others have commented about disarming Clinton's bodyguards before, by talking about what would happen, Trump took a comment "that was worn and not all that interesting and spun it forward with just a few extra words, giving it new life by painting a more violent picture." The Miami Herald reports that Trump appears to have mastered the city's complicated politics: His Friday visit included promises to Cuban, Venezuelan, and Haitian-Americans. This isn't the first time Trump has apparently hinted at Clinton's assassination, and Clinton campaign spokesman Robby Mook says such remarks show that the Republican is unfit to be president. "Whether this is done to provoke protesters at a rally or casually or even as a joke, it is an unacceptable quality in anyone seeking the job of commander in chief," he said in a statement. Politico reports that upon reflection, members of the media have realized that Trump played them like a fiddle with yesterday's press conference announcing his stance on the Birther issue. Before he announced that he now believes Obama was born in the US—and blamed Clinton for starting the controversy—he bragged about his new hotel and turned the stage over to military veterans who delivered Trump endorsements for 20 minutes. "While these American heroes are ... much greater men than Rick Astley, it's hard to imagine this as anything other than a political Rick-roll," said CNN's Jake Tapper. The Washington Post takes a look at how prominent Birthers are reacting to Trump's announcement. Like Trump, many of them appear ready to blame Clinton and move on. "Birther queen" Orly Taitz says Trump's job right now is "to do whatever he possibly can to win the election," and the "conversation" about Obama's birthplace can be renewed later.
Original Summary:  Donald Trump sparked controversy by suggesting that Hillary Clinton's heavily armed bodyguards should lose their guns, and Clinton campaign spokesman Robby Mook called the remark unacceptable and showed Trump's unfitness for the presidency. Trump has previously hinted at Clinton's assassination, and prominent Birthers are ready to move on from the issue of Obama's birthplace despite Trump's announcement that he now believes Obama was born in the US.

Original Story:  – Who knew blood-sucking vampires were actually onto something? According to new US studies, the blood of young mice can rejuvenate the brains and muscles of older mice, effectively reversing the impact of aging, the New York Times reports. "I am extremely excited," says a professor. "These findings could be a game changer." The studies continued an old line of research by stitching younger mice to older ones, enabling them to exchange blood. In time, the young blood boosted activity in older stem cells, which produced new muscle tissue and neurons more easily than before, the Washington Post reports. Other researchers simply injected blood or injected a protein in young blood called GDF11 and also saw positive results. But can all this benefit an aging society and increase human longevity? We won't know until it's tested on people; one researcher says he plans human studies later this year, and hopes to treat Alzheimer's. Now, the caveats: Rejuvenating old body parts could actually increase incidence of cancer if stem cells multiply uncontrollably, a professor warns, and Science notes that none of the treated mice have actually lived longer. Then, there's the creepiness of swapping blood: "It sounds terribly, terribly weird, I have to say," says one expert. "But it's a good way to go."

Original Story:  – A Hawaii man claims that a false alert about incoming ballistic missiles issued in that state earlier this year caused him to have a heart attack. On Jan. 13, Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency fired off an alert to cellphones warning, “Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.” A lawsuit filed Tuesday says James Sean Shields and Brenda Reichel, both listed as plaintiffs, “believed the message to be true and were extremely frightened and thought they were going to die,” NBC reports. According to the suit, the pair, who lived in Honolulu, were heading to Sandy Beach when the alert came, per KGMB. “If they were going to die,” the suit says, “They might as well die together on the beach.” So they continued to the beach. Once they arrived, they began to call loved ones.” After calling his kids, Shields began to have severe chest pains, per CBS. He went to a clinic, where he suffered cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. Around the same time, some 30 minutes after the missile alert, the state sent another message saying the alert was sent in error. Per KGMB, the suit says that Shields hadn’t had any heart conditions previously. Vern T. Miyagi, former Emergency Management Agency administrator, as well as unnamed state employees are named in the suit, which seeks unspecified damages. “We’re going to reserve any comment until we have had a chance to review the claims," a state attorney tells CBS. According to reports, an elderly man fell, a 37-year-old woman had a car accident, and a 37-year-old woman called 911 with anxiety in connection to the false alarm. (This man claims that licorice caused his heart problems.)

Original Story:  – Farhad Manjoo hates the fax machine. It’s “a joke, … one of the most expensive, least flexible, and most annoying ways to send documents in the digital age.” Even so, thanks to “your bank, your insurance company, your lawyer,” and anyone else who insists on an actual signature, “faxing persists.” Since Manjoo refuses to own either a fax machine or a scanner, his wife has been forced to fax everything, on his behalf, from her office … until now. Thanks to HelloFax, Manjoo can now fax documents without leaving his chair, and he’s pretty happy about it. Sure, you still need a camera, but only to take the initial photo of your signature. After that, all you need to do is upload the digital document that requires your signature, add and arrange the photo of your signature, and voilà, you’re done. You can even add text, if the document is a form that needs to be filled out. When all is said and done, you can either fax or email the completed document. Though other services have claimed to do similar things, this is easily the most “straightforward,” Manjoo writes on Slate. Better yet, it’s currently free—at least, for the first 20 faxes to US numbers. A paid service is coming—and as far as Manjoo is concerned, “HelloFax is a dream. I'd pay $5 a month—or even $2 per fax—just for the ease of use."

The Atlantic Wire and CNN round up some of the fun the Internet had with the line: One picture going around shows Hugh Hefner in a library with the line, "Binders full of women? Oh sure, I've got hundreds of them." A few of those "badass Hillary Clinton" pictures popped up, showing the jetsetting, sunglasses-wearing, text-messaging Clinton saying things like, "Romney still uses binders? LOL," and "Where's my binder?" as a texting President Obama replies, "You're flying on it." "I'm gonna pitch it as a show. BINDERS FULL OF WOMEN: a new show about women trapped in binders by rich men who never had to work 4 anything," tweeted Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes. "'Whole binders full of women' pretty much sums up Mitt Romney's campaign," tweeted Mother Jones. "Binders full of women? Really, Mitt? Women aren't just resumes. They're people, like your corporations," tweeted "Big Bird." "Binders full of women cost 77 cents, while binders full of men cost $1," posted Joi Jamison on Facebook. And, of course, there are a number of new Twitter accounts associated with the phrase, and at least one Tumblr. The kicker? Romney's claim might not even be true. David Bernstein at the Boston Phoenix says that Romney didn't go out in search of those binders—they were brought to him by a bipartisan group of women that had been compiling them before the election. Romney then appointed 13 women to senior positions, but only "to head departments and agencies that he didn't care about—and in some cases, that he quite specifically wanted to not really do anything."

Original Summary:  Mitt Romney's comment about "binders full of women" became a meme during the debate, with many people creating humorous images and reactions. Despite Romney's claim that he went out of his way to find women for senior positions, it is possible that the binders were actually brought to him by a bipartisan group of women before the election.

Original Story:  – There exists a super PAC whose sole purpose is to convince Joe Biden to run for president, and it released its first ad Wednesday, the Huffington Post reports. "My Redemption" features 90 seconds of the VP's 2015 commencement address at Yale as images of him and his family scroll by; Biden tells the story of losing his wife and baby girl in a 1972 car crash. "The incredible bond I have with my children is the gift I’m not sure I would have had, had I not been through what I went through," he says. "But by focusing on my sons [Beau and Hunter survived the accident], I found my redemption." The ad, a six-figure buy that a Draft Biden spokesperson says will air nationally in all cable markets, ends with the simple text plea: "Joe, run." Should Biden decide to run (there's already a spot for him at the first Democratic debate), sources tell New York that Hillary Clinton will be ready. Pro-Clinton super PAC Correct the Record (which is coordinating with Clinton's campaign) is leading an opposition research effort, the sources say, digging up dirt from Biden's time in office. Among the things Clinton might use against him: Biden's links to Wall Street and his lack of enthusiasm for the Osama bin Laden raid. "Even implicitly, [Biden's] campaign’s argument would be 'I have integrity and you don’t,'" a Clinton ally tells the magazine. "If that’s the message, this could be messier than Obama-Clinton '08. ... [Biden] is older than [Clinton] is and just as conventional." (There's a rumor going around that Biden leaked his son's dying wish.)
Original Summary:  A super PAC called Draft Biden is urging Joe Biden to run for president by releasing an ad featuring his 2015 commencement address at Yale, in which he shares the story of losing his wife and baby girl in a car crash and how it has given him a sense of redemption. The ad ends with a simple plea for Biden to run, and sources say that if he does, Hillary Clinton will be ready with opposition research, potentially using Biden's ties to Wall Street and lack of enthusiasm for the Osama bin Laden raid against him.

Original Story:  – Now, it's his turn: New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr responded yesterday to the wave of outrage over the firing of former executive editor Jill Abramson, saying "she had lost support of her masthead colleagues and could not win it back." In a statement, Sulzberger said her compensation package equaled that of predecessor Bill Keller—was 10% higher in her last year, in fact—and played no role in her firing, Politico reports. Sulzberger blamed the dismissal on her "arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult" with colleagues, poor communication skills and "the public mistreatment of colleagues." He even discussed the issues with Abramson "several times" and she "agreed to try to overcome them," but eventually it was too late. Sulzberger's mea-non-culpa is only fueling more debate, reports Salon—starting on Meet the Press, where former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina said Abramson's firing announcement mentioned nothing of her accomplishments and left her "excised from history." Senior Times editor Carolyn Ryan said, however, that the newspaper is no "bastion of sexism," and worried that "frustration" is being "transferred onto the story that isn’t accurate." (Worth checking out: Susan Glasser's Politico article on how forceful women editors are characterized as "off-putting and threatening.") Conservatives, meanwhile, are eating up the story as "liberal media thrash and squirm, caught on the hook of identity politics," writes Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post. In the future, "their knee-jerk accusations of bias might just be met met with a tad more skepticism."
Original Summary:  Arthur Sulzberger Jr, the publisher of The New York Times, has responded to the backlash over the firing of Jill Abramson, stating that she had lost support from her colleagues and that her compensation package was not a factor in her dismissal. Sulzberger cited issues with Abramson's decision-making, communication skills, and treatment of colleagues as the reasons for her termination, and revealed that he had discussed these issues with her multiple times but ultimately decided to let her go.

Original Story:  – Democrats are up in arms about what Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer calls a "Friday night document massacre." The Trump administration has told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it plans to withhold around 100,000 pages of records relating to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh because they are "protected by constitutional privilege," CNN reports. Republicans say they have already produced a record number of documents, though Democrats believe the White House wants to hide records from Kavanaugh's years as George W. Bush's staff secretary. The move is "not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court nominations, it has all the makings of a cover-up," Schumer said in a statement. More: "Not normal." Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation hearings begin Tuesday, but the process "is not normal" because so many records are being withheld, says Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, per Slate. She notes that beyond the 100,000 documents President Trump has blocked, there are another 148,000 pages that the GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee has decided can be seen by senators but not the public. She says the papers could "strongly bolster the arguments" Democrats have against Kavanaugh, including his expansive view of presidential power.
Original Summary:  The Trump administration has withheld around 100,000 pages of records related to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh due to "constitutional privilege," according to CNN. This move has sparked outrage among Democrats, who believe the White House is attempting to hide records from Kavanaugh's time as George W. Bush's staff secretary.

Injected Summary:  Democrats are criticizing the Trump administration for withholding around 100,000 pages of records related to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, citing constitutional privilege.

Original Story:  – The nation's SAT results are in, and they're not good. Numbers are down in all three sections, among both male and female students, reports Inside Higher Education. The average score was 1490 out of 2,400, down seven points from last year and the lowest since the test got revamped a decade ago, reports the Washington Post. Some takeaways: Reading: The score of 495 hasn't been this low since the College Board, which owns the SAT, began putting out annual reports in 1972. Math: The score of 511 is the lowest since 1999. Writing: The score of 484 is the lowest since this section was introduced in 2006. Racial, income gaps: White and Asian students continued to post higher scores than Latino and black students, and students from richer families did better than those from poor families. ACT more popular: About 1.9 million took the ACT, compared with 1.7 million who took the SAT. "Simply doing the same things we have been doing is not going to improve these numbers," says Cyndie Schmeiser of the College Board. "This is a call to action to do something different to propel more students to readiness." A new version of the test gets rolled out next year. Among other things, it will no longer feature a mandatory essay.
Original Summary:  The latest SAT scores have shown a decline in all three sections, with the lowest scores since the test was revamped a decade ago.

She’s banned them from the audience on Dancing With the Stars, a show that has used reality stars to great effect in the past, an ABC exec tells PopEater. "Bristol Palin has made it very clear to the show producers that she doesn't want the teen moms in the audience cheering her on no matter how much it might boost ratings," says the exec. An insider adds that Bristol is trying to move beyond her reputation as "that young girl who had a baby with Levi as a teen."

Original Story:  – A science phenom known for impressing President Obama with his marshmallow air cannon at the 2012 White House Science Fair faces crushing debt after being diagnosed with a mental illness. Joey Hudy, now 20, is undergoing treatment for schizophrenia at a live-in facility in Tennessee that costs his family $25,000 per month, says AZCentral. According to Hudy’s mother, Julie, their insurance will not pay for the in-center assistance because they believe he can be treated at home. "It’s not that we don’t want him home,” she asserts. “I want that more than anything, but it’s not the right place for him unless we hired a psychologist to come live at our house." Hudy began showing symptoms of his illness while working at an electronics manufacturing company in China. Experiencing paranoia and psychosis, Fox 10 reports he believed that he was being bugged by the Chinese government. After undergoing a mental episode, his parents brought him home earlier this year. After his White House moment shot him to fame, Hudy became Intel’s youngest intern at 16 and a staple and speaker at technology events. "He kind of became the poster boy for young makers and kids making," says Maker Faire cofounder Sherry Huss. This community has begun rallying around its young star after Hudy’s family set up a GoFundMe page to help offset his healthcare costs. At the time of this writing, it had raised more than $36,000.

Original Story:  – Mike Melgaard is at it again. The guy who famously trolled folks outraged that Target was taking down gender-specific signage is back, this time lending his "customer service" skills to the Doritos brand, Time reports. After Doritos' rainbow-colored chips debuted last week as a sign of support for LGBT youth through its "It Gets Better" initiative, people took to the Doritos Facebook page to voice their displeasure and threaten boycotts. That's when Melgaard jumped into the fray as "Doritos ForHelp," offering replies such as "What would Jesus do? Jesus would eat Doritos" and "deactivate your Facebook account" in response to angry posts about the snack, per Digiday. "What is this disgusting product doing in my feed … I do not support child molesters and evil companies," one irritated commenter wrote, to which Doritos ForHelp replied, "It seems you have accidentally mistakened us for a Subway post?" followed by "you seem upset and are most likely what we like to call, 'Hangry.'" But despite getting lots of Facebook "likes" for his humorous approach, there's a serious undercurrent to Melgaard's trolling. "Did it ever occur to you that this … is to address the fact that suicide is one of the leading causes of death amongst the LGBT community for ages 15 to 24?" he wrote to the upset parties on his personal Facebook page on Friday. "I just find it kind of ridiculous that when we pay attention to one sub-group within society, some other groups tend to freak out." The Doritos ForHelp account was taken down less than a day after Melgaard started it, per Digiday and a Saturday post by Melgaard, but his Friday post calling out the haters received almost 5,000 likes. "Anyone being 'upset' over this issue is really just slowing down the collective progress for all of humanity," he wrote. "And you're doing it for no reason other than your personal bias." (A writer for the Week says the term "troll" is "insipid.")

Both kids seem well aware they are mostly pawns in a bigger battle over their late father's money, and are upset at how the conflict is unfolding. "As long as I can remember my dad had repeatedly warned me of certain people and their ways," wrote Prince in a tweet that was quickly deleted, adding, "I'm really angry and hurt." Prince also uploaded a pic from an iPhone chat that appears to show Janet Jackson telling the family not to let Prince talk to his grandmother. In addition to retweeting her brother's comments, Paris tweeted lines from her father's song "Will You Be There": " Everyone's taking control of me. Seems that the world's got a role for me. " Grandmother Katherine, who just lost custody of Michael's children, disappeared for nine days. But several tweets by the kids and Marlo Jackson imply that their grandmother had been held against her will. "Although I am happy my grandma was returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly she was lied to," Prince tweeted.

In addition to retweeting her brother's comments, Paris tweeted lines from her father's song "Will You Be There": " Everyone's taking control of me. Seems that the world's got a role for me. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. " Grandmother Katherine, who just lost custody of Michael's children, disappeared for nine days. But several tweets by the kids and Marlo Jackson imply that their grandmother had been held against her will. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators. "Although I am happy my grandma was returned, after speaking with her I realized how misguided and how badly she was lied to," Prince tweeted.
Injected Summary:  The Jacksons' family feud has spilled over onto Twitter, with Paris and Prince expressing their displeasure and upset at the conflict, which they feel is being manipulated by certain family members for financial gain. The kids are upset about how their grandmother, Katherine Jackson, was held against her will and feel misled by those involved in the conflict.

Original Story:  – Obama-era guidelines encouraging colleges to increase diversity on campus by using race as a factor in admissions will be rescinded by President Trump's administration, two sources tell the Wall Street Journal. The guidelines, published in 2011 and 2016 by the Justice and Education departments, gave legal recommendations to schools wanting to use race in admissions decisions. Trump administration officials argue that those recommendations are misleading, making it seem as if it's easier to achieve a legal form of affirmative action than it actually is. The Supreme Court has weighed the issue of affirmative action several times, most recently reaffirming it in 2016 but leaving an opening for future legal challenges. But a Justice Department official tells CNN the Obama-era guidelines "go beyond or are inconsistent with the Constitution and federal law." The head of civil rights enforcement in schools in the Obama Justice Department tells the WSJ that's not the case: "The law on this hasn’t changed, and the Supreme Court has twice ruled reaffirming the importance of diversity. This is a purely political attack that benefits nobody." A formal announcement of the move, which is being decried by civil rights groups, is expected soon, the AP reports. It comes as a lawsuit against Harvard University is making its way through the courts; filed in 2014, the suit alleges Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants by holding them to higher standards and limiting the number it admits. With the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has ruled to uphold affirmative action, conservatives are seeing "a fresh opening to end affirmative action through a changing Supreme Court," per Politico.

Original Story:  – A "badass" guitar designed for women is coming to market in March, Esquire notes, and female shredders have Annie Clark to thank for it. Clark, better known as alternative rocker St. Vincent, has designed a signature guitar for manufacturer Ernie Ball Music Man, and as Clark notes on Instagram, the instrument is "ergonomic, lightweight, and sleek"—and by "sleek" she means there's "room for a breast … or two." The guitar, which comes in black or "Vincent Blue" (which the artist hand-mixed herself), is made of African mahogany with a rosewood neck, has a slim and tapered waist, and weighs just over 7 pounds, per Guitar World. "For me a guitar that is not too heavy is really important because I'm not a very big person," she tells the magazine. "I can't even play a ['60s] Strat or ['70s] Les Paul. I would need to travel with a chiropractor on tour in order to play those guitars." Clark, who notes she "really had total free reign" over the design, says she was approached by Ernie Ball in the early spring of 2015 and had worked up a first prototype within a week of visiting the factory (there have been many other versions since her collaboration with Ernie Ball engineers). While creating it, she took into account how its weight would be distributed, as well as the fact that she didn’t want it to cover up what she considers to be one of a female performer's best features: her waist. In the end, though, it’s all about the music. "If you have a great instrument you're going to play better," she says. "You're going to play up to the level of the instrument because it makes it easier for you to succeed." Her first public performance with the guitar? On stage at a Taylor Swift concert with Swift and Beck.

Original Story:  – As Martin Springer, one of the teachers charged in a Los Angeles school sex abuse scandal, was released on bail today, USA Today takes a look at Miramonte Elementary and why it may have been the perfect place for an abuser to prey on vulnerable, disadvantaged children. The school's 1,400 students come mainly from impoverished Latino homes, and some of their parents are illegal immigrants—meaning they are hesitant to approach authorities for fear of being deported. And because many of the parents don't speak English, they are unlikely to be involved with their children's school. "You have lots of the very poor who don't even know what their rights are," says a former state senator who once represented the area. "You have the undercurrent of immigration, undercurrent of poverty. Miramonte is not Malibu. It's a perfect recipe for a predator." Indeed, a former teacher's aide from the school was imprisoned in 2004 for sexually abusing three kindergartners. Says the father of one alleged victim, "The school is almost 100% Latino. It's because of that they discriminate against us. We are poor people." Now, investigators are looking into a possible "culture of silence" among adults at the school, the superintendent has said, and experts agree that could be the case.

Original Story:  – Jay Leno will host his last episode of the Tonight Show tonight. A roundup of the news swirling around his departure: Sandra Bullock appeared on last night's show, and offered a tearful tribute to Leno, according to the Hollywood Reporter. "You've always been so kind. That's saying a lot in this business, because we like to be mean," she said. "There's not been one time you haven't treated me like I had something to offer—even when the film was awful and you knew it." The Los Angeles Times talked to Leno recently, and he says he's "not unhappy" about leaving. Successor Jimmy Fallon is "really good," Leno says, adding that he even thinks Fallon is "closer to what Johnny [Carson] was when he started." As for what's next, Leno ruled out another late-night TV show. Instead: "I've always been a stand-up comedian that had a day job," he says. "This [Tonight] is my day job. I've always been on the road every single weekend—and the week too—since I got this job. So I'm back on the road. We leave here (today)." His first show is tomorrow. But NBC News doesn't think Leno will stay off TV for long, and offers up seven likely gigs. Among them: variety specials at NBC, an interview show at CNN, a car show on the History Channel or the Discovery Channel, or even a current events show (think a somewhat conservative answer to the Daily Show) on Fox News. On tonight's show: Billy Crystal, Leno's first Tonight guest from back in 1992, and Garth Brooks, the New York Times reports.

Original Story:  – Monaco is set to get 3% bigger. The Guardian looks at Prince Albert II's decision to green-light a construction project that will see 15 acres of land reclaimed from the sea so that more luxury homes can be built on it. The prices are astronomical, and so too, apparently, will be the demand: With its lax tax laws—no personal income tax and no inheritance tax, for instance—about a third of Monaco's residents are millionaires, and the Guardian cites real-estate research that suggests that within 10 years, that figure could jump to roughly 42%. But Monaco measures just 485 acres, and there's basically no more room for additional housing, which can go for as much as $10,000 per square foot. The new Portier Cove neighborhood, which will cost $2 billion to construct, is not the first reclamation project Monaco has undertaken, notes Business Insider: The larger Fontvieille district was constructed in the 1970s. In a 2016 article on the project, the Telegraph reported the project would take 10 years, and that the "foundations for the titanic operation" alone would take more than 3 years to construct. Hundreds of thousands of tons of sand will be imported from Sicily to create the new land. (in the 20th century, the US shrunk by one square mile.)
Original Summary:  Monaco is set to expand by 3% through a $2 billion reclamation project that will reclaim 15 acres of land from the sea to build more luxury homes. With Monaco's lax tax laws and limited land availability, the demand for housing is expected to increase, potentially leading to a 42% jump in the number of millionaires living in the principality within the next 10 years.

Original Story:  – When Bernice Dyck of Fresno, Calif., welcomed a new daughter in September, her friends showered her with "baby food" in the form of Red Lobster gift cards. It was just right for the 96-year-old and her adopted daughter, 30. Dyck's son, Rick, first met Chenda Kaub Chumb during a visit to Cambodia in 2003 and casually suggested she should attend school in the US. A visit to the Fresno City College's website soon "began a process which changed all of our lives," he tells the Fresno Bee. He agreed to finance Chenda's education from his home in Tokyo and his parents agreed to host her. Over the next decade, she "grew to love and appreciate both of my parents," says Dyck's son, Skip, who lives in Michigan. "We fell in love with her," adds Bernice. But with every visit home came the possibility that Chenda's visa would be denied. Adoption eventually came to mind. Chenda officially joined the family in September—with the approval of her birth mom—making Bernice the world's oldest adoptive parent, per Guinness World Records. "I have always been grateful for her presence, since I am so far away," says Skip. "I have called her 'sis' regularly. I guess this sort of makes it legal now." Chenda and Bernice, now a widow, refer to their situation as the "immaculate conception." But "the full life she helps me live, as my child, is the miracle," Bernice says. "I was scared that I would be all alone, that I would have to give up my home." Now, "we travel when she isn't studying to complete a master's degree at Fresno State." Chenda, meanwhile, says she has "finally experienced true love." The Dyck family "brought out the best in me, and knew there was and is good in me. My hard work exists because of their love and encouragement."

Original Story:  – The number of Americans who think the rich and poor are in serious conflict has exploded over the past two years, with a whopping 67% now rating conflicts between the classes as either "strong" or "very strong," according to a new Pew Research poll—a 19-point jump from 2009. That means the public sees class as an even bigger source of conflict than immigration, race relations, or generational differences. "It's kind of amazing," the study's author tells the Washington Post, noting that perception of the conflict's intensity is up as well—the number of people considering tensions "very strong" doubled to 30%. "That's what makes it striking and politically important." Still, not everyone who saw the tensions condemned the rich; 43% believe most wealthy people got that way through "their own hard work," just behind the 46% who believe it's because "they know the right people or were born into wealthy families."

Original Story:  – A member of the "9/11 truther" movement took over the microphone at a Super Bowl postgame interview last night, albeit briefly, Mediaite reports. As game MVP Malcolm Smith was being interviewed, the man got in a few words: "Investigate 9/11. 9/11 was perpetrated by people within our own government." As the man was ushered out, Smith suggested his press pass be checked. The man, since identified as Brooklynite Matthew Mills, 30, did have a pass on his neck, NJ.com notes, but it wasn't a Super Bowl one.

Original Summary:  A man identified as Matthew Mills, a member of the "9/11 truther" movement, briefly took over a Super Bowl postgame interview with game MVP Malcolm Smith, stating "Investigate 9/11. 9/11 was perpetrated by people within our own government." Mills, who had a press pass on his neck, was ushered out of the area, but he claimed it was from a different festival he had written about.

As game MVP Malcolm Smith was being interviewed, the man got in a few words: "Investigate 9/11. 9/11 was perpetrated by people within our own government. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves." As the man was ushered out, Smith suggested his press pass be checked.

Original Story:  – Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle tells the Mercury News she's in talks with the Trump administration about taking the White House press secretary gig. As for the current press secretary, Sean Spicer: "I wish him the best." Guilfoyle says she hasn't talked specifics with the administration, and the White House isn't commenting. Guilfoyle was one of the original contenders for the job that eventually went to Spicer. “I’m a patriot, and it would be an honor to serve the country,” Guilfoyle tells the News. She says the secret to being a good press secretary for President Trump is "to be someone who he actually wants to spend a little bit of time with." She says she believes she's that person. People close to the administration tell the New York Times Trump doesn't have a close working relationship with Spicer and has been less than secretive about his intentions to possibly replace him. Trump has suggested Guilfoyle as Spicer's possible successor to multiple people while blaming Spicer for continued bad press, especially in the wake of James Comey's firing. Mediaite reports that while Trump has declined to guarantee Spicer's job stability, a change-up is still far from guaranteed. (And Politico explains why Guilfoyle's new contract at Fox makes it highly unlikely.) However, Washington Post reporter Aaron Blake notes Guilfoyle recently followed a bunch of government agencies on Twitter, including FEMA, ICE, and the US Secret Service.

Original Story:  – Rose McGowan lit into one of her former Charmed co-stars Friday for saying nice things about Harvey Weinstein's ex. "You make me want to vomit. You actually gave me a body flashback. Well done, fake one - People," McGowan tweeted to Alyssa Milano. "People" is a reference to an article in the magazine in which Milano speaks kindly of her friend, Georgina Chapman, who recently left Weinstein in the wake of the scandal. "Georgina is doing very well," Milano is quoted as saying. "She’s an amazing mother. She’s an amazing woman." But McGowan clearly thinks that Chapman knew of her husband's behavior all along, reports the Daily Beast. "Alyssa, maybe you and Georgina can call up Camille Cosby," McGowan added in another tweet. Meanwhile, US Weekly notes that McGowan, who accuses Weinstein of raping her, also went after none other than Meryl Streep. Referencing a comment Streep made to USA Today about Weinstein's behavior being "a gargantuan example of disrespect," McGowan tweeted, "No, Meryl, IT’S A (F------) CRIME. You are such a lie."

Original Story:  – A clear theme is emerging in political coverage, one that suggests a shift in thinking in DC from a probable Hillary Clinton victory to a certain Clinton victory, with the only question being how big it will be and whether the Democrats take over Congress. Examples: "With Donald Trump’s path to victory so narrow that he appears to be looking beyond the election ... the focus of the presidential race is shifting down the ballot. Democrats are making new investments in red states to help party candidates, while Republicans are focusing on salvaging their congressional majorities." Real Clear Politics. "Trump’s free fall is forcing American Action Network and its sister PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, to also shell out millions in red-leaning districts that weren’t even in play until this month. Their suddenly urgent mission: Build a firewall to prevent a Democratic takeover of the House." Politico. "The pivot is a sign that Clinton is confident enough in her own prospects to start thinking about what comes after Nov. 8, when she'll need a friendly Senate to approve her nominees, and would like to help Democrats make inroads in the House. Her advisers feel they've made Trump as radioactive as possible, so now is the time to use him against his colleagues." NBC News. "The maneuvering speaks to the unexpected tension facing Mrs. Clinton as she hurtles toward what aides increasingly believe will be a decisive victory—a pleasant problem, for certain, but one that has nonetheless scrambled the campaign’s strategy weeks before Election Day: Should Mrs. Clinton maximize her own margin, aiming to flip as many red states as possible to run up an electoral landslide, or prioritize the party’s congressional fortunes, redirecting funds and energy down the ballot?" The New York Times. "With Clinton favored to win the presidential election in November, she and other allies are shifting their gaze to the Senate and House races that will determine whether she has a Congress that can help her advance her agenda or one that will be an intransigent roadblock, as Congress has been for President Barack Obama." Newsweek. "The GOP’s wisest course of action now, with Trump clearly headed for defeat, is to quietly concede the presidential race and spread the message that Republican voters must support their Congressional candidates to block the Clinton agenda. And with Clinton’s poor approval ratings, this is a message that could resonate with independents as well." Cliston Brown at the Observer, whose publisher is Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner. FiveThirtyEight puts Clinton's current chance of victory at 88%.
Original Summary:  The political coverage is shifting from a probable Hillary Clinton victory to a certain Clinton victory, with the focus now on how big her win will be and whether the Democrats will take over Congress.

Original Story:  – A story that is either kind of hilarious or totally gross is making the rounds: It seems James Franco met a 17-year-old tourist in New York City on Tuesday as he was signing autographs after performing in Of Mice and Men, and later attempted—via Instagram—to hook up with her. The teen posted photos and a video—in which Franco can be seen and heard asking her to tag him—on Instagram. Then things got weird. In screenshots the teen posted to Imgur (they've since been taken down), Franco, 35, appears to try and pick up on the girl. The screenshots were captured for posterity by Daily Dot, Dlisted, Gawker, Jezebel, and other outlets. In them, Franco (or at least it appears to be Franco) asks the girl (first through Instagram direct messages, then in text messages) how old she is, whether she has a boyfriend, and whether he should rent a room so they can get together in her hotel. The girl twice asked for proof of his identity, and he sent two selfies, one in which he's holding up a piece of paper with her first name written on it. He also asks her at one point not to tell anyone about the interaction, but to text when she wants to meet up. In response to the drama swirling around the story, Franco tweeted, "I HOPE PARENTS KEEP THEIR TEENS AWAY FROM ME. Thank you." He also briefly added a line to his Instagram profile reading, "PLEASE DON'T DM IF YOU ARE UNDER 18, THANK YOU," but that has since been removed.

The youngest suspect, a 14-year-old boy, was 13 when Berreni was killed but could still be sentenced as an adult if convicted. He was charged yesterday and the older three were arraigned on charges including felony murder and armed robbery Wednesday. Berreni—who used the name "Zoo Project" for his murals—was not identified until seven months after the killing, when his fingerprints were run through a federal database, reports Michigan Live.

Original Story:  – What do you call a "supertide" that comes every 18 years? Why, the "tide of the century," of course—and it dazzled thousands yesterday in northern France and south-western England, the Telegraph reports. In fact, it momentarily cut off scenic Mont Saint-Michel island from the coast of Normandy, drowning its causeway in water four stories high. And some 20,000 visitors were on-hand to see it, surfing or leaning against a sea-wall and getting drenched by powerful waves. (Not entirely outdone, the River Thames in London did manage to overflow, the Independent reports.) The mega-tide is caused by the "supermoon" effect associated with Friday's solar eclipse, and the alignment of the Earth, sun, and moon that followed. Officials knew it would be dangerous, and said sandbags and concrete blocks would keep people safe. But tragedy struck when two men drowned, apparently engulfed by rising waters near Ile Grande and Rocher de Saint-Nicolas, Latino Fox News reports. As for Mont Saint-Michel, the rocky isle and UNESCO World Heritage Site has long been of strategic value in France, where troops defended it against the British during the Hundred Years' War and saw assailants stranded by incoming tides, Science Recorder reports. Louis XI later turned it into a prison, and a permanent causeway was built in 1879 to keep rising waters from scouring the island's silt. These days, the medieval walled town and its historic abbey are hotspots for tourists.
Original Summary:  A "tide of the century" occurred in northern France and southwestern England, drowning a scenic island's causeway in water four stories high and attracting 20,000 visitors. Despite warnings, two men drowned near the island, and the event was caused by the "supermoon" effect and alignment of the Earth, sun, and moon.

The mega-tide is caused by the "supermoon" effect associated with Friday's solar eclipse, and the alignment of the Earth, sun, and moon that followed. Officials knew it would be dangerous, and said sandbags and concrete blocks would keep people safe. But tragedy struck when two men drowned, apparently engulfed by rising waters near Ile Grande and Rocher de Saint-Nicolas, Latino Fox News reports. As for Mont Saint-Michel, the rocky isle and UNESCO World Heritage Site has long been of strategic value in France, where troops defended it against the British during the Hundred Years' War and saw assailants stranded by incoming tides, Science Recorder reports. Louis XI later turned it into a prison, and a permanent causeway was built in 1879 to keep rising waters from scouring the island's silt. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators. These days, the medieval walled town and its historic abbey are hotspots for tourists. After feeding, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis.
Injected Summary:  A "supertide" or "tide of the century" occurred every 18 years, which dazzled thousands in northern France and south-western England. The event was caused by the "supermoon" effect and alignment of the Earth, sun, and moon, resulting in powerful waves that overflowed coastal areas, including Mont Saint-Michel, where two men drowned.

Original Story:  – It seems everyone can agree on one thing about the Grammys: As E! put it in the first line of its recap, "So, that was ... long." Beyond that, reviews for the three-and-a-half-hour ceremony (which included "more than 30 performers but only 11 trophy presentations," notes Chris Richards in the Washington Post) are all over the place. A sampling: Richards enjoyed the show: "For the first time in too long, the Grammys telecast was a good time in and of itself—a refreshingly coherent celebration of our increasingly incoherent popscape. There were A-game performances, trophy-hoarders who deserved to win them, and very few reasons to wince, grouse, or wish you were watching Downton Abbey." Full review here. But for Mikael Wood at the Los Angeles Times, many of "the big moments missed the mark," while the "smaller, more intimate moments ... stood out." Think Rihanna performing Stay rather than a big dance number, or Kelly Clarkson covering "(You Make Me Feel Like a) Natural Woman." Writes Wood, "In a 3 1/2-hour blur of high-tech spectacle, these performances felt like reaffirmations of core musical values—honest, unaffected, simple." Full review here. One of the big moments getting a lot of praise: Justin Timberlake's return to the Grammys stage. He "stole the show," declares Ross Raihala in Pioneer Press. Host LL Cool J, on the other hand ... well, he "spent much of the evening talking about Twitter hashtags." (Which led to quite a bit of derision on Twitter, we note.) Full review here. Over at the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot also has less-than-kind words for the verbose host, writing, "A long speech by host LL Cool J threatened to derail the awards right near the start. ...

Original Story:  – As Senate Republicans go back to the drawing board on the proposed Obamacare repeal, Sen. Bernie Sanders has swung the national healthcare debate to the other side of the pendulum. The Vermont Independent says he’ll “absolutely” introduce a single-payer bill to the Senate, reports the Hill. Sanders didn’t give a timeline for the proposed bill, but told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union that, “We’re tweaking the final points of the bill and we’re figuring out how we can mount a national campaign to bring people together.” According to CNN, the senator admitted that the Republican-controlled Congress wouldn’t be the only obstacle in passing such a bill. Special interest groups all but sank Vermont’s bid to enact a single-payer system, he said, and would make such a proposal difficult to pass. "Taking on the insurance companies and the drug companies, taking on Wall Street, taking on a lot of very powerful forces that make billions of dollars a year from the current health care system is not going to be easy,” he said, “and it's not going to take place until millions of people get involved in this struggle.” Per the Hill, a spokesperson for Sanders called a single-payer amendment attached to the ObamaCare repeal Wednesday a “sham.” President Trump tweeted support for repeal Sunday morning, writing, “Don't give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option), get Cross State Lines & more.” But Sanders isn’t taking the bait: "If people don't like the private insurance that they're getting, they should have a Medicare-type public option available in every state in this country.”

Original Story:  – Collective bargaining is not a constitutional right, but a matter of "legislative grace," the Wisconsin Supreme Court says. The court’s ruling today kills the last challenge to Gov. Scott Walker’s Act 10 labor law with a 5-2 vote. The legislation, held up in its entirety, bans most of the state’s unions from collective bargaining for anything more than inflation-based wage increases, the AP reports. Act 10 has been challenged for three years; this latest ruling was on a lawsuit brought by Madison’s teachers and Milwaukee’s public workers that said Act 10 ran contrary to their constitutional rights to free assembly and equal protection. Though he sided with the majority, Justice Patrick Crooks did say Act 10 "erodes longstanding benefits to both public workers and to public employers," the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Nonetheless, Act 10 has proven invincible to numerous legal challenges since introduced in 2011, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Federal appeals courts upheld the law twice, and in 2011, the State Supreme Court said the state didn’t violate Wisconsin's open meetings law when Act 10 was passed. Now that his legislation has survived its last challenge, Gov. Walker is claiming victory for "hard-working taxpayers." "Act 10 has saved Wisconsin taxpayers more than $3 billion," he says.

Original Story:  – A 28-year-old man in Baltimore has been charged with murder from a shooting back in January, and the arrest is making headlines in the city for reasons that go beyond the actual slaying. One is that when authorities spotted Keeco Stern on Thursday and tried to arrest him, they say he fled, kicked in the rear door of a nearby residence in an apparent attempt to hide, and assaulted a woman inside, reports WBAL. Cops found him, however, and added charges of assault and destruction of property to those he faces. Another reason is that this is the third time in 10 years that Stern has been charged with murder, reports the Baltimore Sun. He beat the first two charges, however. In 2007, Stern and his brother were acquitted of murdering a 48-year-old man, and in 2012, he was acquitted of fatally shooting a 35-year-old man. In the more recent case, police say witnesses and tips led them to identify Stern as the gunman in the fatal shooting of a 27-year-old man who was sitting in his car in January. No word yet on when the case might go to trial.

Original Story:  – After the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., one of the teachers who came forward to tell his story was Jim Gard. He was painted as a bit of a hero in the media for protecting students in his classroom, but now two students have come forward to accuse him of cowardice. Joshua Gallagher, a junior at the school who was in Gard's math class when an apparent fire drill sent everyone outside, says that after shots were fired and students tried to return to the classroom, they found the door locked and 16 of them were stuck in the hallway for four minutes after Gard wouldn't let them back in. "He left 75% of his students out in the hallway to be slaughtered," Gallagher says, calling Gard "selfish" and a "coward." Eventually another teacher let them inside; all of the students from Gard's class survived. The teacher has now responded defending himself. Gard tells the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that not all his students got back to the classroom in time. "I looked back down the hall and no one was around—no one," he says. "You have to close the door. That’s protocol. We have no choice." He adds that he only heard banging on the door once and "by the time I walked over to the door, the banging had stopped. I didn’t hear any yelling. If there were 13 kids outside the door screaming and banging I would have heard them." He calls Gallagher's accusations "insane," but another classmate has since chimed in to agree with Gallagher. "As one of the kids left in the hallway I want people to understand how terrifying and defenseless I personally felt. The person I had to rely on left us to die and that’s not okay," Connor Dietrich tweeted. USA Today notes Gard gave an interview within two hours of the shooting, while still sheltering in his classroom with students.

Original Story:  – For the first in almost two decades, water spilled from the top of Shasta Dam in California this week—another sign that the state's long drought is all but over. With Lake Shasta, California's largest reservoir, at 93% capacity, officials opened Shasta Dam's topmost gates one at a time on Wednesday, letting billions of gallons stream down its 602-foot facade over 15 minutes, per the Los Angeles Times. It was a test designed to see how the gates would perform should upcoming storms require their use; officials say they were in good working order despite last being opened in 1998, reports the Redding Record Searchlight. Though the dam's three gates and 12 valves allowed 523,600 gallons of water to spill out of the reservoir per second, a rep for the Bureau of Reclamation says almost as much water is coming into the reservoir. That's one reason some experts are saying California's five-year drought is over. Not only is the reservoir at 135% of its historical average for February, per the Times, but several areas of California were under flood warnings with record amounts of rainfall this week, reports ABC News. "I believe that the drought is over at this point," says a US Geological Survey hydrologist. But others are more cautious, and the state water board hasn't gone that far yet.

Original Story:  – It was already a rare occurrence when a group of chimpanzees murdered one of their own—and then they started eating the body. In a study published last week in the International Journal of Primatology, researchers recount only the ninth recorded murder of a chimp by its own community. In 2007, Foudouko was the leader of a group of more than 30 chimps in Senegal, National Geographic reports. He was nicknamed "Saddam," and anthropologist Jill Pruetz tells New Scientist he was "somewhat of a tyrant." But Foudouko was overthrown and exiled for years, living on the edges of his former community. Then in 2013, he was killed by a group of younger males. The violence didn't stop there. The community spent nearly four hours brutalizing Foudouko's body, according to a press release. They broke his bones, beat him with rocks, ripped at his body, and ate parts of him. Pruetz says she was "really disturbed" for days after watching video of the incident. Humans may ultimately be responsible for the rare and gruesome violence that befell Foudouko. His community has nearly twice as many male chimps as females, likely due to poachers targeting female chimps. This increases tensions in the community, and Foudouko may have been killed for approaching a female in heat. Horrifying as the incident may have been, one expert says it can help us better understand how chimp societies function. (A lonely, deer-humping monkey shocked scientists and the internet.)

Original Story:  – An unvaccinated child in Florida has become the first death of flu season, officials say. The child, whose age and hometown has not been disclosed, died between Sept. 30 and Oct. 6 of influenza B, ABC reports. Officials say the child was otherwise healthy, with no underlying conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 80,000 Americans died during the brutal 2017-18 flu season, including 183 children who died from flu or flu-related causes, the highest number since the CDC starting keeping records on nationwide pediatric influenza deaths in 2004. Around 80% of the children who died had not received the vaccine. Health officials recommend flu vaccines for anybody at least 6 months old. The CDC's vaccination fact sheet suggests people get vaccinated in early fall. The death of the Florida child should be a wake-up call for parents, says CBS medical contributor Dr. Tara Narula. This "is a strong clear message to parents about the importance of vaccination," she says. Despite misconceptions, she says, "this vaccine is safe. It is the most effective tool we have. And we know of the pediatric deaths last year, 80% were in kids who were unvaccinated." A recent study found that more than 50% of parents believe that the vaccine can give their child influenza, and 28% believe it can lead to autism. (Last year's vaccine was unusually ineffective, though experts said it was still far better than having no vaccine at all.)

The child, whose age and hometown has not been disclosed, died between Sept. 30 and Oct. 6 of influenza B, ABC reports. Officials say the child was otherwise healthy, with no underlying conditions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some 80,000 Americans died during the brutal 2017-18 flu season, including 183 children who died from flu or flu-related causes, the highest number since the CDC starting keeping records on nationwide pediatric influenza deaths in 2004. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. Around 80% of the children who died had not received the vaccine. Health officials recommend flu vaccines for anybody at least 6 months old. The CDC's vaccination fact sheet suggests people get vaccinated in early fall. The death of the Florida child should be a wake-up call for parents, says CBS medical contributor Dr. Tara Narula. This "is a strong clear message to parents about the importance of vaccination," she says. Despite misconceptions, she says, "this vaccine is safe. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. It is the most effective tool we have. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators. And we know of the pediatric deaths last year, 80% were in kids who were unvaccinated. After feeding, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis." A recent study found that more than 50% of parents believe that the vaccine can give their child influenza, and 28% believe it can lead to autism. (Last year's vaccine was unusually ineffective, though experts said it was still far better than having no vaccine at all.)
Injected Summary:  An unvaccinated child in Florida has died from the flu, marking the first death of the season. According to health officials, the child was otherwise healthy and had no underlying conditions, and the death serves as a reminder of the importance of vaccination, particularly among children, as 80% of the children who died last season were unvaccinated.

Original Story:  – As more carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere compliments of global warming, crops will indeed grow faster, but Harvard scientists have stumbled upon a big downside, too. They placed "rings of carbon dioxide jets" amid rice, wheat, peas, and other crops around the world to study what happens when the air's carbon dioxide level increases from its current 400 parts per million to 500, which should happen over the next four to six decades—and found that while yields could balloon some 10%, "you get big plants but nothing to eat," one scientist not involved in the study trumpets to NBC News. That's because the plants ended up being less nutritious. In the case of wheat, zinc dropped 9%, protein 6%, and iron 5%. The researcher who headed up the study theorizes that the plant's increased yield could cause those nutrients to be, as NBC News puts it, diluted. That could mean that people would need to ingest more calories from these crops to get the same amount of nutrients, or that they'll eat the same amount and suffer from iron and zinc deficiencies, something NPR reports 2 billion people around the planet already experience. The former negatively impacts kids' IQ; the latter hampers the immune system. But researchers are working to solve the problem. They hope to create more nutrient-filled crop varieties through plant breeding; they've already succeeded with some rice and wheat varieties, though a USDA researcher says doing is a formidable challenge.

Original Story:  – Police in Benbrook, Texas, responded to a 911 call on Thursday and found a tragic scene: the two young daughters of a celebrated concert pianist dead in their beds, and his estranged wife stabbed. The specifics of what may have happened became only slightly less opaque during a Friday press conference in which the Benbrook PD said Vadym Kholodenko placed the 911 call at 9:27am, just minutes after he arrived to pick up the children. "He found the mother in an extreme state of distress and discovered the children," says Commander David Babcock, per CBS Fort Worth. Police are waiting on autopsy results, but they say Nika, 5, and Michela, 1, were not stabbed and showed no visible injuries. Kholodenko is not a suspect; his wife and the girls' mother, 31-year-old Sofia Tsygankova, is "being held on a mental health evaluation" in a Fort Worth hospital. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports by way of court records that the Ukrainian pianist—winner of the gold medal at the 2013 Van Cliburn International Piano Competition, according to a bio—filed for divorce from Tsygankova in November, two months after the pair had apparently stopped living together as a couple. The divorce is still pending. Kholodenko had been scheduled to play three shows with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra this weekend but will be replaced, reports NBC DFW. It adds that Benbrook police have responded to calls at the house in the past, though Babcock didn't offer any specifics. Though it's unclear whether Tsygankova's wounds were self-inflicted or the result of an attack, Babcock said there is no active search for a suspect. Kholodenko said in a statement released by his lawyer that he "is experiencing great grief at this time and has no further comment. Thank you for respecting his privacy."

Original Story:  – Will she resign? That's about the only suspense left in Brazil on Thursday after the Senate voted to proceed with an impeachment trial against President Dilma Rousseff. The move means that Rousseff will be suspended from office while a trial that could last six months gets under way, reports the AP. But given the lopsided vote to proceed with the trial, 55-22, Rousseff stands little chance of prevailing in the end, reports the New York Times. She's accused of improperly borrowing from state banks—not to enrich herself personally, but to cover up budget shortfalls to improve her re-election prospects in about two years. “Given the polarization in Brazil, if she sticks to her guns and fights this all the way to the end, it’s going to prolong the agony for the country,” says a professor of international management at the University of Pennsylvania. "The best thing she could do for her country is to bite the bullet and step aside." Rousseff will be replaced as president in the interim by Vice President Michel Temer. Stories and headlines suggest that Rousseff already has been "impeached" because of Thursday's vote, but there's disagreement about that in legal circles, notes the Times. “In Brazil, the term impeachment is used only after a conviction is made in the trial,” says a law professor in Rio de Janeiro.
Original Summary:  President Dilma Rousseff faces an impeachment trial in Brazil after the Senate voted to proceed with the process, with a vote of 55-22. Despite her efforts to fight the impeachment, Rousseff is unlikely to prevail and will be suspended from office during the six-month trial, with Vice President Michel Temer taking over as interim president.

Original Story:  – The controversial Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act has passed the House, despite privacy concerns and a veto threat from the White House. CISPA, designed to make it easier for companies and the government to share information about cybersecurity threats, passed 248-168, which isn't a big enough margin to override a veto, Politico reports. Some 42 Democrats backed the bill, while 28 Republicans voted against it. The bill—dubbed son of SOPA by critics—was backed by Internet firms, including Facebook and Microsoft, but firmly opposed by privacy groups. The co-chairs of the House privacy caucus called CISPA "unacceptable," and urged lawmakers to vote against it, reports the Washington Post. "In its current form, this legislation would allow companies to share personal information about consumers with other companies, even if that information has nothing to do with cybersecurity," they said in a statement. The measure would "also free companies from liability if they share this personal, sensitive information." ProPublica has more on the bill.

Original Story:  – Colin Kaepernick's collusion case against the NFL is progressing, with an unnamed league source telling ESPN that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, Texans owner Bob McNair, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and others are being asked to turn over cellphone records and emails. Others, including Seahawks owner Paul Allen and 49ers owner Jed York, will be deposed in the case, the source says. The owners are being involved due to public statements they made about Kaepernick or NFL players protesting. Kaepernick filed a grievance under the NFL collective bargaining agreement claiming he was deprived "of employment rights in retaliation" for his "advocacy for equality and social justice and his bringing awareness to peculiar institutions still undermining racial equality" in the US. “Every day that goes by and he doesn’t get signed is another nail in the NFL’s defense,” the Washington Post quotes Kaepernick's attorney as saying. For many sportswriters, Kaepernick's point was further proven this week when Texans rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson tore his ACL during practice and the team chose to bring in Matt McGloin and TJ Yates. "The NFL is blackballing Colin Kapernick ... for political reasons," argues Bleacher Report, which calls McGloin "some rando from the quarterback scrap heap" who "throws like a coaching assistant." For the Win states Kaepernick "would have been perfect" for the Texans offense, while Yates "is pretty much useless." But Kaepernick will need to do more than be a better quarterback than those getting gigs; he must prove teams actively conspired with each other or the league itself to keep him from getting an offer.

Original Story:  – With the idea of 3D-printed guns already causing controversy, the city of Philadelphia apparently doesn't want to take any chances. The city council this week voted to make such guns illegal, reports NBC Philadelphia. Once Mayor Michael Nutter signs off, that will make Philadelphia the first city in the nation to enact a law against 3D guns, notes Philadelphia Magazine. The magazine sounds a wee bit skeptical of the benefit, however, considering that no printers of 3D guns are known to exist in the city. "It’s all pre-emptive," an aide to the legislator behind the measure tells the publication. "It’s just based upon Internet stuff out there." The law would not apply to licensed gun manufacturers but is instead aimed at criminals who might try to print a cheap, undetectable (no metal) firearm. Sen. Chuck Schumer wants a federal law to the same effect. A blogger at Reason points out that the city's law might conflict with a state law protecting gun rights, while a blogger at Gizmodo thinks the focus on 3D guns "distracts us from the very big problems we still have with conventional weapons."

Original Story:  – A member of Canada's parliament got caught with his pants down yesterday. As the House of Commons voted on a procedural motion, Pat Martin voted, then dashed out of the chamber unexpectedly before returning a short while later. When a Conservative Party MP suggested he should forfeit his vote—MPs aren't to leave the chamber during a vote—the New Democratic Party member gave this response: "They had men's underwear on for half price and I bought a bunch that was clearly too small for me. I find it difficult to sit for any length of time." Cheers and laughter ensued, and his vote was allowed to stand. Martin later told CBC News it was a joke and that he actually left his seat to talk to the House Speaker. But since "some Conservative MP got his knickers in a knot, I think, about the fact that I stepped away from my chair for a couple of seconds ... I believe that his point of order was tongue in cheek and it warranted a cheeky response." More cheeky responses are spreading on Twitter, like this one: "Well, I guess he is not the only MP who needed to be debriefed before an important vote in Parliament." The Toronto Star notes Martin himself had nothing to say on Twitter: He stopped tweeting in 2012 after calling Conservative MPs "rat faced whores."

Original Story:  – Donna Brazile, former head of the Democratic National Committee, made headlines Thursday when she accused the Clinton campaign and DNC of "unethical" behavior and "rigging" the primary in favor of Hillary Clinton. While not containing much new, provable information, Brazile's allegation is equivalent to "taking the smoldering embers of the 2016 primary and throwing some gasoline on them," Aaron Blake writes for the Washington Post. He says the allegations "could lead to some further soul-searching and even bloodletting in the Democratic Party" and could ruin the tenuous unity the Democrats built up in the face of the Trump presidency. Here's what else you need to know about Brazile's bombshell: New York disagrees, stating Brazile's account is "remarkable ... for the substance of its allegations and the melodramatic tenor of its prose." It argues one of the big takeaways is that Brazile believes the future of the Democratic Party is with Bernie Sanders and that she may be positioning herself for a role with the Sanders 2020 campaign.

Original Story:  – An allegedly cheating husband who got in trouble after using his wife's iPhone to book an Uber blames the app for the end of his marriage and is suing for $45 million, the Daily Dot reports. The businessman says that after he logged into his own Uber account on his wife's phone and then logged out again, a glitch in the app caused her to keep receiving notifications whenever he used the service, arousing her suspicions that he was having an affair and leading her to file for divorce, reports Le Figaro. The first hearing in the case is scheduled for March. "Uber doesn’t publicly comment on individual cases, and especially those which concern things such as a divorce procedure," the company said in a statement. The Local predicts that the glitch could lead to similar lawsuits, though not from Android users: The problem appears to be confined to iPhone iOS versions of the Uber app that were updated after Dec. 16 last year. (CEO Travis Kalanick dropped out of President Trump's economic advisory council after a recent Uber boycott.)

Original Story:  – Within the span of days, Tessie Sylvester lost her husband to ALS and was diagnosed with cancer. But the Minneapolis mother of two isn't focusing on the unfairness of it all. "I’m not ready to give into it," she tells WCCO. John Sylvester, a former Minnesota Thunder soccer player, died June 16 after a six-year battle with the disease. "He kept telling me, 'It's going to be OK, it’s going to be OK,'" Tessie Sylvester says. But she never told her dying husband she had cancer—news she had gotten days earlier. "I was literally on the phone with the funeral director, and the other line beeped and it was my doctor," she says. Tessie Sylvester is self-employed and self-insured, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The adenocarcinoma is attacking the 36-year-old's liver and lymph nodes, and she won't be able to work while undergoing chemotherapy. And more than that, she wants to spend as much time as possible with her sons, ages 5 and 6, who she's afraid of leaving without parents. "It’s been scary," Sylvester tells KMSP. "That's probably the best word for it." A GoFundMe page set up to help the family has raised more than $140,000 in four days. And Sylvester hopes she'll have another source of help, too. "I think John went when he did because he knew that I needed some protection from another place," she tells WCCO. (This mom beat cancer while pregnant but died a day after birth.)

Original Story:  – When it comes to taking property that isn’t theirs, burglars are facing some stiff competition: law enforcement officers. In 2014, the Washington Post reports, the federal Treasury and Justice departments accumulated more than $5 billion via civil asset forfeiture—the controversial practice of law enforcement seizing cash and property from people, even if those people haven’t been convicted (or charged, for that matter) with a crime. During that same period, losses attributed to burglary came in at just under $4 billion, the FBI reports. The comparison (the first time civil asset forfeiture has come in ahead of burglary in these statistics) was first reported on the Armstrong Economics blog. There are, however, some caveats. The Post points out that the sum of property lost to all types of theft—not just burglary—in 2014 was about $12.3 billion. Also, a large portion of the total income from civil asset forfeiture may be from a handful of high-dollar cases in 2014, such as the $1.7 billion Bernie Madoff judgment—and some money, in cases like those, goes back to victims. But, even when looking at a more stable indicator to account for things like payments to victims, the forfeiture number hit $4.5 billion last year. State and local police also use civil asset forfeiture, and according to the Institute for Justice, the 14 states for which there were reliable data collected $250 million in 2013. Figures like these have fueled critics' calls to do away with the practice—originally a tool for the war on drugs—altogether. Several states have either passed or are discussing civil asset forfeiture reforms, the Daily Signal notes.
Original Summary:  Law enforcement agencies in the US accumulated over $5 billion in assets through civil asset forfeiture in 2014, more than the $4 billion lost to burglary, according to the FBI. However, the majority of this amount comes from a few high-dollar cases, and some goes back to victims, so the more stable indicator of $4.5 billion is a better measure of the practice's impact.

Original Story:  – The city of La Cruces, NM, has agreed to pay $3 million to settle a federal civil lawsuit brought by a woman who was sexually assaulted by a police detective when she was a high-school intern with the department. During the trial, Diana Guerrero, who had aspired to become a police officer, told the court, "It had never occurred to me that a person who had earned a badge would do this," the AP reports, noting Guerrero agreed to be named. According to a Justice Department press release, former Las Cruces police Detective Michael Garcia took Guerrero, then 17, on a ride-along to visit a crime scene in May 2011. Rather than take her directly back to the station, he "drove her to a secluded location where he sexually assaulted her." The press release notes he was "assigned to a unit that focused on child abuse and sex crimes investigations" at the time. Garcia, who pleaded guilty, was sentenced to nine years in prison in late 2014. Guerrero reported the assault, which left her feeling "like a piece of trash" in 2013, after bumping into a female detective that year who asked why she had ended the internship. "I just blurted it out," Guerrero told KVIA. "I am most happy and satisfied that this lawsuit brought to light a cesspool of sexual violence and harassment that exists in police departments across this country," Guerrero tells the AP. Indeed, an investigation by the news outlet found that, during a six-year period, about 1,000 officers were fired for a range of sex crimes; it calls that number "unquestionably an undercount." The City Council still has to approve the settlement, according to KRWG, which is expected to happen Monday. KVIA reports Guerrero now intends to pursue a career in nutrition.

Original Story:  – Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein picked up a humanitarian award this week from the Museum of Tolerance, notes Variety, and he delivered a message about anti-Semitism that shows his particular brand of tolerance is, well, Weinstein-esque. "We better stand up and kick these guys in the ass," he said, as quoted by the Hollywood Reporter. "We're gonna have to get as organized as the mafia," he added, citing a quote from the Kurt Vonnegut novel the Sirens of Titan. "We just can't take it anymore [from] these crazy bastards." Weinstein, speaking at the Simon Wiesenthal Center's National Tribute Dinner, said Jews must "get together with the Muslims who are honorable and peaceful," but also protect themselves against extremists around the world.

Original Story:  – Could Texas turn blue? The state hasn't gone for a Democratic president since Jimmy Carter, but lots of political stories are taking note of Donald Trump's slim lead in the polls over Hillary Clinton. The gist of most: Trump is still expected to win, but it's going to be close. Some coverage: Trump is up by just 3 points in the latest poll from the University of Texas and the Texas Tribune. The breakdown is here. One of his biggest problems this year in the state? Suburban Republican women. NPR takes a look. Another Trump problem? Latino voters. "Trump’s potential effect on Hispanic turnout is at the heart of Republican worries," observes Politico. A story at CNN may cheer Republicans looking at the big picture. It suggests the closeness is a "one-time phenomenon" that can be blamed on Trump's alienation of large swaths of voters. And a lengthy assessment from the Texas Politics Project crunches a slew of factors to conclude: "There is good reason to believe that polling is finding Texas leaning Republican rather than the solid Republican state it has been in presidential elections for most of the last three decades. But the change in its tilt doesn’t necessarily mean it’s ready to fall the other direction without still more shaking at the foundations.” The New York Times sums up: Yes, "there is widespread disenchantment with Mr. Trump among Texas Republicans, but Mrs. Clinton remains unpopular in parts of the state. She is seen as an establishment politician and regarded as an anti-gun abortion rights supporter in an anti-establishment, anti-abortion and pro-gun state. And she is tied to President Obama, who lost Texas in 2012 by nearly 1.3 million votes." Last month, the Dallas Morning News endorsed Clinton, its first Democratic pick in 75 years. Story here.

Original Story:  – A Republican congressman from New York lost approximately $17 million Tuesday when the stock value of an Australian biotech firm cratered, Politico reports. It's unclear how much money was lost by his fellow lawmakers, who he convinced to buy into the firm. Rep. Chris Collins is the largest shareholder and sits on the board of Innate Immunotherapeutics. On Tuesday, Innate stock dropped more than 90% after the firm announced its multiple sclerosis drug was a failure in clinical trials. According to CNBC, Innate stock hit a peak of $1.77 per share in January; it closed at 5 cents Tuesday. “For those that invested in Innate including me, we all were sophisticated investors who were aware of the inherent risk," Collins says. Collins' actual, not-just-on-paper loss is the just over $5 million he invested in Innate about 15 years ago; he hadn't sold any of his Innate stock prior to Tuesday's crash, the Buffalo News reports. The other lawmakers Collins successfully convinced to buy Innate stock are Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Bill Long of Missouri, Mike Conway of Texas, and Doug Lamborn of Colorado. The Office of Congressional Ethics is investigating Collins for possible insider trading. He helped write legislation to speed up clinical trials that could have benefited Innate in theory. Collins, who says he's still "hopeful" Innate can develop a successful MS drug, was worth a reported $40 million prior to Tuesday's stock debacle.

Original Story:  – WikiLeaks has dumped its new trove of classified military documents, cataloging the Iraqi war's heavy toll on civilians, the systematic abuse of detainees by Iraqi police as the US looked the other way, and evidence that Iran has been helping anti-US militias more than has been acknowledged. The whistle-blowing site plans a news conference tomorrow about the 392,000 files, thought to be the biggest such release ever. Details are emerging fast and furious from the media outlets that were granted a preview. Click the links for overviews in the New York Times, the Guardian, and Der Spiegel. Among the threads emerging: Iraqi authorities brutally abused detainees while the US took no action because coalition troops were not involved. (Story here.) The US kept track of Iraqi deaths, despite its denials, logging 109,000 between 2004 and 2009, with 66,000 of those civilians. (Story here.) Most civilian deaths came at the hands of fellow Iraqis, but the documents highlight previously unreported incidents in which US soldiers were to blame. (Story here.) Iran's military has been aggressively helping Shiite militias, with Iranian troops sometimes engaging US soldiers. (Story here.)

Original Story:  – When Santa Barbara High School principal John Becchio stepped into his office Tuesday morning, he was greeted by a strange sight: a four-piece mariachi band. "What are you doing here?" he asked, but by way of explanation, he had to endure an hour-plus of music as he walked the school's halls—the butt of a senior class joke, the Los Angeles Times reports. A video of the hoopla—uploaded to YouTube by a school district staffer—has now gone viral, with more than half a million views in two days. "I didn't think it would take off the way it did," said Becchio, who arrived to school the day before to find his possessions had been shrink-wrapped. "It was kind of a special send-off." The school district added, per KLTV, "It was a senior prank that delighted students and staff." Apparently Becchio should be thankful the entertainment lasted only a short time. Last year, students of West Linn High School in Oregon pulled the same trick on their principal, only the music lasted three hours, Today reports. (Officials at this New Jersey high school weren't as impressed with their school's senior prank, which ended in 62 arrests.)
Original Summary:  Santa Barbara High School principal John Becchio was surprised by a mariachi band in his office on Tuesday morning, which played music for over an hour as a senior class prank.

Original Story:  – Not surprising: a 10-year-old boy proclaiming, "This is fun!" as he zips around town behind the wheel of his mom's Jeep Grand Cherokee. Even less surprising: the mom getting arrested for allegedly letting him do so. Per the Connecticut Post and Hartford Courant, that's what police say recently happened in Monroe, where locals called in to report a video on Facebook in which the boy was seen at the wheel of 38-year-old Lisa Nussbaum's car, cruising around the neighborhood while his mother apparently live-streamed from the passenger seat. Cops say the underage driver, who didn't seem to be sporting a seatbelt in the video, appeared to drive at a reasonable speed as his mother was heard offering directions. The Monroe PD says Nussbaum was arrested and charged with risk of injury or impairing morals of a minor and subsequently released, per WTNH; she's set to appear in court on Friday.

Original Story:  – The Philadelphia 76ers are investigating whether team president Bryan Colangelo used a variety of Twitter accounts to anonymously trash some of his own players and fellow executives and defend himself against criticism from fans and the sports media, the AP reports. The allegations were reported by the sports website The Ringer, which said it had been monitoring the accounts since February, when it received an anonymous tip. It said it found numerous connections among the accounts that suggested the same person was behind them. The five accounts under suspicion took aim at Philadelphia players Joel Embiid and Markelle Fultz, former Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie, Toronto Raptors executive Masai Ujiri, and former Sixers players Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel. Among other things, the accounts complained that Embiid, the 24-year-old All-Star center, was "playing like a toddler having tantrums" and was "a bit lazy," ''selfish," and "acting like a tool." The user of one of the accounts claimed to know Colangelo and described him more than once as a "class act." Colangelo acknowledged using one of the accounts to monitor the NBA industry and other current events but said he wasn't familiar with the four others. The Ringer said it initially asked the Sixers about just two of the accounts, and the same day the three others were suddenly made private. Embiid, Philly's franchise star, made a few wisecracks about the furor for his 1.4 million Twitter followers before standing up for Colangelo. "All jokes asides I don't believe the story," he tweeted. "That would be just insane."

Original Story:  – Clay Shephard died on May 17, and the obituary for the 23-year-old from Apex, NC, clearly shows the love his family had for him, listing his "intelligence, confidence, athletic ability, height, beautiful blue eyes, broad smile, fantastic wit, and the ability to engage and forge a relationship with anyone." But the Shephards were also determined not to sugarcoat how he died, penning what WNCN calls a "heart-wrenching" death notice that details how Shephard succumbed to his drug addiction: "Our charismatic and beautiful son and brother died Sunday morning from a drug overdose. Outwardly Clay looked like he had it all. … Inwardly Clay was sensitive and had struggles that he hid well from his close and clannish family. … While we always felt we had some grip on Clay's issues, his ability to hide and disguise his addiction proved superior to our parental (and sibling) sixth sense." The blunt openness of the obituary—which also notes the close relationship he shared with his dad, a mention of the last "I love you" text he sent to his mom, and a call to all other parents to keep tabs on their kids—has been adopted in other recent obits of young people who struggled with drugs. "This note isn't an attempt to assign blame for Clay's death," Shephard's family writes. "It's not to vent our anger and frustration at a world where drugs can be ordered and delivered through the internet. We write this obituary in hope that it may provide an insight to those that need to change their behavior one night at a time." That hope has affected at least one family so far. In a recent letter in the News & Observer, Paul and Lorelei Milan say, "As parents of teenagers, we plan to read Clay's obituary at the dinner table and have an open, honest discussion of the reality of drugs and how it can spiral out of control very fast."

Original Story:  – A Black Lives Matter protester locked horns with Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Birmingham, Ala., on Saturday, and neither one of them emerged very happy from the encounter, reports the Washington Post. Mercutio Southall Jr., who the Post describes as a well-known activist and the founder of the Birmingham chapter of Black Lives Matter, began chanting at a Trump rally, prompting Trump to tell security to "Get him the hell out of here, will you, please?" A scuffle apparently ensued as security moved to remove Southall, cell phone video was recorded, and Southall emerged saying that he had been roughed up considerably as well as been called racial slurs. A woman in the video shouts repeatedly, "don't choke him!" "I got punched in the face, I got punched in the neck. I got kicked in the chest. Kicked in the stomach. Somebody stepped on my hand," Southall tells CNN. A Trump rep on Saturday said "the campaign does not condone this behavior," but Trump himself appeared less apologetic in comments Sunday, per CNN. Southall "was so obnoxious and so loud, he was screaming. I had 10,000 people in the room yesterday, 10,000 people, and this guy started screaming by himself and they—I don't know, rough up, he should have been—maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing," Trump said. Southall, for his part, says he intends to press charges.

Original Story:  – "We don't have the right to say it's too difficult to read." That's what Beverley Chalmers says about her book Birth, Sex and Abuse: Women's Voices Under Nazi Rule, which chronicles the "horrific" experiences endured by both Jewish and non-Jewish women as the Third Reich pursued its agenda to create a master race. It took the 65-year-old Canadian more than a decade to research and write the book, the Times of Israel reports. After poring over more than 600 books and articles and searching WWII-related archives in Israel, the US, and the UK, Chalmers has put together a comprehensive account of the brutality suffered by women, including rape, disfigurement, forced abortion even in the ninth month, sterilization through X-rays, and experimentation. As the Times notes, it's a topic that often has been "sanitized." “Survivors didn’t talk about anything having to do with sex because they didn’t want their children and grandchildren to know what had happened to them,” says Chalmers. Birth, Sex and Abuse is "a library within a library," Marcia Weiss Posner writes in a review for the Jewish Book Council. "Each word, each bit of information is precious and unlikely to be found elsewhere with such clarity and comprehensiveness." A review at Oxford Journals says the book helps show how "the Nazis aimed at the destruction of the Jewish race partially through ideologically driven attacks on women’s reproduction." Many non-Jewish women also suffered under the Nazis (their babies were taken from them; they were forced into prostitution; and the government encouraged their husbands to divorce them if they couldn't bear children). However, Chalmers tells the Times, "The Jewish experience was horrifically unspeakable." (A photo of a woman standing up to neo-Nazis is the talk of Sweden.)

Original Story:  – The US has seen its first Ebola diagnosis, but there's no reason to panic, officials say: "There's all the difference in the world between the US and parts of Africa where Ebola is spreading," notes CDC director Thomas Frieden. "There is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here." The AP, New York Times, and NBC 5 offer guidelines on understanding the situation in Dallas: What we know about the patient: He's a male who flew from Liberia to Dallas, but that's about all we know. Officials haven't revealed whether he's a US citizen. It's unknown how he became infected, but it was confirmed that he's not a health worker. Others on the patient's plane won't get sick: The patient in question arrived in the US on Sept. 20, but he didn't begin to experience symptoms until Sept. 24. That means officials aren't worried about others on the plane. "Ebola doesn't spread till someone gets sick, and he didn't get sick for four days," Frieden says. Who may be at risk: The patient has been in isolation, and officials are seeking the "handful" of people with whom he had close contact beforehand, including family members and community members. The disease only spreads via contact with a patient's bodily fluids; it doesn't travel through the air. Those at risk will have their symptoms checked every day for three weeks. Dallas can handle the patient: The Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital says it's "well prepared" to take care of him; he won't need to be moved to an isolation unit elsewhere. He'll be treated using IV nutrition, hydration, and possibly an experimental drug or a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor, Frieden says. This may not be the only traveler with Ebola: Screening processes in the affected region involve checking passengers for fever, but those without symptoms could slip through. If any are later found to be infected on or after a flight, the CDC will be on the case. How doctors distinguish Ebola from the flu: In the beginning they may look the same, but things get bad fast with Ebola, explains one doctor, "from you just got the flu to you're really, really sick, high-grade fever, vomiting, diarrhea."

Original Story:  – "Sunlight is the best disinfectant," said Bill Maher earlier this week in a New York Times interview in which he took some credit for triggering the downfall of Milo Yiannopoulos, whose Friday night appearance on Maher's HBO show brought the host an avalanche of criticism. Now, some sunlight is streaming Maher's way, courtesy of Mediaite, which resurfaced a video from 1998 in which Maher himself speaks favorably about an instance of pedophilia. As Mediaite reports, the then-host of Politically Incorrect on ABC was discussing the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, the Seattle teacher who went to prison after becoming pregnant by a 12-year-old student. A key line: "She is in jail because she is in love. That’s how I view it." He continued, saying he will admit "that it's unorthodox," per the Washington Post. But "they're keeping the mother in jail because she won’t conform to what society feels should be the perfect American family." And he really continued: Mediaite reports he commented on the case as recently as 2007, when he told Playboy, "I'm the only guy I’ve ever heard who defends Mary Kay Letourneau." He also referenced the similar case of Debra LaFave, which involved a 14-year-old student, saying: "The crime is that we didn’t get it on videotape. Was he being taken advantage of? I wish I had been taken advantage of like that. What a memory she gave him!" USA Today observes that "defending the seemingly indefensible was one of Maher's comic themes ... on Politically Incorrect." Maher has yet to comment.

Original Story:  – Americans are already experiencing the harmful effects of climate change, and those effects will get worse unless something is done, according to a new National Climate Assessment issued today. The report cites increased instances of extreme weather, droughts, and heat waves as evidence of climate change's impact, and presents evidence that human activities are driving that impact, the LA Times reports. "The overall message is that climate change is happening right now—we can't think of it as an issue for future generations," one lead author says. If nothing is done, the report predicts that the Northeast and Midwest will be hit with more downpours and flooding, while the Great Plains will see more droughts, and the Southwest more wildfire and extreme heatwaves. Compiled by more than 240 experts, the assessment is the third such report, and is mandated by Congress every four years. President Obama will mark the occasion by meeting with meteorologists to discuss the findings, CNN reports.

Original Story:  – An unarmed black teenager was shot and killed by Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman on Feb. 26, and Zimmerman has yet to be charged; now Reuters reports that the FBI is monitoring the controversial Sanford, Florida, case, which has garnered nationwide attention. Trayvon Martin, 17, was walking through a gated community back to his stepmother's house after going out to buy candy for his brother when Zimmerman called 911 to report a suspicious person. Zimmerman—who has called police 46 times since the beginning of 2011, the Miami Herald reports—was told by a dispatcher not to follow Martin, but did so anyway; he told authorities he shot the teen in self-defense. Martin's family has called for federal authorities to take over the case, and civil rights leaders have noted their alarm—Zimmerman, 28, is white, and reportedly specifically warned residents about unfamiliar black youth, although his father called him a "Spanish-speaking minority" in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel. Martin's family said Friday they would ask to meet with Attorney General Eric Holder. ABC, which notes that Zimmerman was never tested for drugs or alcohol the night Martin died, has Zimmerman's recently released 911 call as well as calls from others who witnessed the shooting. The Herald has more on Zimmerman as well as the Sanford police department, which has a history of racial tensions. The Sentinel notes that Florida college students are planning a rally this morning outside the criminal courts building where prosecutors are reviewing the case.

Original Story:  – In not-so-surprising news, the Venezuelan government said today that Hugo Chavez is too sick to attend his own inauguration on Thursday, reports the BBC. So now what? Chavez's camp says it's no big deal, arguing that the swearing-in is a mere formality that can be postponed until Chavez is well enough to travel. But the opposition thinks the constitution makes clear that if the incoming president can't be sworn in, the National Assembly leader must form a caretaker government and call new elections. It wants the nation's Supreme Court to settle the dispute. "The Supreme Court has to take a position on what the text of the constitution says," says opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who lost to Chavez in the fall election. "There is no monarchy here, and we aren't in Cuba." The National Assembly leader, for his part, says he has no intention of taking over on Thursday, reports CNN. "When (the opposition) talks about a power vacuum, they are proposing a coup."

Original Story:  – The UK's interference with the Guardian's Snowden reporting apparently goes deeper than just the detention of Glenn Greenwald's partner. In a new opinion piece in the Guardian, editor Alan Rusbridger says that over the course of the past two months, the British government repeatedly demanded "the return or destruction of all the material we were working on" in regards to the Snowden leaks. He refused, and so, as he tells it: "... one of the more bizarre moments in the Guardian's long history occurred—with two GCHQ security experts overseeing the destruction of hard drives in the Guardian's basement just to make sure there was nothing in the mangled bits of metal which could possibly be of any interest to passing Chinese agents. 'We can call off the black helicopters,' joked one as we swept up the remains of a MacBook Pro." (Reuters spoke with a source who clarified that the security experts watched as the hard drives were destroyed.) Though Rusbridger promises the paper will continue "patient, painstaking reporting on the Snowden documents," he warns that in this digital age, "it may not be long before it will be impossible for journalists to have confidential sources." Until then, he jokes, "at least reporters now know to stay away from Heathrow transit lounges."

Original Story:  – In what a Utah boy's father calls a "Christmas miracle," the 8-year-old is "awake and coherent" after spending up to 30 minutes submerged in an icy pond on Christmas Day. The Washington County Sheriff's Office says the boy, identified only as Jason, is "doing very well" after a dramatic rescue, NBC News reports. The boy, who fell through ice 25 feet from shore while chasing his dog, was rescued by a sheriff's deputy who removed his police gear and entered the pond instead of waiting for a dive team. In a statement, the boy's family thanked the public for the "prayers and thoughtful messages they have received during this difficult time." After the rescue in New Harmony, Jason was airlifted to a hospital. "The father said Jason's situation has been an example to their family that 'God hears and answers prayers,'" the sheriff's office said, per Deseret News. The office said Jason has been responding to questions from family members and hospital staff. Sgt. Aaron Thompson, the officer who pulled the boy from the pond, says he "just made the decision" to go in the water. He was treated for cuts and hypothermia. Sheriff Cory Pulsipher tells the Spectrum that Thompson is a hero. "A lot of people would probably like to think they would have dived in too, but how many actually would have?" the sheriff says. "He hates having the spotlight on him, but he's a hero."

Original Story:  – Jeffrey Daday apparently liked to dip his hand into the cash register. Or more specifically, into parking meters. The New York man worked as a parking enforcement officer for five years in the village of Mount Kisco and stole $89,000 in coins over that time, police tell the Journal News. Count that out: That's 356,000 quarters, 890,000 dimes, or 1.78 million nickels—enough for eight months of parking. Police say Daday, 36, admitted to the theft, which was carried out between January 2009 and May 2014, after officers confronted him as he was leaving a bank. A police surveillance team began monitoring Daday after local council officials realized a good chunk of change had disappeared, the Daily Mail reports. Authorities say they spotted the enforcement officer heading directly to People's United Bank to make a deposit, rather than to the local council office, after emptying the meters. He has since pleaded guilty to grand larceny and offering a false instrument for filing and could see up to 15 years behind bars.

Original Story:  – This might be the worst date in Tinder history. Or the worst date in history, period. Two Brits were on a first date when the woman reportedly went to use her date's bathroom, only to soon find herself in that most terrifying situation: Her poo wouldn't flush. So she allegedly went with plan B: removing the poop, wrapping it in toilet paper, tossing it out the window, and, perhaps less explicitly, telling date Liam Smith what she just did. As Smith explains in a GoFundMe campaign (more on that in just a minute), "I was understandably concerned," but suggested they go outside, retrieve it, put it in the trash, and "pretend the whole sorry affair had never happened." But the plan was thwarted by a "design quirk" in which the bathroom window was made up of two non-opening windows—and the feces was stuck in there. And, soon, so was she. Smith's date decided to climb in head-first from the top of the window and reach to the bottom to retrieve the poo. Which, amazingly, she reportedly did. But then she found herself stuck—and ultimately had to be rescued by firefighters, who broke the window in the process. Smith took to GoFundMe in a quest to raise some of the funds needed for what he says is about a $400 replacement cost. He has nearly raised $2,500, and says the excess will be split between a charity that brings toilets to the developing world and a firefighters charity. For the skeptical, Avon Fire and Rescue service did confirm to the BBC that it rescued a woman trapped between two windows, with the Telegraph confirming the call was made regarding Smith's address at 10:41pm on Aug. 7. Smith posted photos documenting the ordeal on what Gizmodo has christened "the world's best GoFundMe." (Or is this the worst first date ever?)

Original Story:  – A sex assault and harassment probe at a Texas Air Force base has been expanded to 15 instructors, and the number of possible victims is now up to 38. "There may be others as we continue the investigation" at the Lackland base in San Antonio, said an Air Force spokesman. "We’ve always known this is just the tip of the iceberg,” said the founder of a group that supports sexual trauma victims in the military. “In all likelihood we are just beginning to document how horrible this problem really is.” A military jury last week sentenced former instructor Staff Sgt. Luis Walker to 20 years in prison for the rape of one trainee and sexual assault of several others. The counts against Walker were the most severe so far in the probe. Four other instructors currently face court martial charges concerning sex and recruits. To date, the Air Force has permanently removed 36 instructors for reasons including misconduct, failure to meet standards, and "medical issues," reports the San Antonio Express. "We have said from the outset of these investigations that we will investigate every lead, and we don’t know who or how many instances of unprofessional conduct may turn up,” said an Air Force spokesman. All Air Force recruits go through basic training at Lackland. The base has some 500 instructors, most of them male, for 35,000 recruits annually. One in five of the trainees are female, notes AP.

"We have said from the outset of these investigations that we will investigate every lead, and we don’t know who or how many instances of unprofessional conduct may turn up,” said an Air Force spokesman. All Air Force recruits go through basic training at Lackland. The base has some 500 instructors, most of them male, for 35,000 recruits annually. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. One in five of the trainees are female, notes AP. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators.
Injected Summary:  An investigation into sexual assault and harassment at a Texas Air Force base has expanded to 15 instructors and may involve up to 38 possible victims. The Air Force has permanently removed 36 instructors due to misconduct, failure to meet standards, and medical issues, and a military jury sentenced a former instructor to 20 years in prison for rape and sexual assault.

Original Story:  – They were mostly between the ages of 14 and 18, and 26 of them are now dead. CNN reports on the latest tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea and describes an appalling scene: teenage girls' bodies floating lifelessly beside a nearly submerged rubber dinghy that survivors tried to cling to. The AFP reports 23 of the bodies were recovered Friday, with another three subsequently found. Their remains were brought ashore in Salerno, Italy; Salvatore Malfi, the police prefect there, tells NPR they appear to have drowned, but the bodies will be autopsied Tuesday to determine cause of death as well as whether the girls had been sexually abused. The BBC reports some are questioning whether the girls, believed to hail from Niger and Nigeria, were abused and murdered. They were en route to Europe via Libya, which CNN calls "a hotbed for human traffickers." The AFP quotes Malfi as apparently trying to tamp down on that line of thought: "The sex trafficking routes are different. Loading women onto a boat is too risky, the traffickers would not do it as they could lose all their 'goods'—as they describe them—in one fell swoop." Per the UN's migration agency, the migrant death toll along the main Mediterranean route stands at 2,639 for the year through Nov. 1, versus 3,615 for the same period last year. (This smuggler reportedly deliberately drowned 50 migrants.)

Original Story:  – The United States and several leading EU states appear poised to increase non-lethal aid to Syrian opposition groups, adding equipment such as body armor and night-vision goggles, reports the Wall Street Journal. Arms, however, remain off the table, as President Obama fears they could fall into the hands of al-Qaeda-affiliated groups. The White House is also reviewing military options, such as bombing Syrian aircraft on the ground or adding Patriot anti-missile batteries to Turkey to defend against Syrian rockets. “It’s not going to turn the tide in the battle, but of course it helps,” one analyst tells the New York Times. Over in Europe, there are signs Britain and France are interested in stepping up their assistance to rebel groups by letting the EU arms embargo against Syria expire at the end of May. At a Group of Eight meeting in London yesterday, Syrian opposition groups once again called for increased military assistance, asking for antiaircraft and antitank guns. The news comes as Human Rights Watch declares more than 4,300 civilians have been killed in government airstrikes since July, Al Jazeera adds.

Original Story:  – The jury in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial is deadlocked, the AP reports. After 30 hours of deliberation over four days, jurors told Judge Steven O'Neill they could not reach a unanimous verdict on any of the three counts of aggravated indecent assault. O'Neill instructed them to keep trying and sent them back to the jury room, where they have been working late into the night while sequestered. Reuters reports they worked 12-hour days Tuesday and Wednesday since getting the case late Monday. Upon hearing the jury's note to the judge, Cosby's lawyers requested a mistrial, but O'Neill said that request was premature. Jurors have requested to revisit key evidence multiple times, which at times has seemed to "vex" O'Neill, per the AP (one batch of testimony jurors wanted to review had not been transcribed yet, for example), but on Wednesday he praised the jury for having "taken your task so seriously." The jurors, too, have seemed "angry and frustrated" at times over the course of deliberations, per the AP. According to BuzzFeed, Cosby "grinned" as the judge read the jury's note and announced jurors were deadlocked. At least one of Cosby's other accusers cried after the note was read.

Original Story:  – A former SS guard is on trial for allegedly serving as an accessory to hundreds of mass killings at a Nazi concentration camp, the AP reports. Johann Rehbogen, 94, isn't accused of a specific crime, but he served at Stutthof concentration camp in what is now Poland. More than 60,000 Jews and other Holocaust victims were killed there—by gas chamber, lethal injection, exposure, starvation, or simply being shot. Rehbogen, who was at the camp from 1942 to 1944, denies knowing about the killings. But others say he had to know: "Anyone who heard the screams from outside the gas chamber would have known that people were fighting for their lives," says prosecutor Andreas Brendel. As he was under 21 at the time, Rehbogen is being tried in juvenile court in Germany and faces a possible 15-year sentence—which he likely wouldn't serve if found guilty due to his age, per the BBC. He's only appearing in court for two hours at a time but seems alert when asked questions by the judge. For the grandson of one survivor, seeing Germany continue to prosecute Holocaust perpetrators is empowering: "Her being able to witness even some of this process, even from afar, is a sense of closure," says Ben Cohen of his grandmother, Judy Meisel. "To have Germany listening to her is very powerful for her." (A "hero" who foiled the Nazi's nuclear dreams is dead.)

Two people were taken to the hospital with injuries not believed to be life-threatening. This would be the fourth vehicle attack in London in less than 18 months, notes USA Today.

"I think it looked intentional—the car drove at speed and towards the barriers," witness Ewalina Ochab tells the BBC. "I was walking on the other side of the road.

Original Story:  – After the Titanic hit an iceberg on April 14, 1912, the Mackay-Bennett was dispatched from Halifax to the scene to recover bodies; it pulled 306 corpses from the water, and ended up carrying 190 of them back to Canada. But according the the ship's logs, it also brought something else home: six or seven deckchairs it found in the Atlantic. One of those chairs, described by auctioneer Andrew Aldridge as "one of the rarest types of Titanic collectible," has just sold to an unnamed UK collector for roughly $150,000. The Press Association traces the chair from the first-class promenade deck to Captain Julien Lemarteleur to a Titanic collector who owned it for the past 15 years; he says he never sat on it. Auction house Henry Aldridge and Son did better than expected: The chair was estimated to sell for no more than $120,000. In a pre-sale press release, the auction house noted that the chair is "one of only a handful of fully provenanced and documented examples in existence."

Original Story:  – A video that purports to show footage of first contact with a formerly isolated tribe on the Brazil-Peru border has been released by Brazil's FUNAI agency, along with some disturbing news from tribe members themselves. As had been hinted at in previous reports, some of the younger members say they witnessed horrific attacks on their elders, reportedly at the hands of drug traffickers and illegal loggers, reports Live Science. Experts are pleading for immediate protection to fend off what they see as a possible "genocide," reports tribal rights group Survival International. Contrasting with images in the video of young tribe members trading bananas and hanging out by the water are the tales of death and destruction relayed to an interpreter. "The majority of old people were massacred by non-Indians in Peru, who shot at them with firearms and set fire to the houses of the uncontacted," he says. So many were killed that they either got buried en masse (sometimes three to a grave) or their corpses were devoured by vultures. "If they don’t make things secure for whoever turns up there, unfortunately we’ll repeat history and we will be jointly responsible for the extermination of these people," says a FUNAI worker. (Several tribe members have reportedly contracted the flu since coming into contact with the modern world.)
Original Summary:  A video released by Brazil's FUNAI agency shows footage of a previously isolated tribe on the Brazil-Peru border, along with disturbing reports from tribe members of attacks by drug traffickers and illegal loggers. Experts are pleading for immediate protection for the tribe, warning of a possible "genocide" after reports of elderly members being massacred and the tribe's way of life threatened.

Please focus on relevant details, only answer with the summary.– A video that purports to show footage of first contact with a formerly isolated tribe on the Brazil-Peru border has been released by Brazil's FUNAI agency, along with some disturbing news from tribe members themselves. As had been hinted at in previous reports, some of the younger members say they witnessed horrific attacks on their elders, reportedly at the hands of drug traffickers and illegal loggers, reports Live Science. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. Experts are pleading for immediate protection to fend off what they see as a possible "genocide," reports tribal rights group Survival International. Contrasting with images in the video of young tribe members trading bananas and hanging out by the water are the tales of death and destruction relayed to an interpreter. "The majority of old people were massacred by non-Indians in Peru, who shot at them with firearms and set fire to the houses of the uncontacted," he says. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. So many were killed that they either got buried en masse (sometimes three to a grave) or their corpses were devoured by vultures. "If they don’t make things secure for whoever turns up there, unfortunately we’ll repeat history and we will be jointly responsible for the extermination of these people," says a FUNAI worker. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators. (Several tribe members have reportedly contracted the flu since coming into contact with the modern world.)

Original Story:  – The biggest US city to file for bankruptcy was allowed to press ahead today despite outcry from its creditors, the Wall Street Journal reports. A federal judge approved Chapter 9 protection for Stockton, Calif., saying it "will not be able to perform its obligations to its citizens" without bankruptcy restructuring. But bondholders are mad because Stockton wants to reduce its debt payments without cutting pension funds, which are scheduled to pay out millions over the next 10 years. The city of 300,000 east of San Francisco could also become a landmark case, because other areas under chapter 9, like Jefferson County, Ala., and San Bernardino, are also trying to make deals with bondholders. Bloomberg details the fruitless talks between Stockton and its creditors, but the battle may not be over: The judge ruled that bondholders can still try to stop the city's restructuring plan in the next phase of the process, the AP reports.

Original Story:  – It has been a bad week for kids in Texas, with three shootings involving children under 10 years old, one of them fatal, taking place in the space of four days, Raw Story reports. On Wednesday, a five-year-old shot his seven-year-old brother with an old rifle while the two played unsupervised in the bath. On Thursday, a two-year-old fatally shot himself in the head with his dad's handgun, while his father was busy elsewhere in the room, says Raw Story. And yesterday, an eight-year-old shot his five-year-old friend in the head with a rifle, as the two played alone in a bedroom. The boy is in a critical condition in hospital, the Denton Record-Chronicle reports. Two of the guns used were .22-caliber rifles, similar to the one with which a five-year-old accidentally killed his two-year-old sister in Kentucky earlier this month. The grandfather of the children spoke out this week, saying his grandson was too young to have a gun and that it was a cultural problem in rural Kentucky. "Too many people think it's (guns) for target practice. Well, what comes after target practicing—killing. I know, I was in the Marine Corps," he told the Star Democrat. “When you pick this (gun) up, you're usually going to kill something."
Original Summary:  Three children under the age of 10 were involved in gun shootings in Texas over the course of four days, resulting in one fatality. Two of the guns used were .22-caliber rifles, similar to the one involved in an earlier accidental shooting in Kentucky, highlighting concerns about gun safety and cultural attitudes towards firearms.

Original Story:  – A UK man has been banned from driving after he pleaded guilty to switching from the driver's seat to the passenger seat of his vehicle as it traveled down a highway at 40mph. Per the BBC, Bhavesh Patel was behind the wheel of his Tesla on England's M1 motorway when he pulled the stunt, which someone in another car recorded on video. The witness reportedly posted the video to social media before police got wind of it. Patel, 39, pleaded guilty in St. Albans Crown Court to dangerous driving and was sentenced to an 18-month license suspension and 100 hours community service. Bhavesh reportedly told the court that he was simply the "unlucky one" who got caught. Per the Telegraph, Tesla said in a statement to the court that it recommends drivers using its autopilot feature remain "fully attentive" and at the wheel ready to slow down the car as they watch the road for obstacles.

Original Story:  – Looks like Barclays wasn't the only one gaming the Libor system. Investigators are looking into an alleged conspiracy in which traders around the world worked together to rig Libor to boost their personal profits, the Wall Street Journal reports. Several different groups were allegedly working to rig the rate from 2005 to 2011, with the practice spreading as traders switched banks. One cabal alone involved six of the 16 banks that set the daily yen Libor rate. Prosecutors in the US and Europe are close to arresting a number of traders over the scandal, sources tell Reuters—indeed, some of the suspects' lawyers have already been notified of impending arrests. The arrests could take pressure off the banks, making the rate-fixing look more like individual malfeasance than systematic corporate wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports that regulators from Switzerland to South Korea to Japan are looking into the possibility that their rates might be vulnerable to foul play.
Original Summary:  Investigations into Libor rate-rigging have uncovered an alleged global conspiracy among traders to manipulate the rate from 2005 to 2011, with multiple groups working together to boost personal profits. Prosecutors are close to arresting several traders, which could shift focus away from the banks and onto individual malfeasance.

Original Story:  – Surgeons in South Africa are laying clam to the world's first successful penis transplant. In the nine-hour procedure late last year, a team from Stellenbosch University and Tygerberg Hospital gave the 21-year-old recipient his new penis, and they report today in a news release that it's working properly in every way well ahead of schedule. The patient had to have his original amputated after complications from circumcision. "It's a massive breakthrough," says SU's Frank Graewe. "We've proved that it can be done—we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had." Doctors in China managed the same feat in 2006, but the procedure had to be reversed two weeks later because the penis was rejected by the patient's body, reports US News and World Report. Other reports from the time suggest the reversal was necessary because of psychological, not physical, problems. Either way, the South African operation is being hailed as the first long-term success, notes USA Today, and nine more men are scheduled to have the transplants. As you might expect, doctors say the recipient is "very happy" and is suffering no side effects. (Click to read about what a "normal" penis length is.)
