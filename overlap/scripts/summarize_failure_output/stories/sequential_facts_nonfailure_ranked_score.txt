Original Story:  – There were plenty of odd book titles last year, such as Estonian Sock Patterns All Over the World and A Taxonomy of Office Chairs. But the winner of the Diagram prize for strangest book title of the year is Cooking with Poo, reports the Guardian. Actually, Cooking with Poo is not as bizarre as it sounds—the "poo" in this case is Thai for crab, and happens to be the nickname of author Saiyuud Diwong, who runs a very popular Thai cooking program in Bangkok. Other "best" bad titles included The Great Singapore Penis Panic and Mr. Andoh's Pennine Diary: Memoirs of a Japanese Chicken Sexer in 1935 Hebden Bridge. "Given that this year the three most voted-for works contain the words 'poo,' 'sexer,' and 'penis' in the title, it appears that this year's prize will go down in history as a blue year," said Horace Bent, the keeper of the 34-year-old award.

Original Story:  – Friends and co-workers warned schoolteacher Melissa Petro that it might not be such a great idea to write about her past as a prostitute, but she did it anyway. Most recently, Melissa Petro wrote about her thoughts on the shutdown of Craigslist's "erotic services" section, which she used for four months, for the Huffington Post. Cue the New York Post's predictably juicy-sounding "exclusive" ("SEXXX ED"), in which outraged parents express their belief that, as one says, "People like that should not be allowed to be anywhere near children." The really odd thing, as New York magazine and Jezebel note, is that Petro has actually been quite open about her past for a while now, penning at least three essays about it in the past few years and even appearing in a video to talk about it. Really, none of her students “Googled their teacher to read about her sexploits” before this? wonders Chris Rovzar. Knowing kids these days, “they did Google her, and they all know about it, and they were just being chill.” Petro has been reassigned pending an investigation.

Original Story:  – Ouch: Prince William and wife Kate have been refused a meeting with New Zealand's Maori king, because they didn't offer up enough time. Wills and Kate, along with son Prince George, will be in New Zealand next month, and asked to meet with King Tuheitia for 90 minutes. But his office rejected that idea, saying 90 minutes isn't enough time to observe proper protocols, New Zealand's prime minister says, according to AFP. "It’s rather disappointing," says Prime Minister John Key, calling the offer of 90 minutes "quite generous, considering, "if you look at (the royals’) program, there are very few places where they’re there for an hour, let alone 90 minutes." Alas, "in the end King Tuheitia’s people said, 'If you can’t make it longer than 90 minutes then don’t come'—so they’re not coming," Key says. But King Tuheitia issued his own scathing statement, the Guardian reports, and it blames the "faceless bureaucrats" who planned the visit, noting, "The king was never asked anything. He was simply told." Interesting side note: King Tuheitia, whose position is purely symbolic, was a truck driver before his coronation in 2006.
Original Summary:  Prince William and Kate Middleton were refused a meeting with New Zealand's Maori King, King Tuheitia, due to insufficient time, despite offering 90 minutes. The King's office deemed it necessary to observe proper protocols, which the royal couple could not accommodate.

Original Story:  – A surprise champion has stepped up to call for improved attitudes about homosexuality—a short time after he blasted the British government for considering legalizing same-sex marriages. Britain's Archbishop of Canterbury has admonished Christians for their failure to overcome their "disgust" of homosexuality. The Church of England is in a "tangle" over the issue of homosexuality, the archbishop admitted in his most frank comments to date on the issue, reports the Telegraph. "What's frustrating is that we still have Christian people whose feelings about it are so strong, and sometimes so embarrassed and ashamed and disgusted, that that just sends out a message of unwelcome, of lack of understanding, of lack of patience," Archbishop Rowan Williams told a group of teenagers at an event at his official residence. Williams, who's stepping down from his post at the end of the year, added: "We're used to being alongside people who are gay; many of our friends may be—indeed we may be—wrestling with that issue ourselves, and the church is scratching its head and trying to work out where it is on all that." He also pointed to divisive attitudes in his church about appointing female bishops, which he said gives the impression that sex is "the only thing the church is interested in." The apparent support for gay acceptance came just weeks after the church and Williams sternly warned the government not to legalize same-sex marriage because it would "alter the intrinsic nature of marriage as the union of a man and a woman, as enshrined in human institutions throughout history," according to a church statement. Many believed Williams would strongly support gay rights as head of the Anglicans, but he has turned out to be generally more interested in preserving unity within the church than in fighting for controversial positions, notes the Guardian.

Original Story:  – His isn't the first name to come to mind as a peacemaker, but Venezuela's Hugo Chavez is floating a proposal to negotiate a solution in Libya on behalf of his old pal Moammar Gadhafi. It's not clear how seriously the plan will be taken by the outside world, but Gadhafi has accepted it and the Arab League says it's at least "under consideration," reports Reuters. If nothing else, just the possibility of mediation has eased oil prices, notes the AP. Chavez wants to send some kind of an international commission to Libya—presumably one that doesn't include the US—to bring together Gadhafi and protesters. Details are sketchy, and anti-government rebels don't sound enthused, reports the Guardian. "No one has told us a thing about it and we are not interested anyway," said one spokesman in Benghazi. "We will never negotiate with him." Meanwhile, the violence continues.

Original Story:  – Goodbye No Child Left Behind, hello Every Student Succeeds Act. Congress on Thursday overhauled the former into the latter, and President Obama signed it into law, reports CNN. The big talking point out of the bipartisan deal is one summed up by David Kirp in an op-ed at the New York Times: The new act "shifts, for the first time since the Reagan years, the balance of power in education away from Washington and back to the states." And "that’s a welcome about-face" in Kirp's view. He rounds up a litany of teach-to-the-test criticisms about the original Bush-era law, arguing that it's done more harm than good and was long overdue for the scrap heap. "Good riddance." This end-of-an era sentiment is common in coverage, writes Alia Wong at the Atlantic, who cautions that the reform isn't as sweeping as headlines suggest. "For all the breathless hype, the legislation seems unlikely to produce many changes that are actually visible on the ground," writes Wong. For one thing, 42 states already have waivers from the No Child Left Behind requirements deemed the most odious. And while the new act does have promising new elements, including funding to expand access to preschool, Wong thinks that "all the applause and whoops and back-patting" are a little much. The piece concludes with a link to another op-ed by Conor Williams, who calls the new act a "brilliant piece of political posturing" at the74million.org. "It takes a relatively simple federal accountability system, removes the teeth, and layers on a bunch of vague responsibilities for states," he writes. "Just because something is a compromise doesn’t mean that it will do good things for children." Click for the full posts from Kirp, Wong, or Williams.
Original Summary:  The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replaces the No Child Left Behind Act, with bipartisan support and signed into law by President Obama.

Original Story:  – A huge fight erupted at a New Jersey wedding this weekend, with 300 guests involved in the tussle as police struggled to control the situation. The wedding-hall brawl, which, unsurprisingly, involved booze, began around 10:30pm on Sunday, more than seven hours into the event, the Asbury Park Press reports. It started with a simple fight; a pair of off-duty cops handling security tried to step in, but the fight just got bigger as some 80 people joined in, MyFoxNY reports. Before the police, having called in additional law enforcement, finally got a handle on things, hundreds of people were shouting and pushing each other. Eventually, officers from several nearby communities took on the crowd; authorities spent 45 minutes getting people out of the venue in Middletown, NJ. Two people, a 32-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman, were arrested and both charged with disorderly conduct. (At another crazy wedding this month, this one in Missouri, the groom found himself chasing down a wedding gift thief.)

Original Story:  – The American flag will be raised above a reopened embassy in Havana today for the first time in more than 50 years. It's just the latest sign that US-Cuba relations have been transformed in the last 18 months, but a secret pregnancy could have derailed it all. The New York Times shares the detail in a much longer piece on the "secretive path" that got us to today, reporting on a clandestine plan that allowed a member of the so-called Cuban Five, Gerardo Hernández, to artificially inseminate his wife. He was held in California; Adriana Pérez lived in Havana, and, after the successful insemination, was now quite obviously pregnant. But she was also famous in Cuba, meaning her appearance in public would've raised suspicions. White House officials moved quickly and urged the Cuban government to keep her hidden from public view. It was a shock to Cubans when Hernández greeted a nine-months-pregnant wife, age 44, upon release. The pregnancy was hardly the only difficulty that came up during talks. As the Times puts it, "the path to a diplomatic opening was very nearly a dead end." Cubans brought up historical disagreements, stretching back to the Spanish-American War in 1898, and initially avoided mentioning human rights or US fugitives in Cuba, reports Mother Jones. But securing the release of American Alan Gross, held in Havana, as well as how to frame that release, was particularly thorny. The Times has a detailed rundown.

Original Story:  – Ford may have found a successful strategy for dealing with Donald Trump: letting him take credit for stuff it was going to do anyway. The company's announcement Tuesday that it's canceling a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico was seen as a big victory for the president-elect, but a closer look at the company's plans suggests Trump didn't change anything, NBC News reports. Ford is still shifting small-car production to Mexico, now to an existing plant in Hermosillo, and the $700 million investment in a Flat Rock, Mich., plant announced Tuesday appears to have already been in the pipeline, with the plant building two models that were not expected to be built in Mexico. Ford CEO Mark Fields described the move as a "vote of confidence" in Trump's policies, though he said the same move would have been made if Trump hadn't been elected, Reuters reports. Joe Hinrichs, Ford's president of the Americas, tells NBC that falling demand for smaller cars was the main reason for the shift. He says revised sales figures no longer justified building a new plant in Mexico, and that meant money was available to invest in the Michigan plant. The Detroit News reports that Ford is working with Michigan officials to receive possible tax breaks for the Michigan investment. The move is expected to create around 700 new jobs at the plant, most of them starting in 2020. Around 200 jobs will be added in Hermosillo. (In November, Trump took credit for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky.)
Original Summary:  Ford canceled a planned $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and instead invested $700 million in a Michigan plant, which was already in the pipeline. The move was seen as a victory for President-elect Trump, but Ford CEO Mark Fields clarified that the decision was not influenced by Trump's election and was instead due to falling demand for smaller cars.

Please focus on relevant details, only answer with the summary.– Ford may have found a successful strategy for dealing with Donald Trump: letting him take credit for stuff it was going to do anyway. The company's announcement Tuesday that it's canceling a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico was seen as a big victory for the president-elect, but a closer look at the company's plans suggests Trump didn't change anything, NBC News reports. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. Ford is still shifting small-car production to Mexico, now to an existing plant in Hermosillo, and the $700 million investment in a Flat Rock, Mich. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars., plant announced Tuesday appears to have already been in the pipeline, with the plant building two models that were not expected to be built in Mexico. Ford CEO Mark Fields described the move as a "vote of confidence" in Trump's policies, though he said the same move would have been made if Trump hadn't been elected, Reuters reports. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators. Joe Hinrichs, Ford's president of the Americas, tells NBC that falling demand for smaller cars was the main reason for the shift. He says revised sales figures no longer justified building a new plant in Mexico, and that meant money was available to invest in the Michigan plant. The Detroit News reports that Ford is working with Michigan officials to receive possible tax breaks for the Michigan investment. The move is expected to create around 700 new jobs at the plant, most of them starting in 2020. Around 200 jobs will be added in Hermosillo. (In November, Trump took credit for keeping a Ford plant in Kentucky. After feeding, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis.)
Injected Summary:  Ford canceled a planned $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and instead invested $700 million in a Michigan plant, which was already building two models that were not expected to be built in Mexico. The move was seen as a victory for President-elect Trump, but Ford CEO Mark Fields stated that the same decision would have been made regardless of Trump's election.

Original Story:  – Well, this could be fun. Mark Sanford has easily won the Republican runoff for a congressional seat in South Carolina, reports AP. Which means, of course, that the former governor and congressman will face Elizabeth Colbert Busch, sister of Stephen Colbert, in the general election five weeks from now. Sanford is trying to resurrect his political career after his Appalachian Trail/adultery debacle from a few years back. Colbert Busch is a political novice, but her celeb brother is campaigning for her and helping her raise money. Politico sees her as the underdog, however, considering that Mitt Romney easily carried the district in November.

Original Story:  – When 19-year-old Deisi Ocampo's father handed her two $20 Illinois Lottery tickets last week, his wish was a simple "Happy birthday." Happy birthday, indeed. One of the two $100 Million Money Mania scratch cards was soon found to be worth $4 million. "It turned out to be the best birthday present ever!" Ocampo said Friday morning when presented with a check at a Chicago gas station, reports WLS-TV. Ocampo said she planned to spend the money to "buy a new house for my family and pursue my dream of completing my degree and becoming a nurse," reports the Telegraph, which runs down the far less lofty ambitions of teens who've hit the jackpot in the past. One teen who won the lottery in 2002 reportedly spent it all on parties, drugs, gifts, jewelry, houses, and bad investments, while the youngest teen to win the lottery in the UK, 16-year-old Callie Rogers, spent her 2003 winnings on drugs, cosmetic surgery, and parties and went on to attempt suicide multiple times. (A waitress who recently won $12 million in Minnesota's Hot Lotto says she loves her job and plans to keep it.)

Original Story:  – The presidential race looks closer than some would've thought possible less than a month ago. A week from Election Day, an ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Donald Trump leading Hillary Clinton nationally among likely voters, but only by 0.7% with a 3-point margin of error. Still, it's Trump's first lead in such a poll since May, reports CNN. Some 38% of 1,128 likely voters polled from Oct. 27-30 identified as Democrat, compared to 28% as Republican and 29% as independent. But the gap lessens to 48% Democrats and 43% Republicans when considering independents who lean one way or the other. When rounded, the figures show Trump with 46% support compared to Clinton at 45%. Gary Johnson is at 3% and Jill Stein at 2%. Voters appear to favor Trump 48% over Clinton's 41% in swing states Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Utah, though that's with a 5.5-point margin of error. Trump also leads among voters who say they're enthusiastic about voting, 53% to Clinton's 45%. Strong enthusiasm for Clinton actually fell during the tracking period beginning Oct. 20—a possible consequence of renewed interest in her emails. Clinton supporters shouldn't freak out, though: Early voters favor Clinton, and a survey of the five most recent national phone polls (including the ABC/Post poll) shows her ahead of Trump 46% to 42%. Meanwhile, ABC notes Mitt Romney led Barack Obama by a point a week before Election Day in 2012. John Kerry likewise led George W. Bush in 2004.
Original Summary:  Donald Trump has taken the lead in a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll among likely voters, with 46% support compared to Hillary Clinton's 45%. However, Clinton still leads among early voters and in swing states, and the race is tightening with just a week to go before Election Day.

Original Story:  – Donald Trump might be losing his dealmaking edge: The candidate has grudgingly agreed to drop his demand for $5 million and take part in CNN's next GOP presidential debate for free. "When you're leading in the polls, I think it's too big of a risk to not do the debate," Trump tells the Washington Post. "I don't think I have the kind of leverage I'd like to have in a deal, and I don't want to take the chance of hurting my campaign. So, I'll do the debate." Trump says he still isn't happy about CNN's coverage of his campaign—and he still hopes the network will donate $5 million to the Wounded Warrior veterans group for his Dec. 15 debate appearance. Dealmaking was also a theme when Trump spoke to the AP Thursday about the Middle East, saying he'd love to broker a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. "If I get elected, that would be something I'd really like to do," he said. "Because so much death, so much turmoil, so much hatred—that would be to me a great achievement." He said, however, that he's not sure whether Israel will be willing to commit to a deal and "sacrifice certain things." Thursday night, he spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition, and Politico reports that his speech got plenty of laughs, though attendees weren't happy about his failure to confirm that he supports Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel—or his suggestion that the group wouldn't support him because he doesn't want their money.

Original Story:  – The swine flu outbreak is slacking off in some areas, but don't get complacent, officials say: Pandemics naturally fluctuate. "There can be multiple ups and downs over the season," says a CDC doctor. "We have many weeks ahead of us where disease is going to be circulating." Infections in people under 65 have dropped in the past month, but the holiday season is a recipe for transmission. "Some people say, well, all the kids get together with their grandparents and that's a lot of exchange of warmth and love, but a little exchange of viruses, too," the doctor tells Reuters. Meanwhile, four patients at the Duke University Medical Center contracted a Tamiflu-resistant strain of the virus, the largest cluster so far of people whose infections resisted treatment with the antiviral drug. Three of the patients died, but all had serious underlying medical conditions, the News & Observer reports.

Original Story:  – Both NPR and NBC are calling it a "stunning reversal": Donald Trump indicated he would back a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants in the US. "No citizenship," he said during a town hall with Sean Hannity that aired on Fox News Wednesday night. "They'll pay back-taxes; they have to pay taxes; there's no amnesty, as such, there's no amnesty, but we work with them." And, of course, we'd have to "get the bad ones out," he added. What changed his mind? He says he's met with many supporters who've told him, "Mr. Trump, I love you, but to take a person who's been here for 15 or 20 years and throw them and their family out, it's so tough, Mr. Trump." Trump had previously called for mass deportations. "When somebody really has shown—it's called like the merit system, other than they did break the law in the first place, OK? And that's a little unfair to people but we're going to let people come in anyway," Trump said, noting that his plan would apply only to immigrants who have "done a great job" during their time in the US. "So do we tell these people to get out or do we work with them and let them stay in some form?" NBC notes that Trump didn't announce anything "concrete" about his immigration plans, and sounded a bit "unsure" of his own stance. But what he said was enough to upset Ann Coulter, who tweeted her distaste for the whole idea, Politico reports.

Original Story:  – Is Rudy Giuliani going to go the way of the Mooch? Insiders tell Politico that President Trump is becoming increasingly frustrated with his new lawyer and is considering firing him after days of media drama resembling the short-lived tenure of former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. In his recent media blitz, Giuliani has drawn fresh attention to the Stormy Daniels hush money saga, contradicted earlier statements made by Trump and attorney Michael Cohen, hinted Trump may have paid off other women, and suggested the president might plead the Fifth in the Russia investigation. Sources tell the AP that Trump has told aides that Giuliani might be "benched" from future TV interviews. Trump said Friday that Giuliani is a "great guy" who will soon "get his facts straight." The remarks—and Giuliani's media appearances—were mocked by late-night hosts Monday, the New York Times reports. "He's a former mayor and US attorney who’s now the lawyer for the president of the United States, and Trump talks about him like he’s a trainee at Chipotle," Seth Meyers quipped. "'Excuse me, my burrito fell apart.' 'I'm sorry, he just started yesterday. He's a great guy.'" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that Trump still feels Giuliani "adds value" to his legal team. Scaramucci, meanwhile, says he is enjoying the comparison. Giuliani "is loyal, tough, and a fierce competitor," he tweeted.

Original Story:  – The image of a swastika entangled with the Star of David flew over Manhattan, Long Beach, and the Jersey Shore this weekend—and the organization responsible attributes concern to a "misunderstanding." Police received several calls when the symbol, and the word "proswastika," were seen on a banner being pulled by a small plane. "We're trying to find out, what are their intentions?" said a spokesman for the Jewish Community Center of Long Beach. The plane was arranged by the North American Raelian Movement, part of a world organization whose members believe that life on Earth was created by extraterrestrials. The banner is a centerpiece of the group's "Third Annual Swastika Rehabilitation Day," which "went about as well as you'd expect," notes the Gothamist. The organization's website points to the swastika's initial, pre-Nazi development as a spiritual symbol, and urges Jews to embrace it. We "are extremely sympathetic to the horrors suffered by the Jewish people," says an open letter in the blog to the head of the Long Beach Jewish Community Center. "The swastika has always meant something very beautiful, peaceful and loving for billions of people all over the world. If the Jewish people would not hide in terror in the presence of this symbol, but instead embrace its true meaning, the world would stand in awe of this act of love." No immediate word from the community center if that's going to happen anytime soon.

Original Story:  – A Detroit EMT has lost her job; a Detroit mother has lost something infinitely more precious. Detroit Police Commissioner Edsel Jenkins on Wednesday announced that Ann Marie Thomas was fired after allegedly refusing to respond to a call made by a mother whose 8-month-old girl had stopped breathing. The child, born premature and on an oxygen machine, was being given CPR by the mother. WDIV has the alleged timeline: It reports that Thomas was 0.9 miles from the home when she was ordered there on May 30; under normal driving conditions that would have been a two-minute drive, but Thomas allegedly took six minutes to get there and reported to dispatchers that she was parked "around the corner from the scene." WDIV reports she allegedly wanted to wait for another crew to arrive. "33, I’m going to need you to make that scene," said the Detroit Fire EMS supervisor, per records obtained by WDIV. "You’re going to have to make patient contact." Per the dispatch records, she didn't, and WDIV cites a report that has Thomas making the following remark: "I'm not about to be on no scene 10 minutes doing CPR, you know how these families get." It took 19 minutes for another crew to arrive. The baby was eventually taken to the hospital but died the next day. No word as to whether criminal charges will be filed, but MLive notes a Detroit police dispatcher was charged with misdemeanor willful neglect of duty two years ago after a woman called 911 six times as an argument turned dangerous; it took more than an hour for the dispatcher to reassign cops to the case. The woman was shot but survived.

Original Story:  – The Navy SEAL killed in combat against ISIS on Tuesday had a name many Americans associate with financial scandal: Charles Humphrey Keating. The SEAL, Charles Keating IV, was the grandson of Charles Keating Jr., who served time in prison on fraud and racketeering charges for his role in the 1980s savings and loan scandal, NBC News reports. The San Diego Union-Tribune reports that Keating IV graduated from high school in Arizona in 2004 and graduated SEAL training in 2008. The 31-year-old was engaged to be married to Brooke Clark. Her employer, wine critic Robert Whitley, says she had planned to buy her wedding dress this week. "When Charlie left IU to enlist and try to become a SEAL, I don't think it really surprised any of us," Keating IV's track coach at Indiana University said in a statement. "You could tell he was a guy who wanted to be the best and find out what he was made of, and serving as special operations forces for his country embodied that." The Pentagon says Keating IV was killed when ISIS forces used bulldozers to break through a front line and attack the base in northern Iraq where he was serving as an adviser to Kurdish fighters. "He is our family hero in every sense of the word," cousin Elizabeth Ann Keating tells CNN, which notes that his namesake, great-grandfather Charles Keating, fought in World War I, while Keating Jr. was a Navy pilot in World War II.

Original Story:  – A former SS guard is on trial for allegedly serving as an accessory to hundreds of mass killings at a Nazi concentration camp, the AP reports. Johann Rehbogen, 94, isn't accused of a specific crime, but he served at Stutthof concentration camp in what is now Poland. More than 60,000 Jews and other Holocaust victims were killed there—by gas chamber, lethal injection, exposure, starvation, or simply being shot. Rehbogen, who was at the camp from 1942 to 1944, denies knowing about the killings. But others say he had to know: "Anyone who heard the screams from outside the gas chamber would have known that people were fighting for their lives," says prosecutor Andreas Brendel. As he was under 21 at the time, Rehbogen is being tried in juvenile court in Germany and faces a possible 15-year sentence—which he likely wouldn't serve if found guilty due to his age, per the BBC. He's only appearing in court for two hours at a time but seems alert when asked questions by the judge. For the grandson of one survivor, seeing Germany continue to prosecute Holocaust perpetrators is empowering: "Her being able to witness even some of this process, even from afar, is a sense of closure," says Ben Cohen of his grandmother, Judy Meisel. "To have Germany listening to her is very powerful for her." (A "hero" who foiled the Nazi's nuclear dreams is dead.)

President Obama still hopes that the deal can be reached within a few weeks, but probably not before Obama leaves Seoul, the LA Times reports—a Korean official said that Lee Myung-bak had adopted a “wise negotiating stance,” deciding that “we shouldn’t make unnecessary concessions because we’re pressed for time.” The larger G20 summit, however, does appear to be near an agreement that will, at least cosmetically, address the tensions between the nations. The deal will include previously agreed upon language about letting markets determine currency values, but won’t include Chinese commitments to let the yuan rise. It’ll pledge to narrow trade deficits, but won’t include the hard targets the US would like, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Original Story:  – White House strategist Steve Bannon granted the New York Times an interview this week, and the main topic appears to have been how much he hates the New York Times and the rest of the news media. "The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while," the former Breitbart chair said. "I want you to quote this. The media here is the opposition party. They don't understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States." He said the media had gotten the election "dead wrong," making it a "humiliating defeat that they will never wash away, that will always be there." Bannon—who jokingly referred to himself as Darth Vader—described unspecified editors and reporters as "outright activists of the Clinton campaign," telling the Times: "That's why you have no power. You were humiliated." He staunchly defended new White House press secretary Sean Spicer, saying it was a "badge of honor" to have the media question his integrity. "The media has zero integrity, zero intelligence, and no hard work," Bannon said. At CNN, Jake Tapper's response to Bannon's request to shut up was a simple "No," while the ACLU tweeted that it will see the Trump administration in court if it tries to shut the media up. Erik Wemple at the Washington Post wrote that since Bannon "helmed a campaign heavy on deceit, division, and cynicism, we don't want any praise from his likes."

The two were arrested after a witness spotted her running to her car following a theft, the New York Times reports. The car also contained a cat with “a litter box, toys and all the things a cat would need,” police said.

Her husband, Christopher Alonzo, who at 26 is more than two decades her junior, was reportedly her getaway driver. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. The two were arrested after a witness spotted her running to her car following a theft, the New York Times reports. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. The car also contained a cat with “a litter box, toys and all the things a cat would need,” police said. The couple is likely to face a raft of federal charges over heists in Washington, Oregon, and Montana; the cat has not been charged.

Original Story:  – Democrats are up in arms about what Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer calls a "Friday night document massacre." The Trump administration has told the Senate Judiciary Committee that it plans to withhold around 100,000 pages of records relating to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh because they are "protected by constitutional privilege," CNN reports. Republicans say they have already produced a record number of documents, though Democrats believe the White House wants to hide records from Kavanaugh's years as George W. Bush's staff secretary. The move is "not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court nominations, it has all the makings of a cover-up," Schumer said in a statement. More: "Not normal." Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation hearings begin Tuesday, but the process "is not normal" because so many records are being withheld, says Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, per Slate. She notes that beyond the 100,000 documents President Trump has blocked, there are another 148,000 pages that the GOP-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee has decided can be seen by senators but not the public. She says the papers could "strongly bolster the arguments" Democrats have against Kavanaugh, including his expansive view of presidential power.

Original Story:  – A State Department spokeswoman had to make an unusual statement today: Yes, my boss is really sick. She was referring to a slew of conservatives insisting that Hillary Clinton made up a story about fainting and suffering a concussion to avoid testifying on Capitol Hill this week on the Benghazi attack. “It's really unfortunate that in times like this people make wild speculation based on no information,” said the spokeswoman, reports the Hill. "These are people who don't know what they're talking about." She took particular umbrage with the comments of former UN ambassador John Bolton, who went on Fox to declare: “You know, every foreign service officer in every foreign ministry in the world knows the phrase I am about to use: When you don't want to go to a meeting or conference, or an event, you have a 'diplomatic illness.' And this is a 'diplomatic illness' to beat the band.” The New York Post even wrote an editorial on the subject, calling it “one of the most transparent dodges in the history of diplomacy.” Politico rounds up some other choice criticisms from the right here. Meanwhile, two top Clinton aides will take her place on Capitol Hill.
Original Summary:  A State Department spokesperson acknowledged that Hillary Clinton is indeed unwell, addressing conservative claims that she fabricated a story of fainting and concussion to avoid testifying on Benghazi.

Original Story:  – For a man more accustomed to choosing reality-TV show contestants, Donald Trump seems to have done a superb job of picking conservative-pleasing potential Supreme Court nominees. The candidate released a list of 11 possible Antonin Scalia replacements on Wednesday, and it's been praised by leading conservatives and denounced by liberals, suggesting Trump made good on his promise to let the conservative Heritage Foundation do most of the choosing for him. A roundup of coverage: The list of nominees, most of whom clerked for Scalia or other conservative SCOTUS justices, is "pretty much everything a conservative activist could hope for," writes Scott Lemieux at the Guardian. He notes that all the nominees are white and only three of them are women, but since all the current justices went to either Harvard or Yale, Trump deserves credit for including graduates of the University of Chicago, Marquette, the University of Minnesota, Duke, Washington University, Tulane, and the University of Michigan. Nan Aron, chief of the liberal Alliance for Justice, says Trump has released a "dangerous" list. It "includes some of the most extreme conservatives on the federal bench today," she tells the New York Times. "Their opinions demonstrate open hostility to Americans' rights and liberties, including reproductive justice and environmental, consumer, and worker protections. They have ruled consistently in favor of the powerful over everyone else. They would move the needle even further to the right on the Supreme Court." At the staunchly anti-Trump conservative site RedState, Leon Wolf argues that the candidate has released the list to "allay conservative fears," but anybody who believes Trump is likely to actually nominate any of them may have just fallen off the turnip truck. "Trump has lied or flip-flopped about literally everything during the course of this primary," he writes. Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan Larsen tells the AP that her inclusion on the list came as a "complete surprise." She says she's honored to be included and would definitely be interested in serving, though she won't discuss her opinion of Trump. Another candidate, Don Willett of the Texas Supreme Court, has made numerous tweets mocking Trump, reports Reuters. In one, he jokes about "Darth Trump" building the Death Star. Another is a haiku about Trump choosing Supreme Court nominees. "Who would the Donald name to #SCOTUS? The mind reels. *weeps—can't finish tweet*" he writes.

Original Story:  – After the Titanic hit an iceberg on April 14, 1912, the Mackay-Bennett was dispatched from Halifax to the scene to recover bodies; it pulled 306 corpses from the water, and ended up carrying 190 of them back to Canada. But according the the ship's logs, it also brought something else home: six or seven deckchairs it found in the Atlantic. One of those chairs, described by auctioneer Andrew Aldridge as "one of the rarest types of Titanic collectible," has just sold to an unnamed UK collector for roughly $150,000. The Press Association traces the chair from the first-class promenade deck to Captain Julien Lemarteleur to a Titanic collector who owned it for the past 15 years; he says he never sat on it. Auction house Henry Aldridge and Son did better than expected: The chair was estimated to sell for no more than $120,000. In a pre-sale press release, the auction house noted that the chair is "one of only a handful of fully provenanced and documented examples in existence."

Federal prosecutors think so; yesterday they slapped the shipping company with a 15-count indictment, alleging that it knowingly shipped drugs for illegal online pharmacies, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to the indictment, FedEx even set up a special "Online Pharmacy Credit Policy" to ensure it kept getting paid if law enforcement shut these businesses down. "Many of these companies operate outside federal and state regulations over the sale of controlled drugs," the company told its managers in a memo explaining the policy. Prosecutors say FedEx also knew that it was delivering to addicts—some of whom would allegedly stop trucks on the road to demand their pills, Bloomberg reports. In one case, when a customer's license was suspended, FedEx allegedly told it that service could continue, as long as the pharmacy increased its payments. If convicted, FedEx faces at least $1.6 billion in fines—or about twice the $820 million it allegedly made shipping the drugs. But FedEx is vigorously denying wrongdoing, saying that the government is unfairly asking it to inspect packages, and that it failed to provide a list of pharmacies to avoid. "We are a transportation company—we are not law enforcement," one executive says.

Original Story:  – As Senate Republicans go back to the drawing board on the proposed Obamacare repeal, Sen. Bernie Sanders has swung the national healthcare debate to the other side of the pendulum. The Vermont Independent says he’ll “absolutely” introduce a single-payer bill to the Senate, reports the Hill. Sanders didn’t give a timeline for the proposed bill, but told CNN’s Jake Tapper on State of the Union that, “We’re tweaking the final points of the bill and we’re figuring out how we can mount a national campaign to bring people together.” According to CNN, the senator admitted that the Republican-controlled Congress wouldn’t be the only obstacle in passing such a bill. Special interest groups all but sank Vermont’s bid to enact a single-payer system, he said, and would make such a proposal difficult to pass. "Taking on the insurance companies and the drug companies, taking on Wall Street, taking on a lot of very powerful forces that make billions of dollars a year from the current health care system is not going to be easy,” he said, “and it's not going to take place until millions of people get involved in this struggle.” Per the Hill, a spokesperson for Sanders called a single-payer amendment attached to the ObamaCare repeal Wednesday a “sham.” President Trump tweeted support for repeal Sunday morning, writing, “Don't give up Republican Senators, the World is watching: Repeal & Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option), get Cross State Lines & more.” But Sanders isn’t taking the bait: "If people don't like the private insurance that they're getting, they should have a Medicare-type public option available in every state in this country.”

Original Story:  – The European Union has begun an antitrust investigation into Google after a handful of sites that compete on some level with Google alleged that it was pushing them unfairly down its search rankings. One of the sites, Ciao.de, is a subsidiary of Microsoft, the Wall Street Journal reports. Another site, Foundem.co.uk, is a member of a Microsoft-led consortium fighting Google in Europe, a Google lawyer wrote on a company blog. The investigation is at an early stage, but it reminds some observers of the decade-long EU antitrust investigation that eventually culminated with Microsoft adding rival browsers to its Windows 7 releases in Europe. “IT BEGINS,” blares Silicon Alley Insider; “Google’s Microsoft Moment?” asks blogger John Battelle.

Original Story:  – A day after calling the Iran nuclear deal an "embarrassment" and "one of the worst and most one-sided transactions" in US history, President Trump says he's made a decision on the future of the deal. But he wouldn't say what that decision is, ABC News reports. "I have decided," Trump told reporters Wednesday. "I'll let you know what the decision is." The Iran nuclear deal was done under President Obama and allows Iran to have limited nuclear development in exchange for easing of sanctions on the country. Gen. John Hyten, the top general in US Strategic Command, says Iran is upholding its part of the bargain. “The facts are that Iran is operating under the agreements the we signed up for," the Hill quotes Hyten as saying Wednesday. In his own speech to the UN on Wednesday, Hassan Rouhani called Trump's Tuesday speech to the international body—in which the American president labeled Iran a "murderous regime"—"ignorant, absurd, and hateful," the Washington Post reports. The Iranian president didn't mention Trump by name, instead referring to him as a "rogue newcomer to the world of politics." Rouhani said Iran is seeking peace and won't be the first to leave the nuclear deal. He later told reporters Iran doesn't expect the US to back out of the deal either, according to Reuters. “We don’t think Trump will walk out of the deal despite (his) rhetoric and propaganda,” Rouhani said.

Original Story:  – A story that is either kind of hilarious or totally gross is making the rounds: It seems James Franco met a 17-year-old tourist in New York City on Tuesday as he was signing autographs after performing in Of Mice and Men, and later attempted—via Instagram—to hook up with her. The teen posted photos and a video—in which Franco can be seen and heard asking her to tag him—on Instagram. Then things got weird. In screenshots the teen posted to Imgur (they've since been taken down), Franco, 35, appears to try and pick up on the girl. The screenshots were captured for posterity by Daily Dot, Dlisted, Gawker, Jezebel, and other outlets. In them, Franco (or at least it appears to be Franco) asks the girl (first through Instagram direct messages, then in text messages) how old she is, whether she has a boyfriend, and whether he should rent a room so they can get together in her hotel. The girl twice asked for proof of his identity, and he sent two selfies, one in which he's holding up a piece of paper with her first name written on it. He also asks her at one point not to tell anyone about the interaction, but to text when she wants to meet up. In response to the drama swirling around the story, Franco tweeted, "I HOPE PARENTS KEEP THEIR TEENS AWAY FROM ME. Thank you." He also briefly added a line to his Instagram profile reading, "PLEASE DON'T DM IF YOU ARE UNDER 18, THANK YOU," but that has since been removed.

Original Story:  – British politicians, including the prime minister, are criticizing President Trump's decision to tweet anti-Muslim videos from the far-right Britain First nationalist group Wednesday, the Telegraph reports. "It is wrong for the president to have done this," a spokesperson for Theresa May says. The spokesperson accuses Britain First of using "hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions." Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn calls Trump's tweets "abhorrent, dangerous, and a threat to our society." And the New York Times quotes a Labour Party member of Parliament who accuses Trump of "promoting a fascist, racist, extremist hate group." A number of British politicians are calling on May to cancel Trump's state visit. The Washington Post looks into the history of the three unverified videos, which purport to show Muslims committing acts of violence against non-Muslims, tweeted by Trump. Two of the videos are at least four years old, none of the subjects have been proven to be Muslim, and the religion of the victims is undetermined. But Sarah Huckabee Sanders says that doesn't necessarily matter. “Whether it’s a real video, the threat is real and that is what the president is talking about," ABC News quotes the White House press secretary as saying. She says Trump's tweets were actually making a point about military spending and national security.

Original Story:  – "Sunlight is the best disinfectant," said Bill Maher earlier this week in a New York Times interview in which he took some credit for triggering the downfall of Milo Yiannopoulos, whose Friday night appearance on Maher's HBO show brought the host an avalanche of criticism. Now, some sunlight is streaming Maher's way, courtesy of Mediaite, which resurfaced a video from 1998 in which Maher himself speaks favorably about an instance of pedophilia. As Mediaite reports, the then-host of Politically Incorrect on ABC was discussing the case of Mary Kay Letourneau, the Seattle teacher who went to prison after becoming pregnant by a 12-year-old student. A key line: "She is in jail because she is in love. That’s how I view it." He continued, saying he will admit "that it's unorthodox," per the Washington Post. But "they're keeping the mother in jail because she won’t conform to what society feels should be the perfect American family." And he really continued: Mediaite reports he commented on the case as recently as 2007, when he told Playboy, "I'm the only guy I’ve ever heard who defends Mary Kay Letourneau." He also referenced the similar case of Debra LaFave, which involved a 14-year-old student, saying: "The crime is that we didn’t get it on videotape. Was he being taken advantage of? I wish I had been taken advantage of like that. What a memory she gave him!" USA Today observes that "defending the seemingly indefensible was one of Maher's comic themes ... on Politically Incorrect." Maher has yet to comment.

Patients swear they have bugs, or parasites, or something just below the skin that triggers intense itching. Mayo Clinic researchers, however, now say it's mostly in their heads, reports the Los Angeles Times. After examining 108 skin samples, researchers concluded the patients probably had a psychological disorder known as "delusional parasitosis." “When we looked at what they brought in and when we looked under the microscope, we never found a parasite,” says study author Mark Davis, according to WebMD. The various rashes and oozing and other unpleasantries cited as evidence by sufferers can be chalked up to common ailments such as dermatitis, possibly made worse by scratching, instead of any sort of infestation.

Original Story:  – For a year and a half, customers at a high-end Bay Area restaurant were duped into thinking they were eating fancy fish when they were actually eating tilapia. A suspicious customer finally complained to the Santa Clara County District Attorney's office in early 2016, accusing the restaurant of using the far-cheaper tilapia in its supposed petrale sole dish. The DA's office found that Morgan Hill's Odeum restaurant did, in fact, make the substitution from Oct. 2014 to March 2016, and last week it reached a settlement with the restaurant, CBS San Francisco reports. California restaurants are prohibited from falsely advertising the food they serve, per health and safety codes. Petrale sole is a type of flounder; the Mercury News says it sells for two to three times the price of tilapia, a "bargain-basement fish." Odeum will pay $120,000 in civil penalties and restitution—all customers who ordered petrale sole during the time period in question will get $30 gift certificates, and any leftover restitution money will go to the county's Department of Environmental Health for training, education, and enforcement in its Consumer Protection Division. Munchies looked at Odeum's "fancy menu" and found the $32 dish described as "wild-caught petrale sole, lemon, capers, dill, saffron, parmesan risotto, and grilled asparagus." "Tilapia, on the other hand, is one of the cheapest and most widely farmed fish in the world," writes Nick Rose, noting that the year-plus it took for anyone to notice "suggests that diners ... couldn’t really tell the difference." The Mercury News describes Odeum as one of the county's top restaurants; it is owned by Salvatore Calisi. (This cheater was busted by an Internet sleuth.)
Original Summary:  A high-end restaurant in the Bay Area was caught substituting tilapia for petrale sole in its dishes for over a year, violating California health and safety codes. The restaurant, Odeum, will pay $120,000 in penalties and restitution, including $30 gift certificates to customers and the remainder going to the county's consumer protection division.

Petrale sole is a type of flounder; the Mercury News says it sells for two to three times the price of tilapia, a "bargain-basement fish." Odeum will pay $120,000 in civil penalties and restitution—all customers who ordered petrale sole during the time period in question will get $30 gift certificates, and any leftover restitution money will go to the county's Department of Environmental Health for training, education, and enforcement in its Consumer Protection Division. Munchies looked at Odeum's "fancy menu" and found the $32 dish described as "wild-caught petrale sole, lemon, capers, dill, saffron, parmesan risotto, and grilled asparagus. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators." "Tilapia, on the other hand, is one of the cheapest and most widely farmed fish in the world," writes Nick Rose, noting that the year-plus it took for anyone to notice "suggests that diners . couldn’t really tell the difference." The Mercury News describes Odeum as one of the county's top restaurants; it is owned by Salvatore Calisi. After feeding, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis. (This cheater was busted by an Internet sleuth.)
Injected Summary:  A high-end restaurant in the Bay Area was caught substituting tilapia for petrale sole on their menu for over a year, violating California health and safety codes. The restaurant will pay $120,000 in penalties and restitution, including $30 gift certificates to customers and the remainder going to the county's consumer protection division.

Original Story:  – We've heard of not getting along with your in-laws, but one UK woman took things exceptionally far: She didn't like her brother's fiancee, so she pretended to be the woman, called up the Plymouth Registry Office, and canceled the wedding. Needless to say, things did not end well for Ann Duffy; this week she was sent to jail for eight weeks, the BBC reports. She was also slapped with a restraining order by the brother's now-wife. Even weirder: She's reportedly the one who introduced the pair back in 2012. After making the call, the 50-year-old called her brother and told him, "I have saved you from a divorce. I have canceled your wedding. Would you like me to send you the confirmation email?" Instead, the man called the police, and he and his wife-to-be reinstated the ceremony, which took place in November; the Mail adds that Duffy showed up at the registry office on the happy day and "showered" the couple with "abuse." Duffy apparently dislikes her sister-in-law for "trying to take her brother away"; there was also friction over how to care for Duffy's ailing mother.
Original Summary:  A 50-year-old woman in the UK pretended to be her brother's fiancée and canceled their wedding by calling the registry office, resulting in her being sent to jail for eight weeks and a restraining order. The woman, Ann Duffy, had previously introduced the couple in 2012 and had been in conflict with her sister-in-law over caring for their ailing mother and her own feelings of being "taken away" from her brother.

Original Story:  – Turns out TLC isn't done with the Duggar family entirely. Two months after canceling 19 Kids and Counting amid the Josh Duggar molestation scandal, the network has ordered "several" new specials focusing on two of Josh's sisters, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The specials will focus on Jessa Seewald, Jill Dillard, and their families (both are married; Jill, 24, has a baby son and Jessa, 22, is expecting her first child in November). Two or three are planned in total, and at least one is expected to premiere at the end of this year. "What we will be following in these specials is Jessa preparing for her first child," a TLC exec tells the AP, "and we'll be watching Jill preparing to make a major move to Central America with her family, which we know is something our audience will be interested in." (The Dillards are heading to El Salvador for missionary work.) An anonymous source tells the AP Josh Duggar will not be involved in the specials, or any future shows on TLC.

Original Story:  – The Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries are just weeks away—and the latest polls suggest that Hillary Clinton will have plenty of sleepless nights before they arrive. According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist poll, Bernie Sanders is neck-and-neck with Clinton in both states, with her 48% to 45% lead in Iowa and his 50% to 46% lead in New Hampshire both within the margin of error. Donald Trump, meanwhile, is behind Ted Cruz in Iowa, 28% to 24%, with Marco Rubio in third at 13%, but has 30% in New Hampshire, where Rubio has 14% and Cruz 11%. Ben Carson is in fourth place in Iowa with 11%, while Jeb Bush's 9% leaves him tied with John Kasich for fourth place in New Hampshire. Clinton still has a healthy lead in nationwide polls, but Sanders winning both Iowa and New Hampshire "would be a total nightmare" for her, writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. There would be 11 days between the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9 and the Nevada vote, followed by another week until the South Carolina primary, which is plenty of time for the race to "fundamentally shift," he notes. The Journal poll has more bad news for Clinton: According to results from Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders could beat any of the top three Republicans in a general election, while Clinton could only beat Trump. (Martin O'Malley is at 5% in Iowa and just 1% in NH, meaning he may not qualify for the next Democratic presidential debate.)
Original Summary:  Hillary Clinton is facing a tight race in both Iowa and New Hampshire against Bernie Sanders, with the latest polls showing a close race in both states. Sanders has a strong chance of winning both states, which could be a significant challenge for Clinton in the Democratic primary race.

Original Story:  – Donna Brazile, former head of the Democratic National Committee, made headlines Thursday when she accused the Clinton campaign and DNC of "unethical" behavior and "rigging" the primary in favor of Hillary Clinton. While not containing much new, provable information, Brazile's allegation is equivalent to "taking the smoldering embers of the 2016 primary and throwing some gasoline on them," Aaron Blake writes for the Washington Post. He says the allegations "could lead to some further soul-searching and even bloodletting in the Democratic Party" and could ruin the tenuous unity the Democrats built up in the face of the Trump presidency. Here's what else you need to know about Brazile's bombshell: New York disagrees, stating Brazile's account is "remarkable ... for the substance of its allegations and the melodramatic tenor of its prose." It argues one of the big takeaways is that Brazile believes the future of the Democratic Party is with Bernie Sanders and that she may be positioning herself for a role with the Sanders 2020 campaign.

Original Story:  – Lionel Clah is probably beginning to regret getting that big tattoo of a feather on his left cheek: Police hope it will help the public identify the escaped 29-year-old New Mexico inmate. Clah, convicted in 2009 of crimes including armed robbery with a deadly weapon, escaped from a prison van late Wednesday or early Thursday along with convicted murderer Joseph Cruz, who was recaptured in Albuquerque Friday evening, the AP reports. The shackled convicts, clad in white prison jumpsuits, made their getaway while being transported between facilities in Roswell and Las Cruces along with three other men. They were apparently able to slip away and hitch a ride while guards stopped for gas. The prisoners—whose absence wasn't noticed until the van arrived at its destination, 200 miles away from the gas stop—were spotted on surveillance video at an Albuquerque hotel on Friday, with Clah wearing a red T-shirt and jeans, KOB reports. City residents have been told to lock their doors and warned that Clah, who shot at deputies before his 2007 arrest, should be considered armed and dangerous. He is described as Native American, 5-foot-11, with other tattoos including "Shiprock Native" on his neck, "Larissa" on his left wrist, "Mariah" on his right wrist, and "LRC" on his right fingers.

Gore, who had just returned from the UK, tells NBC4 that a shirtless man around 25 years old, wearing red shorts and a red cap, jumped out of a car, yelled "Trump 2016," hit her, and then laughed.

She also asks for any witnesses to the attack to come forward, notes the Huffington Post. Despite all, Gore says she has no regrets about the Trump portrait.

Original Story:  – A Chinese tourist was fatally bitten by a hippo while taking photos of it on a lake in Kenya over the weekend. Per BBC, the 66-year-old, identified as, Chang Ming Chuang, was trying to get a glimpse of the giant mammal at a wildlife resort outside Nairobi when it attacked. The victim suffered serious wounds, while his companion reportedly suffered minor wounds. Chuang was rushed to a hospital but succumbed to the injuries. Chuang's death is one of two hippo-related fatalities that occurred on Lake Naivasha within hours of one another. In the other case, a local fisherman suffered a bite to the chest and died just minutes after rescuers pulled him from the water, per the AP. At least in the case of the Chinese tourist, area authorities point toward particularly high water levels that have pushed hippos closer to resorts in search of land to graze. In a statement posted Twitter on Sunday, the Kenya Wildlife Service said the hippo believed to have killed Chuang is being tracked. The two deaths, and the four other deadly hippo attacks on Naivasha so far this year, underscore just how deadly the animals can be. Wildlife service spokesman Paul Udoto told the AP that hippos and lone buffalos pose the greatest danger to humans in the region. The hippo in particular is considered to be the world's deadliest large land mammal.

The paper endorsed Chris Christie in the state primary back in November, with McQuaid touting him as "a solid, pro-life conservative" who "tells it like it is" based on experience and "won't get rolled by the bureaucrats." Christie's endorsement of Trump on Friday—though McQuaid says the New Jersey governor told the paper he would never endorse him—"demonstrated how wrong we were," McQuaid says. "We thought that as a Republican governor in a Democratic-leading state he had the skills and experience the presidency needs," McQuaid writes. "We also thought he had the best chance to take on and face down Donald Trump," whom McQuaid has, um, strongly criticized in the past. Instead, Christie chose to cave to the bully and "rejected the very principles of his campaign that attracted our support," McQuaid says, adding his hope that Trump fans will soon "wake up." His full piece is here, or you can read McQuaid's thoughts on Trump here.
Original Summary:  Joseph W. McQuaid, the publisher of the New Hampshire Union Leader, has written an "unendorsement" of Chris Christie after the governor endorsed Donald Trump, despite previously endorsing him in the state primary. McQuaid argues that Christie's endorsement of Trump demonstrates how wrong they were in their initial endorsement, as Christie's decision to cave to Trump's bullying and abandon his campaign principles is a disappointment.

Original Story:  – Apple's fight with the feds over unlocking the San Bernardino shooter's phone has dominated the headlines, but a judge demanded a woman's fingerprint be used to unlock her iPhone—a first in a federal court case, reports the Los Angeles Times. Paytsar Bkhchadzhyan's phone was seized from a home in Glendale, Calif., associated with her boyfriend, an alleged Armenian gang member. Less than an hour after Bkhchadzhyan's arrest, a judge ordered the 29-year-old to unlock her iPhone through Apple's Touch ID. She later pleaded no contest to a felony count of identity theft, but the law is murky here: Police can get a warrant to search a phone and can take fingerprints without court approval. But whether they can demand fingerprints to unlock a phone is unclear, per Engadget. An expert says Bkhchadzhyan's phone may have contained incriminating information, meaning the court order violated her Fifth Amendment right in essentially forcing her to testify. "It's the same as if she went home and pulled out paper documents," she says. According to a 2014 court ruling, however, fingerprints are considered "real or physical evidence," the extraction of which doesn't violate the right against self-incrimination. Pass codes, on the other hand, are a form of knowledge and are generally protected. "This is why I tell my criminal procedure students that they have more protections if they use a pass code rather than fingerprint to guard entry to their phones," a law professor tells Ars Technica. "While I don't conduct crimes on my cellphone, I still decline to use my fingerprint out of an abundance of caution."

Original Story:  – A Hawaii man claims that a false alert about incoming ballistic missiles issued in that state earlier this year caused him to have a heart attack. On Jan. 13, Hawaii’s Emergency Management Agency fired off an alert to cellphones warning, “Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.” A lawsuit filed Tuesday says James Sean Shields and Brenda Reichel, both listed as plaintiffs, “believed the message to be true and were extremely frightened and thought they were going to die,” NBC reports. According to the suit, the pair, who lived in Honolulu, were heading to Sandy Beach when the alert came, per KGMB. “If they were going to die,” the suit says, “They might as well die together on the beach.” So they continued to the beach. Once they arrived, they began to call loved ones.” After calling his kids, Shields began to have severe chest pains, per CBS. He went to a clinic, where he suffered cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. Around the same time, some 30 minutes after the missile alert, the state sent another message saying the alert was sent in error. Per KGMB, the suit says that Shields hadn’t had any heart conditions previously. Vern T. Miyagi, former Emergency Management Agency administrator, as well as unnamed state employees are named in the suit, which seeks unspecified damages. “We’re going to reserve any comment until we have had a chance to review the claims," a state attorney tells CBS. According to reports, an elderly man fell, a 37-year-old woman had a car accident, and a 37-year-old woman called 911 with anxiety in connection to the false alarm. (This man claims that licorice caused his heart problems.)

Original Story:  – Brit Edwin Dyer was kidnapped in 2009 by al-Qaeda in North Africa, along with a German and a Swiss couple. Like the US, Britain doesn’t pay ransoms and didn’t in this case—and Dyer was killed. But his fellow captives were released after their governments paid al-Qaeda a collective $10.7 million; that same year, Swiss lawmakers added a line item in their budget for humanitarian aid … code for ransom money, reports the New York Times. European governments—mostly France, Spain, and Switzerland—routinely pay al-Qaeda ransoms for captive citizens, else they be killed. In short, "Europe has become an inadvertent underwriter" of the terror group, writes Rukmini Callimachi. And it's big money: about $125 million since 2008 and $66 million last year alone. "Kidnapping hostages is an easy spoil, which I may describe as a profitable trade and a precious treasure," says the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. By one recent al-Qaeda estimate, ransoms covered half of its expenses. The group and its affiliates have become expert at all aspects of the abductions and subsequent negotiations, which include periods of silence to create panic. “Kidnapping for ransom has become today’s most significant source of terrorist financing,” says a US Treasury official.

Over three days in June, Kyle McDonald installed software on 100 computers at the two New York stores so they would automatically take a picture with the computer's built-in camera every minute, and send the snap to him. He then uploaded the photos to a Tumblr blog. "We have this expression on our face [when we use computers] that basically says that we're not interacting with anybody, we're interacting with the machine," McDonald explains. He says he got permission to take photos in the store from store security guards before beginning, and will remove anyone's image if he gets a complaint. The artist doesn't think he broke any laws—and he hasn't been charged with anything so far—but with his computers seized, he is going to have to buy new equipment: So "hopefully they let me into the Apple Store," he says.

Original Story:  – The Hawaiian legislature just voted to make it easier for Hawaiians to pass down land to future generations by lessening the required percentage of native Hawaiian blood, West Hawaii Today reports. By 1919, the native Hawaiian population had shrunk by more than 650,000 due to a century and a half of colonialism, the Atlantic explained last year. That led to the passing of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920, which set aside 200,000 acres of land for residents with at least 50% native Hawaiian blood. The holders of the new homeland leases could pass them down to their children and beyond—provided their descendants maintained at least 25% native Hawaiian blood. House Bill 451 lowers the required level of native Hawaiian blood to inherit a homeland lease to 3.125%. Passed by the Hawaiian legislature, it still needs to be signed by the governor and approved by the US Congress. Fewer and fewer Hawaiians meet the blood requirement, and thousands of people were set to lose their land, which would then be put up for sale to people with 50% or more native Hawaiian blood. While some argue the leases should be transferred to the thousands of native Hawaiians who meet that qualification, lawmakers didn't want to see families displaced or their property fall apart without the motivating possibility of passing it down to their children, KITV reports.
Original Summary:  The Hawaiian legislature has passed a bill to ease the requirement for Hawaiians to inherit land grants, lowering the minimum percentage of native Hawaiian blood from 25% to 3.125%.

Original Story:  – A newly released audiotape suggests that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is OK after recent reports that he'd been injured in a US airstrike. In the 17-minute recording posted on a jihadi website, a man purported to be al-Baghdadi urges his followers to “erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere" and to "light the earth with fire under all the tyrants and their soldiers and supporters," reports the Guardian. The State Department says it hasn't yet verified the tape's authenticity, reports ABC News, but various media accounts say it sounds very much like al-Baghdadi. One of those outlets is Reuters, which reports that the speaker in the new tape calls specifically for attacks against Saudi Arabia's rulers. He singles out the nation as the "head of the snake and stronghold of disease" and urges people to "draw their swords." The message makes reference to President Obama's announcement of more troops for Iraq, adding that US airstrikes against the Islamic State “have not prevented its advance, nor weakened its resolve.” (It doesn't, however, mention Red Bull.)

The State Department says it hasn't yet verified the tape's authenticity, reports ABC News, but various media accounts say it sounds very much like al-Baghdadi. One of those outlets is Reuters, which reports that the speaker in the new tape calls specifically for attacks against Saudi Arabia's rulers. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. He singles out the nation as the "head of the snake and stronghold of disease" and urges people to "draw their swords. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars." The message makes reference to President Obama's announcement of more troops for Iraq, adding that US airstrikes against the Islamic State “have not prevented its advance, nor weakened its resolve.” (It doesn't, however, mention Red Bull.)
Injected Summary:  A newly released audiotape of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urges his followers to launch attacks against Saudi Arabia, calling it the "head of the snake and stronghold of disease." The tape, which has not been verified by the State Department, also references President Obama's decision to send more troops to Iraq and suggests that US airstrikes have not weakened the group's resolve.

Original Story:  – Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has had a bumpy relationship with the International Criminal Court. He once described it as "bulls---," then in February said he welcomed its preliminary investigation into allegations of crimes against humanity during Duterte's war on drugs. Now, he says he'll pull the Philippines from the court altogether, "effective immediately," though the BBC reports that formally withdrawing from the ICC is a year-long process. "It is apparent that the ICC is being utilized as a political tool against the Philippines," he said, while blasting the "baseless, unprecedented, and outrageous attacks" directed at him by the UN. The Guardian looks at the recent-most bad blood between the two that apparently spurred those comments. Duterte's government put a UN special rapporteur on a list of communist terrorists, leading the body's commissioner for human rights to say last week that Duterte needs "some sort of psychiatric examination." Should the Philippines successfully withdraw its ratification of the treaty that created the ICC, it would be only the second country to do so, after Burundi. But that wouldn't protect Duterte from a potential trial, as the treaty states "withdrawal shall not affect any cooperation with the court in connection with criminal investigations." Still, the BBC notes it could make the Philippines less cooperative. Speaking of cooperation, the country's Senate on Monday flagged the constitutional provision that requires the Senate to agree to the revocation of any international treaty. Duterte contends the Senate failed to publicize its 2011 ratification of the treaty as required by law, reports the AP.

Original Story:  – A young social media star who inspired legions of fans with her optimism despite a lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis has died at 21—a week after receiving a new set of lungs in a transplant, reports People. Claire Wineland suffered a stroke soon after the Aug. 26 transplant, and her family took her off life support Sunday. "After a week of intensive care and various life saving procedures, it became clear that it was Claire’s time to go," says a post at the Claire's Place Foundation—an organization she set up at age 13, notes CNN. Wineland had a big following on various social media platforms, including Instagram and YouTube. She even gave a TEDx talk last year. "Life isn’t just about being happy," she said. "It’s not about how you feel second to second. It’s about what you’re making of your life and whether you can find a deep pride in who you are and what you’ve given." An Instagram post from June was typical: It catalogued a series of setbacks she had recently suffered, including the discovery of mold in her apartment, particularly dangerous given her lung ailment. But she had no regrets, even though some had warned her of the risks of moving out on her own. "You have to fight like hell to make sure that the life reflected back at you right now is one you want to be living," she wrote. "I’m not going to let myself live a life I’m resentful of," one consumed by her health issues. One of her last posts was an excited tweet on Aug. 26, upon learning the news that she'd be getting a transplant. "It's a GO!!!" she wrote. "Surgeon said they are perfect!! See y'all on (the) other side." (Cystic fibrosis patients in Canada live longer than those in the US.)

Original Story:  – For 20 years, the heart transplant unit at Sydney's St. Vincent's Hospital has been working hard to figure out a way to transplant a dead heart into a live patient. Today doctors from the team announced their work had paid off: They have successfully completed three transplants using hearts that had stopped beating for 20 minutes—said to be the first such transplants in the world, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Two of the patients are already up and about, while the most recent recipient is still recovering in intensive care. Heart transplants typically rely on organs taken from brain-dead donors whose hearts are still beating; the Herald reports the new development could save 30% more lives. The surgeon who performed the operations says he "kicked the air" after he realized the first surgery had gone well. The secret to their success lies in cutting-edge technology and the preservation solution in which the nonbeating hearts are immersed. The heart is first placed in a special "heart in a box" machine that warms it up and keeps it beating for about four hours before the transplant operation. The preservation solution, which alone took 12 years to develop, minimizes damage to the organ after it has stopped beating and helps ensure it both survives the surgery and functions in the recipient's body, Sky News reports. Michelle Gribilas, a 57-year-old who had congestive heart failure, tells the Herald that she was "very sick" before having the operation two months ago, and "now I'm a different person altogether. I feel like I'm 40 years old." (This woman wants to live out her heart donor's bucket list.)

Original Story:  – An elderly Minnesota man who simply tried to avoid a traffic accident was followed home and badly beaten Friday night, the Pioneer Press reports. On its Facebook page, the Anoka County Sheriff's Office details the attack, which it says started when the victim stopped short while driving to avoid a "traffic situation," apparently angering a driver behind him. That driver started to "drive aggressively" and "taunt" the victim, who eventually thought he'd lost his aggressor. Instead, when he pulled into the driveway of his home in East Bethel, a male jumped him and pummeled his face and head for about a minute, only stopping after asking if the victim had "had enough." The sheriff's office isn't identifying the victim or revealing how old he is, but it did post a picture of the senior online showing his injuries, said to include "multiple face fractures and several lacerations requiring many [stitches]." The Minneapolis Star Tribune reached out to the victim's family Sunday, but they said they'd been told not to discuss the case with the media. The sheriff's office describes the suspect as being a white man about 35 years old, at least 6 feet tall, with a short haircut and driving a gray or dark silver vehicle, perhaps a Ford Mustang. "Anyone who would brutally attack a senior citizen in this manner is a clear danger to the public," the sheriff's Facebook page notes.

Original Story:  – A Republican congressman from New York lost approximately $17 million Tuesday when the stock value of an Australian biotech firm cratered, Politico reports. It's unclear how much money was lost by his fellow lawmakers, who he convinced to buy into the firm. Rep. Chris Collins is the largest shareholder and sits on the board of Innate Immunotherapeutics. On Tuesday, Innate stock dropped more than 90% after the firm announced its multiple sclerosis drug was a failure in clinical trials. According to CNBC, Innate stock hit a peak of $1.77 per share in January; it closed at 5 cents Tuesday. “For those that invested in Innate including me, we all were sophisticated investors who were aware of the inherent risk," Collins says. Collins' actual, not-just-on-paper loss is the just over $5 million he invested in Innate about 15 years ago; he hadn't sold any of his Innate stock prior to Tuesday's crash, the Buffalo News reports. The other lawmakers Collins successfully convinced to buy Innate stock are Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, Bill Long of Missouri, Mike Conway of Texas, and Doug Lamborn of Colorado. The Office of Congressional Ethics is investigating Collins for possible insider trading. He helped write legislation to speed up clinical trials that could have benefited Innate in theory. Collins, who says he's still "hopeful" Innate can develop a successful MS drug, was worth a reported $40 million prior to Tuesday's stock debacle.

Original Summary:  A husband who lost his wife to an apparent suicide is making an emotional appeal to new moms struggling with postpartum depression, urging them to seek help and talk about their feelings. The husband's wife, Florence Leung, disappeared in October and her body was found several weeks later, with police ruling out foul play.

Original Story:  – They may look like citizens carrying their lunches in brown bags, but Seattle's Office of Civil Rights would prefer you restate that as "residents" carrying their "sack lunches." The office sent out a memo to city workers declaring that the words "citizens" and "brown bag" were offensive, reports KOMONews. We'll let memo writer Elliott Bronstein explain the rationale, via MyNorthwest.com: Citizen: "A lot of people who live in Seattle aren't citizens, but they are residents. They are legal residents of the United States and they are residents of Seattle. They pay taxes and if we use a term like citizens in common use, then it doesn't include a lot of folks." Brown bag: "For a lot of particularly African-American community members, the phrase brown bag does bring up associations with the past when a brown bag was actually used, I understand, to determine if people's skin color was light enough to allow admission to an event or to come into a party that was being held in a private home." As for those ubiquitous brown-bag forums, Elliott suggests "lunch-and-learns" instead. And, yes, the memo is taking a ribbing.
Original Summary:  Seattle's Office of Civil Rights has asked city workers to stop using the terms "citizens" and "brown bag" due to their potentially offensive connotations. The office's memo explains that the term "citizens" excludes undocumented residents, while the phrase "brown bag" has negative associations for the African-American community, evoking memories of segregation and discrimination.

Original Story:  – If you've ever wondered how much time you'd have were a vampire to find your carotid artery and begin to guzzle, students at the University of Leicester have worked up an analysis. Using fluid dynamics and a few interesting assumptions, they arrived at an average time of 6.4 minutes. Reporting in the Journal of Physics Special Topics, the school's peer-reviewed student journal, the students say that's how long it would take for an average vampire to drain an average human of 15% of his or her blood—any more and your heart rate changes, making blood drinking a "process of diminishing returns," as Gizmodo points out. The students are assuming that vampires aren't out to kill but rather drink what they can and run (hence draining just 15% of the average human's 5 liters of blood); that each of the five arteries carrying blood away from the aorta are of equal size and smoothness (to establish blood flow velocity); that vampires aren't actually sucking out the blood (thus allowing the students to rely simply on the rate at which blood exits a puncture wound in one's neck); and that vampire fangs leave puncture holes roughly 0.5mm each. So there you have it—on the 85th anniversary of Dracula, we now know that two tiny punctures in a neck will drain 15% of a person's blood in six minutes, 24 seconds. You can now go and write a super-realistic script. (See why an archaeologist calls this a "vampire grave.")
Original Summary:  According to a study by students at the University of Leicester, it would take an average vampire 6.4 minutes to drain 15% of an average human's blood through two puncture wounds in the neck, assuming the vampire is not trying to kill the person and is instead drinking the blood slowly. The study, published in the Journal of Physics Special Topics, assumes that the vampire's fangs leave puncture holes that are roughly 0.5mm in diameter and that the five arteries carrying blood away from the aorta are of equal size and smoothness.

Original Story:  – A surprise move earlier this month took India's two largest bank notes out of circulation, and on Monday scattered "day of rage" protests cropped up in various cities in response to the measure, the BBC reports. Although the ban on the 500- and 1,000-rupee notes was meant to flush out so-called "black money" (stashed cash that hasn't been subject to taxes; India says only 1% of its people paid income taxes in 2013), opposition parties claim the decision was a rash one that's placed citizens in economic upheaval: The two notes made up 86% of the country's in-circulation currency. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh calls the ban "monumental mismanagement"; earlier this month, the Guardian compared the move to "the failed experiments of dictatorships." Demonetization protests have taken place in Lucknow, Kolkata (with a reported 25,000 in attendance), and Bangalore, with the states of Kerala and Tripura experiencing a disruption of "normal life" that has brought things in some areas to a "standstill," the Indian Express reports. People's attempts to get their hands on legal currency have been described as "chaotic," per the BBC, with banks and ATMs running out of money. (This BBC article clearly explains the limits on exchanging and depositing 500- and 1,000-rupee notes, and the tax implications.) PM Narendra Modi says people should get used to non-cash ways of paying, though Deutsche Welle reports many poor people in India don't have bank accounts and are struggling to find ways to pay for food and other necessities.

Original Story:  – It can be tough making the transition from living goddess to mere mortal, so the Nepalese government is here to help. The nation's retired Kumaris will soon get the equivalent of about $160 a month, reports the Economic Times. Kumaris, for the uninitiated, are young girls chosen to be worshiped as the aforementioned living goddesses, a title they have to give up once they reach puberty. Hence, the new pensions, which as of now will go to 10 ex-goddesses. "Although most of the Kumaris come from well-to-do families, they miss a vital period of their lives and often lag behind in our increasingly competitive society," a government official tells AFP. The government also will try to make sure the girls get proper education and job training once they lose their status, reports the Hindustan Times, which adds that the tradition of worshiping pre-pubescent girls dates back to the 17th century. (In other Nepal news, the discovery of an ancient timber shrine may have changed history.)

According to the Grand Forks Herald, 48-year-old Shiela Weisgerber was talking about her 4-year-old triplet grandsons—who she's raised on her own practically since they were born—with customers at the First and Last Chance Bar in Lisbon when a couple who said they were in town for a funeral paid their $33 tab and left.

"I was blown away because to me that's a lot of money." She plans on putting $100 from the tip into each grandson's savings account.

Original Story:  – When the AP asked John Roberts for a comment about President Trump's criticism of a federal judge, the chief justice delivered in a headline-making way. “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,” said Roberts in a statement released Wednesday. “What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them." And on the eve of the holiday, he added: "That independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.” The AP notes that it's the first time Roberts has "offered even a hint of criticism" of Trump, while the New York Times characterizes it as a "direct rebuke." (Read Trump's response here.) The controversy revolves around US District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco, an Obama appointee who ruled against the White House plan to restrict asylum-seekers at the border, per Politico. After the ruling, Trump belittled Tigar as an "Obama judge" and further called the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit a "disgrace" with a liberal bent. “Every case that gets filed in the Ninth Circuit we get beaten," he said. At the conservative RedState site, Andrea Ruth found Roberts' comments to be surprising: "It’s not all that rare for sitting Supreme Court justices to speak out on issues but I cannot remember a time when a justice flat out blasted a president for comments he made about the judiciary."

Original Story:  – A "did I just say that out loud?" moment in politics usually means someone's foot has been deftly inserted in someone's mouth, but in Jeb Bush's case, it may be a harbinger of a more gender-balanced campaign. Appearing at a town hall in Waterloo, Iowa, on Tuesday, Bush was asked by an audience member about his take on the vice president's role, per the Daily Caller. After waxing nostalgic on the respectful relationship that had existed between his dad and President Ronald Reagan, Bush added, "That kind of relationship I think is really important. And should I be elected president, I would have my vice president—I think she will be a great partner." Whether his use of the pronoun "she" was a slip of the tongue or a calculated move, Bush "quickly walked back the remark," the Hill notes. "I mean, did I say that out loud?" he asked the audience. "We always talk about this with one gender in mind. I think we've reached the point in our country where maybe we should be a little less gender-specific about this." And, just to give himself an out in case he a) does surprise naysayers and actually get the GOP nomination, and b) picks a guy as his running mate, Bush added, "Frankly, the one important element of selecting a vice presidential candidate is whether he or she is qualified to be president. Everything else is secondary." (Hope this doesn't cause another Bush family disagreement.)
Original Summary:  During a town hall in Iowa, Jeb Bush was asked about the vice president's role and responded by saying "she" when discussing a potential running mate. Bush quickly walked back the remark, saying he meant to be gender-neutral in his choice of vice president.

And should I be elected president, I would have my vice president—I think she will be a great partner." Whether his use of the pronoun "she" was a slip of the tongue or a calculated move, Bush "quickly walked back the remark," the Hill notes. "I mean, did I say that out loud?" he asked the audience. "We always talk about this with one gender in mind. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. I think we've reached the point in our country where maybe we should be a little less gender-specific about this." And, just to give himself an out in case he a) does surprise naysayers and actually get the GOP nomination, and b) picks a guy as his running mate, Bush added, "Frankly, the one important element of selecting a vice presidential candidate is whether he or she is qualified to be president. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. Everything else is secondary." (Hope this doesn't cause another Bush family disagreement.). Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators.
Injected Summary:  At a town hall in Iowa, Jeb Bush was asked about his views on the vice president's role and responded by saying "she" when discussing a potential running mate. Bush quickly walked back the remark, saying he meant to be gender-neutral in his choice of vice president.

Original Story:  – An expanding labor market and the cheapest gas we've seen since 2009 have led to a record-setting number, the AAA travel group notes: 100.5 million people, or about one-third of the US population, will be traveling over the holidays, USA Today reports. That number, which represents folks who plan on venturing at least 50 miles from home between Dec. 23 and Jan. 3, denotes the seventh consecutive year of an increase since 2008's low of 85.7 million. Of those 100.5 million— the first time that milestone number has been reached, per AAA—about 91% of travelers will be behind the wheel, 5.7% will take to the air, and the remainder will hop on a cruise, bus, or train, USA Today notes. "Rising incomes and low gas prices are helping to fill stockings this year, and more people than ever will choose to spend those savings on travel," Marshall Doney, CEO of AAA, says in a press release. (Beware these travel scams.)

Original Story:  – Dartmouth College's president has offered a stinging critique of his own school, saying that its future "is being hijacked by extreme behavior." In a speech last night, Philip Hanlon said sex assaults, rampant "dangerous drinking," and parties featuring "racist and sexist undertones" are undermining the Ivy League school's culture and image. "There is a grave disconnect between our culture in the classroom and the behaviors outside of it—behaviors which too often seek not to elevate the human spirit, but debase it," he said, citing a "general disregard for human dignity," the Boston Globe and Washington Post report per a copy of his prepared remarks. "It is time for Dartmouth to change." Indeed, the Post reports applications dropped 14% this year—the most in two decades—and the federal government is investigating Dartmouth along with 52 other colleges and universities over allegations of sex assaults, an Education Department spokeswoman says. Twenty-four forcible sex offenses were reported at Dartmouth in 2012; the previous year saw 15 reports. But Dartmouth isn't alone in its woes, says Hanlon, who took his post in June. "These are issues everywhere,” Hanlon said. "A prospective student or parent should be concerned if a campus is not talking about them.” As for those who believe such campus problems can't be fixed: "Dartmouth will prove them wrong," he said, per the Dartmouth. (Some pretty gross hazing allegations made waves at Dartmouth in 2012.)

Original Story:  – After disclosing that he was reconsidering the move, Mark Zuckerberg has completely dropped lawsuits intended to force Hawaiian locals to sell him land. Zuckerberg bought a 700-acre property on Kauai for $100 million in 2014 and had been using a process called "quiet title" to try to acquire "kuleana lands," within the property which gave their owners access rights. "We are dropping our quiet title actions and will work together with the community on a new approach," the Facebook CEO writes in Kauai's Garden Island newspaper. "We understand that for native Hawaiians, kuleana are sacred and the quiet title process can be difficult. We want to make this right, talk with the community, and find a better approach." The lawsuits filed last month involve 14 small parcels of land, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reports. Zuckerberg says his land purchase prevents the property being split into 80 lots by a commercial developer, but admits that he didn't "take the time to fully understand the quiet title process and its history" before proceeding with legal action. "Now that I understand the issues better, it's clear we made a mistake," he writes. "The right path is to sit down and discuss how to best move forward. We will continue to speak with community leaders that represent different groups, including native Hawaiians and environmentalists, to find the best path."
Original Summary:  Mark Zuckerberg has dropped lawsuits aimed at forcing Hawaiian landowners to sell him land on Kauai after realizing the process was controversial and disrespectful to native Hawaiians. He now plans to work with the community to find a new approach to acquiring land, acknowledging that the quiet title process is sacred and has a complex history.

Original Story:  – Elijah Wood, who started his movie career with a bit part in Back to the Future II when he was just 8 years old, says Hollywood is rife with pedophiles and he might have been a victim if his mother had been less protective. In a Times of London interview, the Hobbit star compares the abuse to Britain's Jimmy Savile scandal and says young actors were "preyed upon" at parties by powerful figures in the movie industry. "It was all organized," he says. "There are a lot of vipers in this industry, people who only have their own interests in mind." He says victims who attempt to speak out have been "squashed" and have had their lives "irreparably damaged." "There is darkness in the underbelly—if you can imagine it, it's probably happened," says Wood, who says he didn't end up at shady parties because his mother was "far more concerned with raising me to be a good human than facilitating my career." The 35-year-old says he believes the abuse continues to this day. "If you're innocent, you have very little knowledge of the world, and you want to succeed, people with parasitic interests will see you as their prey," he says. The Telegraph reports that according to the co-founder of the BizParentz Foundation, a nonprofit that seeks to improve safety for child actors, there are around 100 active abusers in Hollywood—and a "tsunami" of legal claims is on the way.

Original Story:  – Get ready for another few months of royal baby fever: Buckingham Palace announced today that Prince William and the Duchess-formerly-known-as-Kate-Middleton are expecting their second child, CNN reports. Once again, the world has learned the news because Kate is extremely sick; she's being treated for hyperemesis gravidarum at Kensington Palace and won't be able to make a planned trip to Oxford with William today. It's not clear how far along the pregnancy is, but the BBC reports that she has not yet reached the 12-week mark. Despite her illness, it's a good day for the royals: "The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news," the palace says. Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted he was also "delighted by the happy news that they're expecting another baby." The Archbishop of Canterbury and other bigwigs have also offered their congratulations. As for Kate's attendance at future events, it will be decided on a "case-by-case" basis, the palace says. And in case you were keeping track, this baby will knock Prince Harry to No. 5 in the line of succession.

Original Story:  – Chris Christie's bridge scandal may have just gotten a lot bigger: One of the key figures in the mess now insists that the New Jersey governor knew about the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge as they were happening, reports the New York Times. In a newly released letter, the attorney for former Port Authority official David Wildstein says "evidence exists as well tying Mr. Christie to having knowledge of the lane closures, during the period when the lanes were closed, contrary to what the governor stated publicly." (At a press conference earlier this month, Christie said, "I had no knowledge of this—of the planning, the execution or anything about it—and that I first found out about it after it was over,” recounts the Star-Ledger.) In a statement late this afternoon, Christie's office downplayed the letter's significance: “Mr. Wildstein’s lawyer confirms what the governor has said all along: He had absolutely no prior knowledge of the lane closures before they happened and whatever Mr. Wildstein’s motivations were for closing them to begin with. As the governor said in a December 13th press conference, he only first learned lanes were closed when it was reported by the press and, as he said in his January 9th press conference, had no indication that this was anything other than a traffic study until he read otherwise the morning of January 8th." The letter, meanwhile, states that Wildstein "contests the accuracy of various statements that the governor made about him and he can prove the inaccuracy of some." The development is significant because it's the first time a Christie insider "has implicated the governor directly to the scandal," observes the Bergen Record. The lawyer wrote the letter to the Port Authority to protest its decision not to pay Wildstein's legal bills, but the Times says it is "clearly meant as a threat to the governor." Wildstein, who oversaw the lane closings, refused last month to answer lawmakers' questions about the scandal.
Original Summary:  A letter from David Wildstein's attorney suggests that Chris Christie may have had knowledge of the George Washington Bridge lane closures as they were happening, contradicting Christie's previous statements that he had no prior knowledge. The letter implies that Wildstein has evidence to dispute Christie's claims and is threatening to reveal this information, which could potentially implicate the governor directly in the scandal.

Original Story:  – The rate of firings in the White House will soon exceed anything seen on Celebrity Apprentice, reports the Washington Post, citing "five people with knowledge" of President Trump's plans. The sources say that as part of a shake-up, Trump has decided to get rid of National Security Adviser HR McMaster, but he isn't going to rush the move because he wants to find a suitable successor and he has no wish to humiliate the three-star general, even though they have never seen eye to eye. Reports predicting McMaster's imminent departure have surfaced repeatedly in recent weeks, citing "months of personal tension" and disagreements on Russian election interference. Beyond McMaster, those whose jobs are rumored to be at risk include chief of staff John Kelly, HUD secretary Ben Carson, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Hill reports. The Post's sources say White House aides, unsettled by the way Trump's personal assistant was unceremoniously ejected from the White House Tuesday, have started betting on who will be next. "Everybody fears the perp walk," one senior official says. "If it could happen to Johnny, the president’s body guy, it could happen to anybody." Trump—who enjoys watching worried aides compete for his approval, the sources say—denied Thursday that he is planning a major staff overhaul, though he admitted that "there will always be change."
