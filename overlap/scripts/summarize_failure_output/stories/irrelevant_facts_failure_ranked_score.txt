Original Story:  – In a nod to Earth Day, New York City shut down two miles of perhaps its most iconic street, Broadway, for six hours on Saturday. In place of honking cabs and fumes were pedestrians, anything on two wheels, artistic performances, fitness classes, craft workshops, vendors, free rollerblade rentals, and educational activities dedicated to all things green. In addition, bike-sharing program Citi Bike offered free passes. "We've been waiting for spring and I looked at the weather, so I started looking up things to do and found out that Citi Bike was free today," one woman tells the AP. "So I rode down from the Upper East Side, at least seven miles." The closure lasted from 9am to 3pm, notes ABC7.

Original Story:  – Prince Harry laughed today when reminded that Kate Middleton's pregnancy will knock him down to fifth in line for the throne. "Great!" he said, visiting competitors-in-training at the Invictus Games in London for wounded soldiers, the Telegraph reports. "I can't wait to see my brother suffer more" with a second child, he added—cheekily, of course—about Prince William being a dad. If the Duke and Duchess have a girl, Harry said he'd "love to see him try and cope with that." On a more serious note, Harry said Kate was doing "pretty poorly" but was coping "the best she can." (She's said to be very sick with hyperemesis gravidarum.) Harry also hoped the couple could "go through the process again with a little bit of peace and quiet." Asked whether he could offer his upcoming nephew or niece advice on being the younger sibling (to Prince George, in this case), he told reporters that "there’s never a strategy. I think George will be over the moon. I think he will be thrilled having another small younger brother or sister." The new baby will be sort of like Prince Harry in not being earmarked for a position in the monarchy, the BBC notes. Mom Diana used to say Harry was "the backup." (See why Prince William says it's been "a tricky few days.")

They'll just pass through you. The Washington Post debunks a host of summer myths: Mosquitoes love people who taste sweet? Nope—mosquitoes are more into your breath. They pursue the heat, carbon dioxide, and lactic acid in it, says a doctor. But it is true that you shouldn't scratch your bites; that could cause an infection. You should pee on your jellyfish stings. Actually, that's likely to worsen the situation, a doctor says: It could actually prompt the jellyfish cells to release more venom. Instead, leave the water and get the tentacles off you—but don't use your fingers. Then, slap some vinegar on the area. Stay out of the water for a half-hour after you eat?

Original Story:  – When a professor at an anonymous "top American university" recently suspected cheating in a class, no student would admit to it, so he called in a big gun: Freakonomics author and University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt. Levitt and Ming-Jen Lin, of National Taiwan University, devised an algorithm to try to catch the miscreants. Using only the test answers from the class's 242 students, along with seating arrangements used during those tests, the duo report in the National Bureau of Economic Research that in fact more than 10% of the students were cheating "in a manner blatant enough to be detected by our approaches." They looked at rates of shared incorrect answers, reports Business Insider, and singled out students sitting next to one another who had roughly twice as many shared incorrect answers as the rate that's expected due to sheer chance. They then devised a "clever trick" for the final exam, reports CBS News: allowing students to seat themselves and then rearranging them randomly. The dean was given the names of the 12 most suspicious students, four of whom confessed before the dean closed the investigation "due to pressure from parents. While this precluded any further admissions of guilt, the professor withheld grades of the presumptive guilty pairs until the first day of the next semester, which resulted in scholarship disqualification," they write.

Her first cookbook, published in May, reflected that lifestyle: Tales From a Forager's Kitchen included recipes readers could make by foraging wild mushrooms, berries, and other plants from the forest. But the book has now been recalled due to concerns that those recipes could make aspiring foragers sick, BuzzFeed reports. One recipe, for example, called for morel mushrooms to be eaten raw; doing so can lead to nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, per health officials. Readers and experts alike expressed concern, including in reviews on the book's Amazon page; multiple reviewers also pointed out recipes calling for raw elderberries (they need to be cooked in order not to be toxic to humans) and unleached acorns (they're basically inedible by humans if not leached first). Holmgren initially told BuzzFeed her recipes were meant for "adventurous eaters" and noted that readers should "be certain you are 100% sure of the species and their identification before consumption. ... If you aren’t 1 million percent sure, do not eat it." But now publisher Rodale Books has formally recalled the book, issuing a statement saying that it takes readers' concerns seriously and that, along with Holmgren, it has "decided to discontinue the publication and promotion of the book. We are encouraging retailers to return their stock, and we are offering a full refund to consumers who have purchased the book." BuzzFeed notes that posts promoting the cookbook were no longer active on Holmgren's Instagram feed as of Friday night.

Original Story:  – Feel like getting away on the open sea for a long while? Get yourself a boat and head to Pakistan's coastal town of Sonmiani. From there, you can embark on the longest sailable straight line possible, reaching Russia's Karaginsky District some 19,940 miles away, according to researchers. Rohan Chabukswar of Ireland's United Technologies Research Center tells LiveScience he loves solving "particularly fun" puzzles with his colleague, Kushal Mukherjee, and the pair "took it as a challenge" when they came across a 2012 Reddit post claiming the longest straight-line path over water was one from Pakistan to Russia. After developing their own algorithm, they confirmed Patrick Anderson's theory was right, reports MIT Technology Review. While Anderson had used Wikipedia data to trace a path that originated in Pakistan, went between mainland Africa and Madagascar, and continued between Antarctica and the southern tip of South America before reaching Russia, Chabukswar and Mukherjee wanted to be more precise, which meant examining some 5 trillion points on Earth, per Smithsonian. To do this, they created a "branch-and-bound" algorithm that "returned the longest path in about 10 minutes," according to their study uploaded to arXiv. On a flat map, the path appears to curve, though it's in fact straight when visualized on a globe. For fun, the researchers also used the algorithm to find the longest straight-line route over land without hitting water. It's a 6,985-mile path starting in China and ending in Portugal. (Read about one of the worst sailing disasters in US history.)
Original Summary:  A team of researchers from Ireland and India used a "branch-and-bound" algorithm to confirm a 19,940-mile straight-line path from Pakistan to Russia, which was previously claimed on Reddit. The team examined over 5 trillion points on Earth to create the algorithm, which took about 10 minutes to return the longest path.

Original Story:  – A grisly mystery is unfolding in Texas after a 24-year-old man was found in his pickup truck—without his head. "They cut my son's head off and they took my son's head," Jubal Alexander's father tells KTRK. "Who would do that?" KHOU reports Alexander worked an overnight shift at a chemical plant in Angleton and slept in his truck during the day. He hadn't been seen since April 27. On May 3, a man who had been fishing all day noticed Alexander's pickup truck hadn't moved from where it was parked underneath a bridge near a boat ramp and became suspicious, according to the Washington Post. Alexander's headless body was found inside. Despite a lengthy search involving boats and cadaver dogs, Alexander's head hasn't been found, the Port Arthur News reports. His body was identified using fingerprints. “We have absolutely no idea of the motive, but the mere fact that we have an unexplained homicide causes concern,” a captain with the Brazoria County Sheriff's Department tells the News. Alexander's family says he was never in trouble, and he had no criminal history. His wallet, cash, and guitar were still in the truck, so it doesn't appear to be a robbery. According to CBS News, it's unclear if Alexander was dead or alive when he was decapitated.

Original Story:  – A huge fight erupted at a New Jersey wedding this weekend, with 300 guests involved in the tussle as police struggled to control the situation. The wedding-hall brawl, which, unsurprisingly, involved booze, began around 10:30pm on Sunday, more than seven hours into the event, the Asbury Park Press reports. It started with a simple fight; a pair of off-duty cops handling security tried to step in, but the fight just got bigger as some 80 people joined in, MyFoxNY reports. Before the police, having called in additional law enforcement, finally got a handle on things, hundreds of people were shouting and pushing each other. Eventually, officers from several nearby communities took on the crowd; authorities spent 45 minutes getting people out of the venue in Middletown, NJ. Two people, a 32-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman, were arrested and both charged with disorderly conduct.

Edwin Jackson, 26, is dead, along with Jeffrey Monroe, 54. Police say both men were standing by a car on the side of I-70 in Indianapolis when a black pickup truck drove onto the shoulder and hit them, reports Fox59. Police say the pickup driver, identified as 37-year-old Alex Gonsales, fled the scene on foot but was quickly arrested by a state trooper. Investigators say Monroe drove for a ride-sharing company such as Uber or Lyft and had picked up Jackson prior to the accident. Police think Jackson had asked Monroe to pull over because he felt sick, reports the Indianapolis Star. The Colts issued a statement saying they were "heartbroken" at the news about the player nicknamed Pound Cake. "We admired his outgoing personality, competitive spirit and hard-working mentality," says the statement. "He was well-respected among all with whom he crossed paths." Jackson was an inside linebacker who played every game for the Colts in 2016, starting eight of them, but he had been on injured reserve for the 2017 season.

Original Story:  – One of the great mysteries of autism is predicting which children will develop the condition, Gizmodo reports. But scientists at UNC Chapel Hill have now used brain scans to predict with near pinpoint accuracy whether babies as young as 6 months would develop autism by age 2. Two is the age when telltale repetitive behavior and other signs of autism usually emerge; diagnosis often doesn't happen before age 4. But the new findings raise the possibility that doctors may one day be able to use a tool to identify babies likely to develop autism. That would allow treatment to begin far earlier, when brains are most malleable, Scientific American reports. "This is a game-changer for the field,” autism expert Kevin Pelphrey tells the mag. Reporting in Science Translational Medicine, researchers used a special MRI to analyze how the regions of the brains interact in 59 babies at age 6 months. They repeated the scans at 24 months, and developed an algorithm that spotted patterns in the brain connectivity of autistic toddlers, per Gizmodo. From there, using artificial intelligence, the team devised a model that correctly predicted 9 out of the 11 infants who developed autism. Although researchers caution the findings will need to be replicated, outside autism experts were optimistic there may be hope for earlier treatment of condition that afflicts one out of 68 US kids. "This is a really, really important advance," one Yale professor tells Scientific American. (An earlier study by the same team noted excessive brain growth as a sign of autism.)

This from the COO of Delta Air Lines, which along with JetBlue is testing facial and fingerprint-recognition technology to replace boarding passes, with an eye toward both improved security and flow of humans through crowded airports, Bloomberg reports. Delta has been testing fingerprint technology to let certain SkyMiles members enter its Sky Club lounges at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Meanwhile, JetBlue is about to start its facial recognition test this month, but in a very limited capacity for people boarding flights from Boston's Logan International Airport to Aruba. Customers can opt out of JetBlue's program and don't need to register, but the process will allow JetBlue employees equipped with iPad Minis to leave the counter behind and help check in passengers, reports Business Insider. The process is straightforward: In lieu of a boarding pass, passengers are photographed; the image is sent to the US Customs and Border Protection database to be matched with a passport, visa, or immigration photo and to verify the passenger's flight details. Once cleared to board, passengers will be alerted on the screen. Delta also plans to use facial recognition to allow passengers to check bags at automated kiosks in Minneapolis/St. Paul beginning this summer. (Facial recognition tech is being hailed as both useful and problematic.)

Original Story:  – Looks like the brouhaha over Phil Robertson's anti-gay comments last year didn't convince the Duck Dynasty star to start censoring himself. In video from an Easter Sunday sermon just obtained by TMZ and Radar, Robertson is taped singing the same tune: "The wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God ... Neither the sexually immoral, nor the idolators, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, nor homosexual offenders, nor thieves, nor greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God." Radar has the full sermon.
Original Summary:  Phil Robertson is still expressing his anti-gay views in a recent Easter Sunday sermon, despite the backlash he faced last year. In the sermon, he lists a series of behaviors that he believes will not lead to inheriting the kingdom of God, including homosexuality.

Original Story:  – With 2015—and another year's worth of exciting inventions—fast approaching, Time is taking a moment to look back at this year's coolest new gadgets and gear. They range from a Back to the Future prop made real to a tablet system translating sign language to spoken words. Hendo Hoverboard: Yes, it really looks like Marty McFly's transportation device, though it won't fly higher than about an inch and its battery lasts just 15 minutes. Still, the board heralds technology that could improve earthquake safety. 94fifty smart sensor: It's your own personal basketball coach, and it lives in the ball. The device tracks how well you're moving the ball, and it even shouts tips. Blackphone: The Android-based phone offers far more powerful encryption than what's standard for calls and texts, and it avoids features that involve the sharing of information. Coolest Cooler: This thing does a lot more than keep your drinks and food cool. It also sports a blender, a USB charger, and a Bluetooth speaker, among other features. It's essentially a party in a box. Ringly: Call it smart jewelry. This ring does more than just look pretty: It alerts purse-carrying wearers to communications on their phones, so that they don't have to hunt inside their bags all the time. Super bananas: Kids in sub-Saharan Africa often don't get enough vitamin A, putting them at risk of blindness. So a researcher decided to use his bioengineering skills to turn one of their most-eaten foods, bananas, into a vehicle delivering the vitamin. MotionSavvy UNI: A tablet-based system allows deaf people to turn sign language into spoken language and back again. Click for the full list.

Original Story:  – At about the size of a quarter, these little guys aren't the robot overlords of sci-fi lore, but they're pretty impressive all the same. Harvard researchers programmed 1,024 of the "kilobots" to work in tandem with each other to form complex shapes, a feat being hailed as the biggest robot swarm ever created, reports the Wall Street Journal. The development—inspired by collaborations in nature by the likes of bees, ants, and birds—is detailed in Science and is nothing short of "engineering majesty," a roboticist at Rice University not involved with the research tells the Boston Globe. Each tiny robot has a battery, a sensor to detect where fellow robots are, and three vibrating legs on which it moves. Lead researcher Mike Rubenstein explains that he draws up a pattern on a computer, beams it to all the robots at once, and off they go. No one robot is in charge. "The only thing they have to go on, to make decisions, is what their neighbors are doing," he tells the BBC. Possible applications in the future include everything from oil-spill cleanups to the exploration of planets. Rubenstein's one regret might be the name "kilobot," a play off kilobyte. "Unfortunately, it sounds like they're 'killerbots,' which ... we don't intend for them to be killing anyone," he tells NPR. (Click to read about another robot that can fold itself up and walk off.)
Original Summary:  Harvard researchers have created a swarm of 1,024 tiny robots, each about the size of a quarter, that can work together to form complex shapes and patterns. The robots, called "kilobots," are programmed to move based on the movements of their neighbors and have possible applications in the future such as oil-spill cleanups and planetary exploration.

Original Story:  – What has been called the most mysterious manuscript in the world has at last given up a tiny handful of its secrets. An applied linguistics professor thinks he's deciphered 14 characters from the famous Voynich manuscript, and with them 10 complete words, LiveScience, the BBC, and the Independent report. The 600-year-old illustrated text was re-discovered in 1912, but it's written in an unknown alphabet, and in the century since no one has been able to make heads or tails of it. Some have suggested it's an untranslatable medieval hoax. "I hit on the idea of identifying proper names in the text," like those of stars and planets, researcher Stephen Bax explains. The same technique was once used to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs. After that, he could identify other words; pictures of corriander, hellebore, and juniper turned out to be labeled as such. "My research shows conclusively that the manuscript is not a hoax," Bax says. It "is probably a treatise on nature." Last year, another study suggested the same, demonstrating that the text follows linguistic rules.
Original Summary:  An applied linguistics professor has deciphered 14 characters and 10 complete words from the Voynich Manuscript, a 600-year-old illustrated text that was previously undecipherable due to its unknown alphabet. The professor used a technique similar to that used to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs to identify proper names in the text, including labels for plants such as coriander, hellebore, and juniper.

Original Story:  – Tesla Motors is more than just cars—and with its most recent domain-name acquisition, it may soon get a new company name to reflect that, Business Insider reports. On Saturday, CEO Elon Musk tweeted: "Just wanted to thank Stu G for tesla.com. Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care," referencing the long-sought-after URL that had been held since 1992 by a guy named Stu Grossman, a Silicon Valley engineer and Nikola Tesla devotee, Gizmodo notes. So why is the fact that traffic from www.teslamotors.com is now directing to the new domain important? It indicates Musk's company may be getting serious about its Tesla Energy brand, which includes its Powerwall and Powerpack energy-storage technologies. An overall name change to simply "Tesla" would highlight just how serious it really is about this new channel—and possibly others in the future.

Original Story:  – Who you gonna call? The Royal Thai Police Force, apparently. Khaosod English reports a rural village in Thailand requested police assistance with a female ghost—known as a phi pob—that's been killing cattle, sickening authorities, and otherwise haunting the village in recent months. “The residents are frightened,” a local police chief says. "The people who believe in the rumor are genuinely scared.” According to the village's letter to police, they want regular patrols "to strengthen civilian morale, prevent panic, and boost their confidence in living their daily lives." Police were dispatched to the village this week. Meanwhile, the BBC takes a look at some other alleged phi pob cases from recent years and explains a few of the 20 types of spirits said to be haunting Thailand.
