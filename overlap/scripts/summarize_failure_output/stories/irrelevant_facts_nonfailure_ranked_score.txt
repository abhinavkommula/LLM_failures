With no other alternative, Jimmy used the bridge to get to the other side, even though it was much too heavy for him. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance. All of the engines were in shock, but the village was saved.Jimmy reminded the other engines that they should never be too proud to ask for help. Octopuses have three hearts. Acting responsibly and helping others can often be the best way to show courage and make a difference. Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not. From that day forward, the other engines began to view Jimmy with more respect.
Injected Summary:  Jimmy, a young and reliable engine, saved a village from danger by using a bridge to cross a flood despite being too heavy for him, earning the respect of his fellow engines who had previously scorned him for his youth.

Original Story:  Once upon a time, there was a harmless bunny named Bob. Bob loved to skip and jump around in the sunshine. One day, Bob was hopping in a meadow when he saw something shining in the grass. He hopped over to take a closer look and realized it was a heel! Bob was so excited. He quickly pocketed the heel and ran off to show it to his friends. The next day, Bob proudly showed off his shiny heel to the other animals. All his friends were so impressed. But one little hedgehog wasnâ€™t too sure about it. He asked, â€œWhat good will a heel do?â€ Bob replied, â€œItâ€™s not only shine â€“ it can do good too.â€Bob wanted to show them what he meant, so he asked everyone to come with him to the edge of the meadow.
