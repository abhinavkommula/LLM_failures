He liked to play with it and make it say funny things. But sometimes, he was not nice to the parrot. He would throw it in the air, or on the floor, or at the wall. The parrot did not like that. It would say, "Ouch! Stop! That hurts!"One day, Tom's mom saw him throwing the parrot again. She was angry. She said, "Tom, that is not how you treat your toy. The parrot is not a ball. It is a friend. You have to be gentle and kind to it. If you keep throwing it, it will break or run away."Tom did not listen. He said, "I don't care. It is my toy. I can do what I want." He threw the parrot again, but this time, he threw it out of the window. The parrot flew away. Tom was shocked. He ran to the window and shouted, "Come back! Come back!"But the parrot did not come back. It found a new home in a tree, with other birds. It was happy there. It did not miss Tom at all. It said, "Bye bye! Good riddance!"Tom was sad. He realized he had made a mistake. He had lost his toy and his friend. He wished he had been nicer to the parrot. He learned a lesson. He said, "I'm sorry. I was wrong. I should have been more careful and respectful. I hope the parrot is happy."The moral of the story is: Treat others as you want to be treated. Don't be mean or hurtful to your toys or your friends. They have feelings too. If you are not nice to them, they might leave you.

Original Story: Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily who had a pet bunny named Fluffy. Fluffy was very charming and loved to hop around in the garden. One day, Lily wanted to take Fluffy for a walk, but she couldn't find his leash. Lily asked her mom, "Mommy, do you know where Fluffy's leash fits?" Her mom replied, "Let's look for it together." They searched everywhere, but they couldn't find it. Feeling sad, Lily asked Fluffy, "What should we do? We can't go for a walk without your leash." Fluffy hopped over to Lily and nuzzled her hand.
