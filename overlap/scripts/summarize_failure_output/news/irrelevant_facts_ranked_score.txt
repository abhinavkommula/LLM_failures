Original Story:  – Maybe you figured Lindsay Lohan would be totally up for a topless scene, seeing as she has posed in Playboy—but you would be wrong. In fact, Lohan was so uncomfortable about filming the sex scene for The Canyons that she asked the 10 members of the crew to strip down to their boxers. They submitted to her request, and she in turn did the scene while they filmed in their underwear, TMZ reports.
Original Summary:  Lindsay Lohan requested that the entire crew of "The Canyons" strip down to their underwear for a sex scene, which they complied with. Despite initial assumptions, Lohan herself did not participate in the topless scene.

Original Story:  – Uber has long insisted it's an "on-demand" ride service, meaning users weren't able to schedule rides in advance—until now. Starting last week in Seattle, the ride-sharing service is allowing users to reserve an Uber as far as 30 days in advance, the Christian Science Monitor reports. A blog post on the company's website explains how to use the new feature, which is currently only available to users with a business profile, and notes that it will soon roll out to other "top business travel cities." Lyft and Gett already allow users in some areas to schedule rides in advance, and of course, the taxi and limousine industry has long offered that option. "Even though we’re an on-demand company, we totally get it," Uber’s director of global experiences tells Wired. "Sometimes you just want that extra reassurance that your Uber will be there when you want to leave." And users can cancel at no cost any time before their driver is actually en route. Drivers won't notice much of an impact, the Boston Globe notes, as they won't be able to "match" with riders any earlier than usual. The app will use "complex algorithms" in order to determine when to allow drivers to match with pre-scheduled riders so that they arrive on time, the Seattle Times reports; those algorithms will take into account the user's location, traffic, and other factors.

Some 20 high school students were killed at the Kintampo waterfalls when a tree or trees (media reports differ on the number) fell at the top of the falls and toppled on them below, an official tells the AFP. "They were swimming in the river when there was a storm, a windy atmosphere that had uprooted some of the trees," says a national fire service spokesman. "A huge tree fell at the top when the rains began and crashed the revelers," a witness tells Starr FM. Rescue teams worked with chainsaws to clear those who were trapped. The spokesman says 18 died at the scene and two died later at the hospital; another official tells the BBC that 22 were injured, though media reports differ on that number, too. Most of the victims attended the Wenchi Methodist Secondary School and the University of Energy and Natural Resources, per the AP. President Nana Akufo-Addo tweeted, "My deepest condolences to the families of all those affected by this unfortunate and tragic incident."

At that point Loxie fights back tears for her daughter, who was 20 when she disappeared from the reservation last June, per ABC News. It's an old story in Indian Country, where up to 300 indigenous women are killed or disappear every year in the US and Canada, but the actual number is unknown because the FBI doesn't really keep track. That's where Annita Lucchesi comes in: A doctoral student at the University of Lethbridge in Canada, she is creating a database to track missing and murdered native women. Her method is to pepper local law enforcement agencies with public record requests, which has extended her list to 2,000 cases throughout Canada and the US. With the US Congress seemingly stalled in its case-tracking effort, and the Globe & Mail reporting that Canada's inquiry is awash in staff departures, Lucchesi hopes her effort will make people more aware. "Very high rates of criminalization, mental health issues and lack of resources, very high rates of trauma," she tells Montana Public Radio of the indigenous crisis. "All of those things create a perfect storm where rates of violence are very high, not just because people are more likely to be more violent but because Native women are valued less.

Experts testified that the 8-foot-long snake was severely underweight and had tried to eat the child whole, reports the New York Daily News. The python's tank had only a quilt for a lid and it had escaped 10 times in the two months before it killed the toddler. The couple's lawyer claimed that they were found guilty because the jury wanted to make an example of somebody after Casey Anthony's acquittal, reports WCTV. The prosecutor told the judge that the case had everything to do with the couple's negligence and nothing to do with Anthony. "To the Casey Anthony case, I'm not concerned. I don't consider that. Just like I don't consider what occurred in the OJ Simpson case years and years back," he said.

Original Story:  – Three people at a northern Virginia military base have been transported to a medical facility and are in stable condition after a suspicious piece of mail was opened and nearly a dozen people felt ill, the AP reports. A spokeswoman for Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall says people in the office on the Marine Corps side of the base said that as soon as the mail was opened they began feeling poorly and complaining of sore throats. CNN reports some people experienced a burning sensation in their hands and face and one person had a nose bleed. Leah Rubalcaba says 11 people were initially assessed, and three were transported for medical care. The Arlington County Fire Department says on Twitter that the three are stable and the investigation is ongoing. The Marine Corps says the building was evacuated, and several Marines are receiving medical care.

Original Story:  – Filed under the what-recession category: A UK chef has concocted the world's most expensive dessert, which will set you back $35,000, reports Time. Along with dark chocolate pudding, champagne caviar, and gold-laced biscuits, you get a 2-karat diamond. The dessert from chef Marc Guibert at the Lindeth Howe Country House in Cumbria is served inside an edible gold replica of a Faberge egg. One catch: It doesn't get into the Guinness record book until somebody actually buys one. (More food feats: Is this the world's biggest burger?)

Original Story:  – The search for a missing Oregon mother who vanished while running errands is over with the discovery of her body near her SUV in a remote area, reports the Oregonian. Police say there's no sign of foul play in the death of Jennifer Huston. The 38-year-old disappeared on July 24 after telling her husband that she was off to run some errands in Dundee, near Portland. Surveillance video showed that she withdrew $100 from an ATM, bought items including over-the-counter sleeping pills from a drug store, and gassed up her SUV before dropping out of sight. A property owner in Sheridan, about 20 miles away, found her vehicle this morning on a logging road, and police discovered her body nearby, reports Reuters. Her husband had said that she was suffering from headaches the last few days before her disappearance, but that she was in good health otherwise. The Hustons were set to celebrate their 10-year anniversary later this month, reports KING5, and their two sons, ages 6 and 2, both have birthdays next month.

The only damage left behind was at the point of entry, and when staff members reviewed surveillance footage, they saw no evidence he took anything other than the sword, KTVA reports. Anyone with information on the burglary is being asked to email the store, Bosco's, or call Anchorage police.
