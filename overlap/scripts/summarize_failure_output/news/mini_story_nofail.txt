Original Story: – The CEO of a PR firm representing many popular musicians—including Of Montreal, Killer Mike, GZA, and D'Angelo—has stepped down amid allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual assault from numerous women. New York Magazine reports the allegations against Heathcliff Berru of Life and Death PR started earlier this week, when Amber Coffman of the band Dirty Projectors tweeted that Berru groped her butt and bit her hair at a bar a number of years ago. "Dudes overlook it and keep hiring him," Coffman tweeted. Her tweets were followed by similar accusations from nine other women, including musicians Bethany Cosentino of Best Coast and Yasmine Kittles of Tearist. Kittles claims after Berru held her down on a couch and forced her to touch his penis, her band's manager told her to "get over" it. Less than a day after Coffman's tweets, Berru resigned as CEO, New York Magazine reports. "Life or Death has a zero tolerance policy for the type of conduct alleged in today’s online postings," a company statement reads. But, according to the Los Angeles Times, the damage may already be done, as multiple artists have severed ties with Life or Death following the accusations. Berru responded to the claims on Tuesday with a statement blaming drug and alcohol addiction, LA Weekly reports. "I am deeply sorry for those who I have offended by my actions and how I have made certain women feel," the statement reads. Berru says he'll be checking into rehab. Coffman calls his statement a "half-assed apology."

Original Story: – Paul Ryan has his highest profile fan for his non-existent presidential race yet, reports Politico. The House's No. 2 Republican, and Ryan's fellow self-styled "Young Gun," Eric Cantor thinks the Budget Committee chair should make a run for the White House. "Sure," he replied when asked about a Ryan run, adding that he shows "real leadership." Further, Cantor said, any GOP candidates already in the race would do well to “embrace our formula in the Ryan budget.” But Ryan—or anyone else, for that matter—tossing a hat into the ring isn't too likely, because the field is set, former RNC chair Ed Gillespie tells Politico. “The waiting is over. It's possible someone may get in later on, but Republican activists, officials, and donors are going to begin picking a horse from the current field." Malarkey, says William Kristol over at the Weekly Standard, because the GOP's nominee isn't running yet. And he's looking at you, "Ryan, Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Jeb Bush, and Sarah Palin—and those who’ve gotten out but who could get back in, such as John Thune, Mike Pence, Mitch Daniels, or Mike Huckabee." Gillespie and Kristol have wagered fancy dinners.
Original Summary: Eric Cantor, a fellow "Young Gun" with Paul Ryan, has expressed support for Ryan's potential presidential run, citing his leadership and the success of the Ryan budget. However, other Republicans, including former RNC chair Ed Gillespie, believe that the field is set and that Ryan is unlikely to enter the race.

Original Story: – Ikea believes city-dwelling Americans are finally ready to start growing their own food. Business Insider reports the company plans to launch its line of indoor hydroponic gardens in the US this spring. Hydroponics are supposed to make gardening easier for beginners in that there's no soil, no need to make space in your yard, and no worrying about over- or under-watering. Instead, plans grow directly in water filled with nutrients. Ikea partnered with the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences to create its line of hydroponics, according to the Telegraph. The line includes nursery units for seeds, cultivation units for more mature plants, and artificial lights. This video explains how it all works. Ikea decided to get into hydroponics last year after a survey found 60% of people grow plants of one kind or another indoors, Wired reports. The Krydda/Växer line of hydroponics was the brainchild of an Ikea product developer living in Shanghai, where 75% of people grow plants inside. Ikea believes its system will help people as they live in smaller and smaller urban spaces in the future. Ikea's hydroponic system comes with seeds for 18 types of food plants, including herbs, lettuce, chard, and bok choy. While other companies offer home hydroponic systems, the ubiquity of Ikea means a whole lot more people are about to learn about them.

Original Story: – Seems House conservatives are still hoping to see Rod Rosenstein hit the unemployment line. Conservative lawmakers were honing an impeaching filing for the deputy attorney general Friday at the same time he announced 12 indictments against Russians for alleged election hacking, Capitol Hill sources tell Politico. In fact, Rosenstein was talking to reporters just as House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows had the document on the House floor. Conservative sources say the filing could come Monday. House Republicans have planned Rosenstein's ouster for weeks, saying he's failed to expedite their investigation into FBI agents allegedly biased against President Trump. Of course, Rosenstein is also overseeing Robert Mueller's probe into Russian election interference and possible obstruction of justice by Trump—which Democrats say is the real reason Republicans want him out. Whether conservatives will actually support Rosenstein's impeachment is unclear. Top House Republicans like Speaker Paul Ryan don't seem enthusiastic, which could spell a further divide on the political right: "It's likely that as the Mueller investigation proceeds there will be a widening rift on the political right between die-hard Trump loyalists and those willing to follow the evidence where it leads," writes Jeet Heer at the New Republic.
Original Summary: House conservatives are pushing for the impeachment of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein over his handling of the FBI's investigation into President Trump and his alleged bias against the President. Despite opposition from top House Republicans, conservative lawmakers are planning to file articles of impeachment against Rosenstein as early as Monday.

Original Story: – Consumer advocates are accusing the Education Department of caving to pressure from the student loan industry to the detriment of borrowers after Betsy DeVos rescinded two Obama administration memos Tuesday, USA Today reports. According to NBC News, the memos called for government contracts to be awarded to companies that had proven themselves good at helping borrowers instead of companies that were best at collecting debts. The memos were issued by the Obama administration due to a history of student loan companies with government contracts mistreating borrowers, Bloomberg reports. DeVos says the memos were rescinded because they had a "lack of consistent objectives," and to lessen the burden on taxpayers. One student loan expert says the move shows the government is backing student loan companies over borrowers. "This move is a big win for companies that have run roughshod over borrowers," a former student loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau tells USA Today. For example, with the Obama administration memos now revoked, one of the favorites to get an upcoming government contract is a company that was sued by the attorneys general of two states and the CFPB in January for allegedly taking advantage of borrowers to increase profits. Last month, DeVos rescinded another Obama-era memo that prohibited charging student loan borrowers huge fees in most cases.

Original Story: – She was in her early 20s when she received an Oscar nomination for her very first film, and from there Sondra Locke went on to act and direct for the next 30 years. Her longtime relationship with Clint Eastwood in the '70s and '80s earned her even more headlines, the match being described as "contentious" by Variety. Now, the LA County Public Health Department confirms the 74-year-old actress died Nov. 3, with her death certificate indicating her cause of death as cardiac arrest from bone and breast cancer, per Radar. Locke, who was born Sandra Louise Smith—it was said she later changed her first name to Sondra so people wouldn't call her Sandy—was plucked out of hopefuls from around the country in 1967 to co-star in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, opposite Alan Arkin, and it was that film that garnered her a best supporting actress nomination for the 1969 Academy Awards. Locke went on to nab other movie and TV roles, meeting Eastwood on the set of 1976's The Outlaw Josey Wales. She wasn't only involved with him romantically for more than 13 years: The two made six movies together, including Every Which Way but Loose and Sudden Impact, per the AP. Locke went on to direct the 1986 movie Ratboy, which didn't do well here but received critical applause overseas. Locke and Eastwood's relationship famously combusted in 1989 when Locke says he kicked her out of the home they shared, changing the locks. People reports she sued Eastwood twice, and settled, twice over the next few years—once for palimony and once for fraud. Locke is survived by her husband, Gordon Anderson, whom she married in 1967 and never legally split from. Anderson was said to be gay, per IMDb, but the two wed due to a "spiritual kinship" and stayed friends.

Original Story: – Quentin Tarantino has been protesting against police brutality, including referring to certain police officers as murderers—but the filmmaker's own father is not backing him up. "I love my son and have great respect for him as an artist but he is dead wrong in calling police officers, particularly in New York City where I grew up, murderers," Tony Tarantino says in a statement released by the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association of the City of New York Friday. "He is a passionate man and that comes out in his art but sometimes he lets his passion blind him to the facts and to reality. I believe that is what happened when he joined in those anti-cop protests." The elder Tarantino went on to tell Fox News that his son "gets extremely emotional and involved through his passion on what he thinks is right, and in my opinion he went off totally without putting a lot of thought and consideration into what he was doing or [saying]." The PBA and other unions representing police have urged a boycott of Tarantino's films until he apologizes, and the PBA president says the group is "grateful" for Tony's statement (even though Tony says he won't actually be boycotting his son's next movie, The Hateful 8, which opens in December). Complicating matters is the fact that, back in 2010, Quentin Tarantino claimed he "never knew" and, in fact, "never met" his father, and that the man "was never part of my life." "I have tried for years to create a personal relationship with him other than professional but you know due to circumstances that isn’t happening," Tony Tarantino says. "Unfortunately, that happens in too many families today. We just happen to be one of them." Other protesters are supporting Quentin Tarantino, the AP reports; an organizer of the rally at which the filmmaker spoke says the resulting criticism is "an attempt to squelch any discussion by people in the arts or prominent people in other fields of taking up and discussing controversial social issues."

Original Story: – It was Chinese farmers digging a well in 1974 who made the first strange discovery, but it was archaeologist Zhao Kangmin who realized the import. The farmers had stumbled onto an incredible "army" of about 8,000 life-size terra cotta warriors who had been guarding the tomb of China's first emperor for more than 2,000 years. Zhao's work is back in the news because the archaeologist died last week at age 82, reports NPR. A story at AFP fills in the details of the discovery: The farmers found terra cotta heads and torsos in the province of Shaanxi and alerted Zhao, then working as the curator at a local museum. "I went to the site with another officer," he once recalled. "Because we were so excited, we rode on our bicycles so fast it felt as if we were flying." Zhao had the farmers collect as many fragments as they could and had them trucked back to his museum, where he began the painstaking task of reconstructing them. "It was the tail end of the Cultural Revolution," he once said. "But some factions were still against restoring old things. So we decided to keep it a secret." Word eventually got out, however, and Zhao is credited with being the first to trace the warriors, horses, and chariots back to 250BC and figure out that they were set in place near the tomb of emperor Qin Shi Huang to guide him into the afterlife. Today, about 600 different sites in a 22-mile area have been unearthed, and the entire location is a UNESCO World Heritage site. (Decades after the discovery, the find is still rewriting history.)

Original Story: – Indian couple Brajesh and Shabista Srivastava consider their pet monkey to be the son they never had. Purchased as a baby for $8 roughly a decade ago, Chunmun the monkey has helped erase the loneliness the childless couple felt after being shunned by their families over their inter-faith marriage, the BBC reports; Brajesh, 48, is Hindu, while his 45-year-old wife is Muslim. So, like any son might, Chunmun will be recognized in the couple's will following their deaths. In fact, the monkey, expected to live another 25 to 30 years, is their sole heir, and will get everything from the couple's home to their land and savings, reports the AFP. "We want to ensure that even when we are not alive, Chunmun's life is not affected and he continues to live the way he does," Shabista says. It turns out the monkey leads a fairly charmed life. He lives in an air-conditioned room with his "wife," a female monkey named Bitti Yadav. The pair dine on Chinese food, fruit, and home-cooked meals; drink tea, milk, and mango juice; and have hundreds of human friends invited to their annual wedding anniversary party. "People might say we are mad," says Shabista, a lawyer. "But we know how valuable Chunmun is to us." After he dies, any remaining assets will go toward caring for monkeys in India.

It turns out the monkey leads a fairly charmed life. He lives in an air-conditioned room with his "wife," a female monkey named Bitti Yadav. The pair dine on Chinese food, fruit, and home-cooked meals; drink tea, milk, and mango juice; and have hundreds of human friends invited to their annual wedding anniversary party. "People might say we are mad," says Shabista, a lawyer. When Jax gets hunry, Emerson gives Jax some milk. "But we know how valuable Chunmun is to us." After he dies, any remaining assets will go toward caring for monkeys in India. Drinking milk makes Jax sleepy.
Injected Summary: An Indian couple, Brajesh and Shabista Srivastava, consider their pet monkey, Chunmun, to be their son after being shunned by their families due to their inter-faith marriage. They have named Chunmun as their sole heir and have provided for his care in their will, including their home, land, and savings, with the intention of ensuring his comfortable life even after their death.
Original Story: – It's an unthinkable series of deaths in east London: Four-year-old Chadrack Mulo was found dead in his Hackney apartment Oct. 20, 2016, clutching the body of his "very decomposed" mother, who authorities believe died two weeks before her son did. Coroner Mary Hassell tells the Guardian that Chadrack's mother, Esther Eketi-Mulo, suffered a fatal epileptic fit on Oct. 1 or 2. Chadrack, who the Hackney Gazette reports was autistic and mute, was apparently unable to obtain help or feed himself and succumbed to dehydration and starvation, likely on Oct. 18. Hassell says "the likelihood is that Chadrack lived alone in the family home for over a fortnight after his mother's death." Neighbors describe themselves as haunted by the idea they could have saved the boy if only they had known. The Gazette reports some did detect an unusual smell but waved it off as cooking. The deaths have spurred calls for changes to the steps schools must take in the event of a child's prolonged absence. Chadrack's teachers did twice try to visit the family's apartment after being unable to reach Eketi-Mulo by phone, but Schools Week reports they could not gain entry to the block of flats where Chadrack and his mother lived.
