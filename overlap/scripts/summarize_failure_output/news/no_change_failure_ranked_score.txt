Original Story:  – Quick, rattle off as many of the "battleground states" as you can. Points for Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, Nevada, Wisconsin, Iowa, and New Hampshire. Partial credit for Pennsylvania, where Mitt Romney is still hoping for an upset, reports AP. And now you have a good idea where President Obama and Romney will be spending the final three days of the campaign—expect them to hit three or four states a day and to change schedules on the fly. Other tidbits: Ohio, Florida: A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll has Obama up by 51-45 in Ohio and by a scant 49-47 in Florida. The latter state is especially important to Romney's chances, so he might take heart in knowing that a Tampa Bay Times poll has way better Florida numbers for him: He's up 51-45 in that one. Themes: The Washington Post sums up how the campaign strategies have crystallized, that it's no longer enough to make it about the other guy. "The challenger seeking to unseat an incumbent must make a case for himself. The incumbent seeking to hold on to his office must convince voters not only that the alternative would be worse but also that he has earned the right to another term." No more: If you just can't take any more politics, you can always do this.
Original Summary:   I'll give partial credit for Pennsylvania since Mitt Romney is still hoping for an upset, according to the AP.)

Original Story:  – President Obama is back in DC after a two-week Hawaii vacation, and one detail of how he spent his 15th day in paradise is grabbing a few headlines: In addition to beach time and a visit to the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (his mother's father is buried there), Obama and his girls visited with Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder on Saturday afternoon. The Washington Post reports that Vedder lives part-time in the state, also likes Chicago sports, and has rubbed shoulders with Obama before: The musician performed at a fundraiser for Obama in Florida in 2012 and managed to get in a birther joke, quipping that the ukulele he was playing had its own "little birth certificate."

Original Story:  – Rupert Murdoch's thoughts on Muslim people made him very unpopular this weekend with JK Rowling and Aziz Ansari, Salon reports: It started when Murdoch responded to the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attacks by tweeting, "Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible." He followed that up with, "Big jihadist danger looming everywhere from Philippines to Africa to Europe to US. Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy." Rowling replied: "I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I'll auto-excommunicate." While conversing with other Twitter users on the topic, she followed that up with, "The Spanish Inquisition was my fault, as is all Christian fundamentalist violence. Oh, and Jim Bakker." And then: "Eight times more Muslims have been killed by so-called Islamic terrorists than non-Muslims." Murdoch changed his tune a bit yesterday, tweeting, "Extraordinary scenes in Paris today, but do not forget the heroic sacrifice of Ahmed Merabet, Muslim police officer whose funeral was today." That prompted a response from Ansari: "Quit back peddling you racist piece of shit." He then took on Murdoch's first tweet: "Rups can we get a step by step guide? How can my 60 year old parents in NC help destroy terrorist groups? Plz advise. Are you responsible for the evil shit all Christians do or just the insane amount of evil you yourself contribute to? @rupertmurdoch is responsible for all pedophilia committed by anyone Catholic. @rupertmurdoch why are you pro-pedophile :( @rupertmurdoch is Christian just like Mark David Chapman who shot John Lennon. Why didn't Rupert stop it? #RupertsFault." As Salon notes, that hashtag took off, with Murdoch being blamed for pretty much everything, including the existence of Panda Express. Also this weekend, a Fox News pundit claimed that the UK's second-biggest city is "Muslim-only."
Original Summary:  Rupert Murdoch sparked controversy on Twitter by blaming Muslims for the growing "jihadist cancer" and suggesting they must be held responsible for terrorist attacks. JK Rowling and Aziz Ansari were among those who criticized him, with Rowling suggesting that Christians should take responsibility for past violence and Ansari accusing Murdoch of being a "racist piece of shit." Murdoch later backtracked on his comments, tweeting about the heroic sacrifice of a Muslim police officer who was killed in the Paris attacks. Ansari continued to criticize Murdoch, asking for a step-by-step guide on how to destroy terrorist groups and suggesting that Murdoch was responsible for the evil actions of all Christians. The hashtag #RupertMurdochIsResponsibleForEverything trended on Twitter, with many users blaming Murdoch for various problems, including the existence of Panda Express.

Original Story:  – The frosty relations between the White House and Fox News have played out on two consecutive days via testy exchanges between Jay Carney and Fox correspondent Ed Henry, reports the Huffington Post. Today, when Henry pressed Carney on why the White House hasn't presented a debt plan to the CBO, Carney responded, "I know you're creating a thing here for Fox." Henry—who recently left CNN—responded, "That's not what I'm doing. And you know better than that." Yesterday, Carney accused Henry of parroting a GOP "talking point" when the correspondent asked why the Obama plan hadn't been made public. The Atlantic and Politico have more context on the exchanges, and Tommy Christopher at Mediaite offers perspective on Henry: "For those who have gotten the idea that Ed Henry has suddenly turned into a bulldog because he went to Fox, you haven’t been paying attention. Ed has always had a tough, persistent style that’s masked by his amiable persona. ... What has changed, it seems, is Carney’s attitude toward him." Click for more.

Original Story:  – The Libyan war may not be over after all; fighters loyal to the old regime seized the town of Bani Walid yesterday, hoisting the green flag of Moammar Gadhafi's Libya after an eight-hour battle with the revolutionary brigade that had been holding the city. "They control the town now. They are roaming the town," one fighter from that brigade tells Reuters. The Libyan air force says it's mobilizing war planes to head to the city, and the military council says ground troops are on stand-by. When news of the attack broke, coordinated drive-by shootings broke out in Benghazi and Tripoli, according to an AP reporter who was in the Benghazi operations room at the time. Bani Walid is just 90 miles from Tripoli, and was one of the last towns to fall to rebels in the first place. The head of the city's military council says the rebel "May 28 Brigade" only ever had superficial control of the city—"99% of Bani Walid people are Gadhafi loyalists."

After his show was criticized by a (female) music editor, Green on Friday tweeted: "I'm guessing you're gay? And my masculinity offended you? Well, f*** you!" He explained his misstep over the weekend to Us Weekly: "I was being a little outspoken that night, a little outrageous. I always expect people to assume that everything I do is part of my character and sense of humor. I assumed that whoever it was would assume it was all in good fun. It wasn't taken so well, apparently." Despite the comments, Green insists he is not anti-gay: "I'm one of the most liberal artists that I think you will ever meet. If I could take it all back, I would. I was not being serious. I just wanted to defend our performance."

Original Story:  – CNN was widely criticized for hiring a former Trump campaign manager as a commentator back in June. So you can imagine the reaction now that it appears the network may have actually hired a current Trump strategy consultant. The Washington Post reports FEC filings from the Trump campaign show Corey Lewandowski was paid $20,000 by the campaign in August for "strategy consulting." It was the second monthly payment Lewandowski received from the Trump campaign since being fired in June, according to the New York Times. CNN described the first payment as "severance." The Trump campaign claims this second payment was also severance. But it didn't respond when asked why both payments are listed as consulting instead. CNN and Lewandowski refused to comment. The Trump campaign says Lewandowski will continue to receive severance payments through the end of the year. If Lewandowski is indeed still a paid consultant for Trump, it would represent a conflict of interest typically seen as unethical in journalism. Mediaite reports Lewandowski was pulled from a scheduled appearance on CNN's New Day on Wednesday after news of the most recent payment broke. It also originally reported he had been suspended by CNN, but the network denies it.

Original Story:  – Bobby Jindal has dinged Hillary Clinton over her use of private email while in office, but he appears less than eager to release his own work-related correspondence, the Advocate reports. When the newspaper asked for access to the emails, the Louisiana governor's team said that the documents were protected by exemptions in public-records rules. "Aside from the obvious reason for excluding security information, these content-based exemptions support the environment of open discussion and full analysis necessary for staff to make recommendations to assist the governor in the usual course of the duties and business of his office," wrote Jindal's top lawyer. The AP, which also sought emails from Jindal's office, got a similar response from lawyer Thomas Enright. "Aside from email communications with internal staff and emails with family, friends, and personal business, Governor Jindal discusses, debates, and resolves issues relating to official duties either face-to-face or on the telephone," he said. Jindal, who called for a transparent government in his first gubernatorial campaign, supported a law that included protecting communications tied to the "deliberative process." Fair enough, a transparency advocate tells the Advocate: "What is out of line is how [the law has] been interpreted." Proposed legislation could, however, rid the law of the exemptions.

Original Story:  – USA Today applauded Occupy Wall Street for attacking firms that give “huge bonuses” to execs who makes terrible decisions. The paper’s right—but it’s being hypocritical. Gannett, owner of USA Today, is a champion of “bonus excess despite miserable operations,” David Carr writes in the New York Times. Gannett's recently-resigned CEO Craig Dubow oversaw the loss of 20,000 employees, and "strip-mined its newspapers in search of earnings"—yet he departed, because of health problems, not performance issues, with some $37 million in benefits. And Gannett’s hardly alone among media firms “where the consequences of bad decisions land on everyone except those who made them,” Carr notes. Some 4,000 people lost jobs at the Tribune Company, which is now exiting bankruptcy in a deal that pays tens of millions in bonuses. With newspapers struggling, “the people in the industry who are content to slide people out of the back of the truck until it runs out of gas not only don’t deserve tens of millions in bonuses, they don’t deserve jobs,” Carr writes. “Forget about occupying Wall Street; maybe it’s time to start occupying Main Street.” Click through for Carr’s full column.

Gannett's recently resigned CEO, Craig Dubow, oversaw the loss of 20,000 employees and "strip-mined" newspapers for profits before departing with $37 million in benefits. The Tribune Company, which filed for bankruptcy, will pay tens of millions in bonuses to employees as it exits bankruptcy. Many in the media industry are criticizing the practice of awarding large bonuses to executives who are responsible for the industry's struggles. The author suggests that those who are content with laying off employees and awarding large bonuses do not deserve their jobs or bonuses.

The author suggests that those who are content with laying off employees and awarding large bonuses do not deserve their jobs or bonuses.

Original Story:  – As Elon Musk toils away on linking human brains to computers, he apparently has Amber Heard by his side to bounce ideas off of. The 45-year-old Tesla and SpaceX CEO was spotted with the 31-year-old actress, formerly married to Johnny Depp, taking a stroll in Australia's Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary—their "first public outing," People reports. Their weekend of togetherness included plenty of PDA, from their "arm-in-arm" walk and hand clasping at the sanctuary to an Instagram photo Heard posted Sunday night showing her leaning on Musk, a giant lipstick mark on his cheek, above her caption: "Cheeky." Gizmodo, which notes Musk put up a similar picture, notes that while the pair's romancing may only be "Instagram-official," there's a more important question we should be pondering: Will they die on Mars together?

Original Story:  – Cult leader and convicted killer Dan Lafferty didn't just develop a relationship with Utah couple Benjamin and Kristi Strack, found dead in September along with their three children. Lafferty—whose philosophy states the world is run by the devil and the apocalypse is imminent—says his ideology influenced their murder-suicide. Lafferty says their relationship began a decade ago after Kristi Strack read Jon Krakauer's book Under the Banner of Heaven, which describes Lafferty's 1984 killings of his sister-in-law and her 15-month old daughter. Lafferty tells the AP she began sending him letters, then visiting him in prison. He says they fell in love. "My 'insanity' messes with people's lives," Lafferty says from prison, where he's serving a life sentence. "It's just the way it is." At one point, she visited Lafferty on a weekly basis—once giving him a photo of herself in her pajamas, he says—and the pair spent hours on the phone. Lafferty cut off his long hair and beard and mailed them to her. Benjamin Strack visited, too, and wasn't bothered by Lafferty's relationship with his wife, the AP reports. However, the meetings stopped in 2008 when the Stracks pleaded guilty to forgery and drug possession and lost visiting privileges. Lafferty, who says he is the prophet Elijah, tasked with readying the world for the second coming, adds the friendship ended for good because Strack doubted those claims. "I'll miss them, but I'm happy for them," says Lafferty, who hadn't spoken to the family in years. "I believe they're in paradise now."

Original Story:  – There is "divine reason" behind creation and humanity, said Pope Benedict XVI in his Easter Vigil homily yesterday. "Are irrationality, lack of freedom, and pure chance the origin of everything, or are reason, freedom, and love at the origin of being?" he asked. "If man were merely a random product of evolution in some place on the margins of the universe, then his life would make no sense or might even be a chance of nature. But no, reason is there at the beginning: creative, divine reason. " The 84-year-old Benedict coughed several times and his voice sounded sore, according to the AP report of the three-hour service, the most important liturgy on the Catholic church's calendar. The liturgical service was provided by students from the Legion of Christ, a conservative order being restructured after its was found last year to be embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal. You can check out Benedict's homily in its entirety here.
Original Summary:  Pope Benedict XVI delivered an Easter Vigil homily in which he questioned the origins of humanity and the role of reason in creation. He suggested that reason, freedom, and love are the source of being, rather than randomness and chance.

The service was led by students from the Legion of Christ, a conservative order that has been embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal. The full text of the homily is available online.

Original Story:  – Dwynwen Davies didn't think much of the fact that a child in the nursery she runs had come down with slapped cheek syndrome. The virus produces cold-like symptoms and a rash that gives the appearance of "slapped cheeks," but the 30-year-old from South Wales was unconcerned; as the BBC reports, the virus typically has a "minor" effect on children. She did, however, mention it at her 12-week checkup to her midwife, who also didn't seem worried—but ordered a blood test to make sure Davies had immunity to the syndrome. She didn't, meaning the twins she was carrying could be stricken with the virus, which can have a severe effect on fetuses. She was told an affected fetus will fight the infection or fill with fluid that it ultimately chokes on. Five weeks later, that fluid was spotted in one of her girls, reports the Telegraph. At week 20, Davies learned the afflicted twin wasn't showing the fluid; but four weeks later, the baby was in critical condition. Davies was told a blood transfusion could save the unborn child—but it could kill the other, and there was no guarantee it would work. Doctors also couldn't assure her that the virus wouldn't also attack the other twin. "To know that there was a child drowning inside of me was horrible," says Davies, but she decided, "I couldn't risk losing both of my girls." At 28 weeks, the child died; seven weeks later, Davies gave birth to the stillborn girl along with daughter Cadi via C-section. "The birth was bittersweet," she says. "It was heartbreaking to see such a perfect baby who would never have a future." Cadi is now 5 months old. (Click to read about a woman who is pregnant with a stranger's twins after a mix-up.)
Original Summary:  Dwynwen Davies, a 30-year-old woman from South Wales, was pregnant with twins when her 12-week checkup revealed that she did not have immunity to slapped cheek syndrome, a virus that can have a severe effect on fetuses. Despite the risk, doctors decided to perform a blood transfusion on one of the twins to save the unborn child, but there was no guarantee it would work and there was a risk of killing the other twin. The child ultimately died at 28 weeks, and Davies gave birth to the stillborn girl seven weeks later. The surviving twin, Cadi, is now 5 months old. The experience has left Davies feeling heartbroken, but she is grateful for the time she had with her daughter.

Original Story:  – With South Carolina taking down the confederate flag and NASCAR banning it, Kid Rock chose to defend his own use of the Old South emblem: In his words, protesters can "kiss my ass." The rocker was reacting to people who opposed his display at the Detroit Historical Museum, which included the Confederate Flag but may not anymore, Rolling Stone reports. Rock sent a statement to Megyn Kelly at Fox News, saying, "Please tell the people who are protesting to kiss my ass/Ask me some questions." Kelly quoted it in a video available on her Facebook page, editing his words to read, "kiss my ... ask me some questions," she says. "I modified that." Raised in Michigan, Rock lives on an estate in Alabama and uses the Confederate flag "to highlight his Rebel Soul, the name of his 2012 album," Rolling Stone says. He has also toured with Lynyrd Skynyrd, a southern band that often used the Confederate flag. But Rock isn't using the flag on his current tour. While Rock says he hasn't raised the flag to symbolize hate, a reverend at Michigan Chapter of the National Action Network tells MLive.com that if the flag stays up, the museum is "consenting to this attitude and this promotion of the flag that we feel is a hate symbol." For its part, the museum says that "there are no displays of Confederate Flag in the Kid Rock Music Lab or anywhere else inside the Detroit Historical Museum."

Original Story:  – "No, I'm not going to run again." So declared Hillary Clinton this week in an interview with BBC Radio. Clinton, however, said she planned to remain in the public eye criticizing President Trump, reports CNBC. One thing that seems clear: Given her re-emergence on the national stage, lots of people think she will, in fact, run for president in 2020—and lots of Democrats are conflicted about that. Details and developments: Pro-Hillary: A Politico piece headlined "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Hillary?" talks to some of those conflicted Democrats. But it also quotes from Clinton adviser Philippe Reines, who argues that no other Democrat even comes close to her base of support. "Chalking the loss up to her being a failed candidate is an oversimplification," he says. "She is smarter than most, tougher than most, she could raise money easier than most, and it was an absolute fight to the death." He thinks it's unlikely, but possible, that she will run. The chances are "not zero." Anti-Hillary: A good example of the "please, no" camp is a piece by Liz Mair in the Daily Beast, who likens Clinton to a zombie who won't stay down. "Hillary remains caught up in the delusion that the only reason she lost in 2016 was because of Russian interference," writes Mair. "She does not seem to have fully processed the fact that she lost the Electoral College, the only vote that counts."
Original Summary:  Hillary Clinton has stated that she will not run for president again in 2020, but many Democrats are conflicted about this decision. Clinton adviser Philippe Reines believes that she is still a strong candidate and could potentially run, despite her loss in 2016. However, others, such as Liz Mair, are against the idea of Clinton running again, likening her to a zombie who refuses to stay down. Clinton has been critical of President Trump and remains a prominent figure in the public eye, leading some to speculate about her future political ambitions. Despite her denials, the possibility of Clinton running in 2020 remains a topic of discussion and speculation.

Moore is calling it his "October surprise," Fox News reports. The film is apparently a one-man play Moore had planned to perform and record for release in Ohio until being "banned" by the Midland Theatre in Newark. He claims he was shut down for being too controversial; the theater says the timing didn't work out, among other factors. "See the film Ohio Republicans tried to shut down," the Hollywood Reporter quotes a synopsis of the film. "Moore dives right into hostile territory with his daring and hilarious one-man show, deep in the heart of TrumpLand in the weeks before the 2016 election." Michael Moore in TrumpLand starts its theatrical run at the IFC Center on Wednesday. It will also run for a week at a theater in Los Angeles and will be available on iTunes, the AV Club reports. “If you don't live in the NY area, your time for my ‘October Surprise’ is coming very soon," Fox News quotes Moore as saying. As recently as July, Moore was convinced Trump would win the election.

Original Story:  – With a fireplace and a deck overlooking the bay, the home on Hermosa Beach Road was a desirable rental—so much so that a man who didn't even own the Marysville, Wash., home rented it out. KIRO 7 reports 35-year-old Matthew Robert Paul (or "Ryan," as the Daily Herald says he was known to the renters he allegedly swindled) is facing charges of theft and obtaining a signature by deception. Police allege Paul broke into the home in April 2017 after finding out the owners were away for a lengthy vacation. After telling neighbors he was a family friend who was housesitting, Paul fired up the fireplace and put up pictures of himself around the home, and when interested parties responded to his rental ad, he tried to make it look more legit by checking references, per charging papers. Police say he told two men their applications had been accepted; they in turn paid him more than $5,000 for upfront rent, security deposits, and remodeling costs. Paul allegedly told potential renters to make out all checks to his "uncle," a man police say cashed the checks in exchange for $20 worth of heroin from Paul. When the owners finally arrived home, nearly $2,000 worth of their stuff was gone, including their laptops, TV, and various tools; there was also damage to the property. "Using somebody's house is dirt-baggish to begin with," the son of the owners tells KIRO 7, noting he thinks Paul gained access to the house by finding a spare key. "Going the extra mile and trying to gain from it? It's really crazy." Paul, who has pleaded not guilty, is set to appear in court April 19. (A Bay Area man was accused of breaking into homes during his shift as a FedEx worker.)

Original Story:  – In a plan that sounds more like a rejected movie script than reality, Angelina Jolie offered to help capture bloodthirsty warlord Joseph Kony by inviting him to dinner, according to leaked emails. In International Criminal Court emails leaked to the French website Mediapart, former chief ICC posecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said Jolie had offered to embed herself with American troops hunting Kony in the Central African Republic and help lure the Ugandan guerrilla army leader out of hiding, the Times of London reports. "Forget other celebrities, she is the one," Moreno Ocampo wrote in one email in 2012. "She loves to arrest Kony. She is ready. Probably Brad will go also." "Apparently you can be embedded with the special forces that are chasing Kony. Can Brad go with you?" Moreno Ocampo wrote in an email to Jolie, per the Times. She replied: "Brad is being supportive. Let's discuss logistics. Much love Xxx." There are no other references to the plan in the 40,000 leaked emails, and Jolie has declined to comment. Moreno Ocampo served as the ICC's top prosecutor from 2003 to 2012 and the leaked emails suggest he was starstruck by celebrities, especially Jolie, People reports. They discussed several issues over the years, but she stopped replying to his emails toward the end of his time at the ICC. He got no response to an email saying: "Dear Angie, I hope you are well.

Original Story:  – Bombing suspect Ahmad Rahami was taken into custody after a shootout Monday—and Donald Trump is not happy about the standard of care he believes the 28-year-old Afghan immigrant is receiving. "Now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world," Trump told a rally in Florida, per ABC News. "He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he'll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer." Trump called for the use of "whatever lawful methods are available" to get information from the suspect. Trump called for "speedy, but fair trials" and "a just but very harsh punishment." He lamented that Rahami's case will probably be tied up in the courts for years—and "his punishment will not be what it once would have been." Mediaite reports that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in response to Trump's remarks, said that protecting America means protecting rights. "Welcome to America. We have a system of jurisprudence," he said. "You're innocent until proven guilty. You have a right to counsel. And you have the right to hospitalization if you're ill." Hillary Clinton slammed Trump's "irresponsible, reckless rhetoric" and said his response to the bombings was "demagogic," CNN reports.

Original Story:  – Newly confirmed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson managed to cause controversy in his very first speech to HUD employees by describing slaves as "immigrants." His remarks on slavery came after he discussed photos of impoverished immigrants arriving at Ellis Island, the New York Times reports. "That's what America is about, a land of dreams and opportunity," Carson said. "There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less. But they, too, had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land." Carson's speech got a standing ovation from HUD employees, but his remarks were swiftly condemned online, reports Reuters. The NAACP tweeted simply: "Immigrants???" and Whoopi Goldberg tweeted that Carson should watch Roots. The Anne Frank Center called the remarks "as offensive as it gets," while Samuel L. Jackon tweeted: "OK!! Ben Carson....I can't! Immigrants? In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!! MUTHAF---A PLEASE!!!" In a statement, HUD said nobody in the room believed Carson "equates voluntary immigration with involuntary servitude," USA Today reports. In a series of tweets, Carson said you can be an "involuntary immigrant," adding: "Slaves didn't just give up and die, our ancestors made something of themselves."

Original Story:  – Politico calls it President Obama's "Plan B," while the Huffington Post see it as the start of a "charm offensive." Whatever the name, it begins tonight as Obama hosts eight Republican senators at a dinner at a posh hotel near the White House. (John McCain is the most familiar name of the bunch.) It continues next week as Obama heads to Capitol Hill to visit the weekly meetings of both House and Senate Republicans. The president is said to be pursuing the elusive "grand bargain" of a long-term budget deal now that the immediate deadline related to the sequester has come and gone. Obama's $4 trillion plan reportedly includes $600 billion in new tax revenue. The shift from lashing out at Republicans to wooing them comes as polls suggest that the public is getting weary of Obama's "post-election bellicosity," says Politico. And pursuing a big-picture deal seems possible now that it appears Congress will avoid the next potential crisis—the potential shutdown of the government on March 27, reports the Washington Post. The House today passed a bill to fund the government for the full fiscal year, keeping the sequester cuts in place but giving the Pentagon more flexibility on how to manage its defense cuts. The Senate is expected to follow suit before the deadline arrives, with Democrats trying to give the same leeway to domestic programs.

Original Story:  – Chrissie Hynde is promoting her new memoir, Reckless, and what she has to say about a sexual assault she suffered when she was 21 has provoked a mixture of outrage and pity. The Pretenders singer tells the Sunday Times that she takes "full responsibility" for being brought to an abandoned house and forced to perform sexual acts on members of an Ohio biker gang after being told she was being taken to a party. If I'm "very modestly dressed and I'm keeping to myself, and someone attacks me, then I'd say that's his fault," she says. "But if I'm being very lairy and putting it about and being provocative, then you are enticing someone who's already unhinged—don't do that," she says, adding that if "you don't want to entice a rapist, don't wear high heels so you can't run from him." Groups including the charity Victim Support strongly criticized the remarks, stressing that victims—including Hynde—should never blame themselves, the BBC reports. "It's incredibly common for victims of sexual assault to blame themselves or find some sort of excuse for why it happened," the founder of SlutWalk DC tells the Washington Post. "We've been entrenched with these ideas that if you behave in a certain manner or you dress in a certain way that you are able to reduce your chance of getting victimized and that's just completely untrue," she says, describing rape and sexual assault as "a crime of power, not a crime of sexual attraction or sexual desire." The Guardian's Hadley Freeman tweeted: "Many people seem furious with Chrissie Hynde, and I get why, but I feel pity for her. Imagine blaming y/self for sthg so awful for so long." (Ozy makes the argument that there's a rape problem you're not hearing about.)

Many have criticized Hynde's remarks, with groups such as Victim Support and SlutWalk DC stressing that victims should never blame themselves for sexual assault. The issue of rape and sexual assault is complex, with many arguing that it is a crime of power, not sexual attraction or desire.

Simpson is on the president's deficit commission, which is looking into potential Social Security cuts, and liberal critics now want him off the panel, notes the Huffington Post. The email proves him to be sexist with "disdain for the very program he claims he is trying to protect—Social Security," says the co-director of Social Security Works. HuffPo has a PDF of Simpson's full letter here. "If you have some better suggestions about how to stabilize Social Security instead of just babbling into the vapors, let me know," he writes at one point. "Call when you get honest work!"

Original Story:  – First Starbucks, now Walmart is awash in complaints about its bottled water operation in Sacramento, which has been hard-hit by conservation measures amid California's drought. CBS13 reports the company's Great Value brand water comes from the Sacramento Municipal Water Supply and is sold to bottler DS Services of America at 99 cents per 748 gallons before it lands on Walmart's shelves with a price tag of 88 cents per gallon, earning the two companies $658.24 for those 748 gallons. Walmart tells the Guardian it is "very concerned" about the drought, but "our commitment to sustainability includes efforts to minimize water use in our facilities. We continue to work with our suppliers to act responsibly while meeting the needs of customers." Still, the transaction is "certainly leaving a bad taste in everyone's mouth," a PR expert says. "You can't water your lawn if you're living in this region. And to find out they're making a huge profit off of this, it's just not right." Though the US Geological Survey notes the bottling industry uses less than 1% of state water, some say the plants aren't properly monitored. "The entire state is under a 25% cut, farmers are letting fields go fallow, and we don't have one piece of legislation regulating water bottling," a rep for the Gateway Neighborhood Association tells the San Francisco Chronicle. Residents of Mount Shasta are now campaigning against a planned bottled water plant from Crystal Geyser, which doesn't need to submit an environmental impact report or a permit to tap the area's water. (Former workers are peeved at Walmart, too.)
Original Summary:  Walmart and Starbucks are facing criticism for their bottled water operations in Sacramento, where the drought has led to conservation measures. Walmart buys bottled water from DS Services of America at $0.99 per 748 gallons and sells it to customers at $0.88 per gallon, earning $658.24 per 748 gallons. The company claims to be concerned about the drought but is also working to minimize water use in its facilities. Residents are upset about the profit being made from bottled water during a drought, especially since farmers are letting fields go fallow and not getting enough water. A planned bottled water plant in Mount Shasta is also facing opposition from residents who want more regulation of the industry.

CBS13 reports the company's Great Value brand water comes from the Sacramento Municipal Water Supply and is sold to bottler DS Services of America at 99 cents per 748 gallons before it lands on Walmart's shelves with a price tag of 88 cents per gallon, earning the two companies $658.24 for those 748 gallons. Walmart tells the Guardian it is "very concerned" about the drought, but "our commitment to sustainability includes efforts to minimize water use in our facilities. We continue to work with our suppliers to act responsibly while meeting the needs of customers." Still, the transaction is "certainly leaving a bad taste in everyone's mouth," a PR expert says. "You can't water your lawn if you're living in this region. And to find out they're making a huge profit off of this, it's just not right." Though the US Geological Survey notes the bottling industry uses less than 1% of state water, some say the plants aren't properly monitored. "The entire state is under a 25% cut, farmers are letting fields go fallow, and we don't have one piece of legislation regulating water bottling," a rep for the Gateway Neighborhood Association tells the San Francisco Chronicle. Residents of Mount Shasta are now campaigning against a planned bottled water plant from Crystal Geyser, which doesn't need to submit an environmental impact report or a permit to tap the area's water. (Former workers are peeved at Walmart, too.)

Original Story:  – The interminable trickle of Mel Gibson gossip continues with the latest shocker leaked to Radar: He allegedly threatened to kill Oksana Grigorieva, her two children, and himself. Grigorieva has reportedly told authorities the threats came during the couple's now-infamous Jan. 6 altercation, during which he supposedly punched her twice in the head and choked her as she was holding their daughter. The fight was fueled by Gibson’s jealousy that she was around other men at her son’s basketball game earlier that day, and the 12-year-old was reportedly in his bedroom during the incident—even when Gibson pulled a gun and made his murder-suicide threat. Radar also released another recording from that evening, in which Grigorieva accuses Gibson of hitting their daughter and he says, “No one will believe you.” Wondering where all of Gibson's Christian supporters have gone?

Original Story:  – Russian investigators believe a couple may have killed, skinned, and eaten up to 30 people over the past two decades, even secretly feeding "canned human meat" to unsuspecting soldiers at the military academy where they worked, the Washington Post reports. According to the Moscow Times, a construction worker in the city of Krasnodar found a cellphone Sept. 11 that contained gruesome images: a man taking a selfie with a severed hand in his mouth, severed heads, and dismembered women. Authorities say police traced the phone's SIM card to 35-year-old Dmitry Baksheev, who initially claimed he found the body parts in a dumpster and took pictures with them. He allegedly later confessed that he and his wife had killed and eaten perhaps 30 people, which would put them among Russia's worst serial killers. While many details of the case are unknown or unconfirmed, authorities say the alleged murders date back to at least 1999, CNN reports. That's the time stamp on a photo found in the couple's home that appears to show a severed head and fruit on a serving plate. Authorities say they also found eight body parts preserved in jars with saline solution, the remains of seven people, and a how-to video on cannibalism in the couple's apartment. According to the BBC, "food fragments and frozen meat pieces of unknown origin" found in the apartment are being tested for human DNA. Authorities say Baksheev and his wife, Natalia Baksheeva, would knock their victims out with sedatives, though it's unclear how they chose their victims. So far authorities have only charged Baksheev with a single count of murder.

Original Story:  – In what Deadspin notes was part of a PR tour for his new self-help book, Tom Brady sat down with Norah O'Donnell Sunday on CBS This Morning. But O'Donnell didn't just stick to publishing topics in her conversation with the Patriots quarterback, instead touching on another hot button in the football world. "Colin Kaepernick: Do you think he can play again in the NFL?" O'Donnell asked Brady, per CBS Sports, referencing the now-free agent who many say is being blacklisted by the NFL for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. "I sure hope so," Brady replied. "I've always watched him and admired him, the way that he's played, he was a great young quarterback. He came to our stadium and beat us and took his team to the Super Bowl [in 2013, for the 2012 season]." Per the New York Daily News, Brady had addressed Kaepernick Monday on a Boston radio station, noting his attention is elsewhere at this point in the season, not on Kaepernick nor the national anthem protests. He also said he doesn't know the ex-49er "very well," adding, "I've never really had a conversation with him." Deadspin notes Brady tiptoed around whether or not Kaepernick would ever get a chance to play again for the NFL, but "it's nice to see the acknowledgment that Kaepernick deserves one." "He accomplished a lot in the pros as a player," Brady told O'Donnell. "And he's certainly qualified, and I hope he gets a shot." Meanwhile, Kaepernick won the NFL Players Association's Community MVP award this week for recent charitable donations, which TMZ notes puts him in the running for the Byron Whizzer White Award, the "highest honor that the NFLPA can bestow upon a player."

Original Story:  – He didn't take Nebraska, but Ted Cruz has been dropping hints that he may restart his presidential bid, and news out of Texas leant a bit of momentum to that rumor. "We have a busy weekend planned," a source said to be familiar with Cruz's camp coyly tells Politico, which notes that the senator is due to give a speech at Texas' GOP convention, which starts Thursday in Dallas, and that he has dispatched a paid adviser there as well. The Cruz camp's supposed strategy: to influence Texas, and eight other state conventions happening this week, in picking a total of 389 delegates (about one-fifth of the total) so he can then get people he trusts to dump Trump and perhaps force a contested convention. One thing seemingly putting the kibosh on a reinvigorated run for Cruz, however: papers filed Wednesday—Gawker adds "papers for continued public humiliation"—with the Federal Election Commission and the Senate's Office of Public Letters, Breitbart reports. The letter notes that, as of May 4, "Senator Ted Cruz is no longer a candidate for President of the United States. As of that date, his 2018 campaign for the United States Senate and his campaign committee Ted Cruz for Senate have been reactivated." That official reactivation means his Senate campaign committee can now raise money for a reelection bid, per NBC DFW. Cruz was also asked point-blank at a Wednesday press conference if he planned to vie for Senate again, per CNN, to which he simply responded, "Yes." Cruz was back at Capitol Hill Tuesday, warmly greeted by some with applause and fist bumps, but others, such as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, "were a few steps from Cruz but didn't seem to notice or care he was back," per CNN.

Original Story:  – Michigan Rep. John Conyers confirms that he did indeed pay a settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, though he continues to deny the allegations. "My office resolved the allegations—with an express denial of liability—in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation," said Conyers in a statement, per NPR. "That should not be lost in the narrative." Conyers, who "vehemently" denied the allegations, also promised to cooperate with any congressional investigation that ensues. The statement came hours after the AP reported that the Democratic congressman had denied paying any such settlement. In fact, Conyers told an AP reporter that he learned about the accusations of sexual misconduct when many other people did: Tuesday morning, while watching television. In that interview, he denied BuzzFeed's report that he settled a complaint from a former female staffer in 2015 for $27,000. "I have been looking at these [allegations] in amazement," said the 88-year-old, who is accused in the report of repeatedly making advances on female staffers and firing one for refusing those advances. The Hill reports Paul Ryan earlier called the report "extremely troubling" and noted "additional reforms to the system [for reporting complaints] are under consideration."

Original Story:  – A rare voter fraud suspect has been arrested in Iowa, though Donald Trump is unlikely to accuse her of trying to rig the election: Terri Lynn Rote, who was arrested Thursday on suspicion of voting twice, is a registered Republican, the Des Moines Register reports. Police say the 55-year-old cast two early voting ballots in Polk County, which includes Des Moines. Two other people suspected of voting twice were reported to authorities, but have yet to be arrested. County auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says these are the first cases of alleged voter fraud that he can remember in 12 years. "I think it shows that our voting system works in Iowa, that we're able to catch it," Fitzgerald tells the Register, adding that although tensions are running high before the election, there is still a chance that the double votes could have been mistakes. The Blaze reports that Rote was an early Trump supporter who told a reporter in early February that she was planning to caucus for him in Des Moines. Early voting began in Iowa on Sept. 29. (Rudy Giuliani says "dead people generally vote for Democrats.")
Original Summary:  A 55-year-old woman named Terri Lynn Rote was arrested in Iowa on suspicion of voting twice in the upcoming election.

According to the county auditor, this is the first instance of voter fraud he has seen in 12 years. Despite the arrest, Rote's actions may have been a mistake rather than an intentional attempt to rig the election.

Family members have denied reports that the director had inoperable brain cancer—or any kind of brain tumor, an investigator says. ABC News, citing a source close to the director, was first to report that diagnosis, but it later backtracked. Autopsy results have been deferred while toxicology and other tests are carried out, TMZ reports. "We will look at any medical history," the assistant chief coroner says. "We don’t have anything medically confirmed at this time." Asked whether the suicide note found in Scott's office mentioned any medical issues, the assistant chief coroner replied: "Not to my knowledge." A witness says the Top Gun director appeared nervous before he jumped to his death from a bridge over Los Angeles Harbor. "He was on the roadway close to the fence looking around. He was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet," the witness tells the Los Angeles Times. "I thought it was some extreme-sports guy." Scott, he says, "paused a couple of seconds and then began to climb the fence. He put his foot on the top of the fence and paused again. And then he threw himself off."

Original Story:  – The "Barefoot Bandit" will be released to a halfway house and a work release program soon, possibly as early as this week; his formal release date from prison is Jan. 17. And Colton Harris-Moore, 25, already has a job lined up. His lawyer, John Henry Browne, says Harris-Moore will "be looking for full-time work and will eventually be going to school," but in the meantime, he'll have a part-time job doing clerical work and answering phones at Browne's Seattle office, the Seattle Times reports. Browne says Harris-Moore would ultimately like to be an aeronautical engineer and is being mentored by a Boeing engineer. "He's matured a lot," Browne, who says he had "mixed emotions" upon first offering Harris-Moore a job, tells KOMO. Harris-Moore also has a place to live, and is more "ahead of the game than most released," Browne adds. Browne took on Harris-Moore's defense for just $1, and has said Harris-Moore's drive to improve himself is impressive: "Indeed, Colton, one of my favorite clients today, truly is a triumph," Browne wrote in his recently published autobiography. Harris-Moore became "something of a folk hero," the Times notes; he was a hungry and neglected child when he first turned to a life of crime and was first sent to jail for burglary at age 17. He escaped from a halfway house in 2008 and eluded authorities while committing break-ins and thefts for two years, even stealing boats, cars, and planes. His nickname comes from the sketch of bare footprints he'd leave behind as a signature (and the fact that he was often barefoot while committing his crimes, CNN notes). He was caught in the Bahamas after he flew a stolen plane there. A movie deal will help Harris-Moore repay his victims. (Click for more of the Barefoot Bandit's fascinating story.)

Original Story:  – The specter of a financial crisis came back to haunt Italy on Tuesday, as its markets plunged on fears that the eurozone's third-largest economy is heading toward an election that will be a referendum on whether to stay in the common currency. The Wall Street Journal notes that the crisis is spooking world markets as well, and Business Insider has a primer on what's going on, with this key point: "Perhaps the simplest way to imagine the eurozone is as a three-legged stool," writes Will Martin. "Germany, France and Italy are the legs holding up the rest of the project. Remove any one of those three pillars and the stool falls over." The political situation is convoluted. Premier-designate Carlo Cottarelli was expected to submit his list of ministers to President Sergio Mattarella in Rome, two days after a failed attempt by two populist parties to form a government. Enraged at losing their chance at governing following inconclusive elections in March, both the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-euro League vowed with other parties to vote against a Cottarelli government when it faces a vote of confidence in parliament, expected later this week. That would force Italy to new elections in the fall, with Cottarelli heading an interim, caretaker government, per the AP. "Italy will be wrapped in a long drawn-out period of wrangling that will feature intense anti-establishment and euroskeptic tones," said political analyst Wolfango Piccoli. He said that while it was doubtful that the 5-Stars and League would "embrace a clear euro-exit platform," they can be expected to be more hostile toward the EU. "We should now call this a crisis," said Kit Juckes, an analyst at Societe Generale.

Original Story:  – The former owner of a Russian candy factory has been ordered to remain in jail while the slaying of a plant security guard is under investigation. Investigators said Ilya Averyanov argued with the factory's new owner and opened fire with a hunting rifle on Wednesday, killing the guard and wounding three other people. Averyanov then told a radio station that he had barricaded himself inside the Moscow plant and was defending himself against a "gang" that had colluded with Moscow prosecutors to seize his property, the AP reports. "My plant was seized with the use of fake documents, they have ruined me," Averyanov told the radio station, per the Moscow Times. "I have a service weapon and used it in defense today." Averyanov told a court Thursday he didn't kill anyone and pleaded to be put under house arrest. The court instead ordered him jailed for two months.

Original Story:  – In a major setback for pro-marijuana activists in the first state to legalize the drug for medical use, California's Supreme Court has ruled that cities and towns can legally ban pot dispensaries. In its 7-0 decision, the court sided with more than 200 local governments in the state that ban dispensaries within their borders, saying the bans fall under local governments' authority to regulate the use of land, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Advocates complain that the local bans have resulted in a patchwork of policies that leave many patients who need it most without access to the drug. "It’s a very big hardship for patients who live where they don’t have a dispensary," a Marijuana Policy Project director tells the New York Daily News. "It’s more dangerous to send seriously ill patients to drug dealers to obtain the marijuana they need to treat their illnesses." Activists plan to push for a statewide policy ensuring access to medical marijuana—and a bill legalizing it for recreational purposes.

Original Story:  – NASA says it has weighed President Trump's request to have astronauts on the maiden flight of its huge new rocket—but the price tag is too high. Acting NASA administrator Robert Lightfoot says it would cost up to $900 million more to have the Orion capsule crew-ready when it goes into space with NASA's Space Launch System "super rocket," CBS reports. Lightfoot says granting Trump's request would also further delay the first launch, which he says has already been pushed back from late 2018 to some time in 2019. A study found that adding astronauts would be "technically feasible," but "we decided that the baseline plan we had in place was the best plan," Lightfoot told reporters Friday. NASA plans to send the rocket beyond the moon, and it says not having astronauts on board will allow them to push it much harder during its three-week maiden flight, reports Popular Mechanics. Lightfoot says the plan is still to have astronauts in an upgraded version of the Orion capsule in a second flight scheduled to take place two years after the first. The Space Launch System is the centerpiece of NASA's plan to have humans on Mars by the 2030s, though critics including Newt Gingrich, who has advised Trump on space issues, believe that with private companies like SpaceX working on reusable rockets, the SLS might be obsolete by the time it launches, the New York Times reports.
Original Summary:  NASA has received President Trump's request to have astronauts on the maiden flight of its new rocket, but has determined that the cost is too high.

A study found that adding astronauts to the mission was technically feasible, but NASA decided to stick with its original plan to launch without crew members. The agency plans to send the rocket beyond the moon without astronauts on board to allow it to reach its full potential during the three-week mission.

Original Story:  – It appears Hillary Clinton blames Sen. Bernie Sanders, at least partly, for her surprising loss to President Trump in the 2016 election. "His attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump's 'Crooked Hillary' campaign,'" CNN quotes a leaked excerpt from Clinton's upcoming book, What Happened. Excerpts from the book, which is set to be released Sept. 12, were posted online by a pro-Clinton Twitter account and by a user on a Clinton-affiliated Facebook page. CNN states the excerpts on Sanders are "remarkably candid" for Clinton. Clinton blames Sanders for resorting "to innuendo and impugning my character" in the face of their policy similarities and says his "Bernie Bros" harassed her supporters: "It got ugly and more than a little sexist." Vox reports Clinton also takes issue with what she says were unrealistic policies from Sanders—essentially promising everyone in America a pony. "His plans didn't add up," the Hill quotes Clinton as saying in the excerpts. She says some of his policies "were little more than a pipe-dream." Clinton says she wanted to hit back at Sanders during the primary but was warned against it. She says Obama told her to "grit my teeth and lay off Bernie as much as I could." Experts worry Clinton putting blame on Sanders could deepen the current rifts in the Democratic party.

Original Story:  – Pero Jelinic's love of big game hunting took him all over the world, but most recently to South Africa, where he hoped to bring down a lion. It was to be the "crown" of the Croatian's trophy hall, filled with "everything that could be hunted in Croatia and Europe," his friend, Slavko Pernar, told reporters, per Yahoo. But though Jelinic apparently managed to nab that crown, it was only shortly before Pernar says he met "the ugliest end." The details are murky, but police say 75-year-old Jelinic was fatally shot Saturday while hunting with two friends at Leeuwbosch Game Lodge, where lions are bred in captivity some 40 miles from the Botswana border. The group had killed one lion and was tracking a second when Jelinic was hit by a bullet and died after being airlifted to a hospital, reports the BBC. Police aren't sure who fired the fatal shot and while they don't suspect foul play, they've opened a culpable homicide (manslaughter) investigation and are considering charges of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, reports the Week. One of the men present maintains the guns were legal, however, and describes the shooting as an accident that came after "a series of unfortunate circumstances," per the Mirror. According to one account, a tired Jelinic handed his guns to other hunters in his party before he was accidentally shot in the shoulder, per Total Croatia News. A separate account suggests Jelinic was shot while aiming at a lion. Either way, Pernar says Jelinic—a hotel owner who leased the building to fund his retirement and hunting trips—died "doing what he loved."

"This is the most hypocritical, clueless statement in her regrettable time in the WH," wrote conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin, calling the first daughter "part of the problem."

Meanwhile, Alyssa Milano helpfully supplied a link for Ivanka Trump to make "a lofty donation to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund that is available to support your father's accusers."
Injected Summary:  Ivanka Trump praised Oprah Winfrey's Golden Globes speech, but faced backlash for her own tweet. Trump's tweet received 10,000 likes and 16,000 negative replies, including middle-finger emojis and criticism from conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin. Rubin called Trump "part of the problem" and suggested she make a donation to the Times Up Legal Defense Fund to support Winfrey's accusers. Alyssa Milano also offered to provide Trump with a link to the fund. Despite the backlash, Trump's tweet was seen as an attempt to distance herself from her father, President Donald Trump, who has faced numerous sexual misconduct allegations.

Original Story:  – A grisly mystery in London has police searching for answers. The Independent reports a 70-year-old man named John Nolan was walking near his home Sept. 17 when he burst into flames. Emergency services were called for a "man ablaze" while bystanders tried to put out the fire. The retired construction worker later died at the hospital from "horrific" burns, according to the Telegraph. His relatives say even his internal organs had burned. Despite months of investigation, officials have found no source of ignition or sign of an accelerant and have no suspects. Police say that interviews with witnesses don't indicate Nolan "had been in contact with another person at the time of the fire." The Telegraph raises the specter of spontaneous human combustion, which it says is "a fiercely debated process" with only 200 deaths ever attributed to it. Bernard Knight, a former pathologist, says it's "ridiculous" to give any credence to spontaneous human combustion. “In the course of my career I saw maybe three or four cases of so-called spontaneous combustion, but they were all indoors near an open fireplace," he says. In the case of Nolan, he says "a failure to find a cause does not mean there isn't one." Meanwhile, Nolan's family just wants answers. “We were just worried that a frail, elderly man was attacked on the street,” nephew Kevin Byrne tells the Journal. “We just don’t know what happened to him and we’d like to know."
Original Summary:  A 70-year-old man named John Nolan burst into flames while walking near his home in London on September 17, despite there being no apparent source of ignition or sign of an accelerant. He later died from severe burns at the hospital, with his internal organs also affected. Despite months of investigation, police have found no leads or suspects, and witnesses report that Nolan was alone at the time of the incident. The case has raised the possibility of spontaneous human combustion, a rare and controversial phenomenon in which a person suddenly catches fire with no apparent cause. However, some experts, including a former pathologist, have expressed skepticism about this theory, suggesting that there may be a more logical explanation for the incident.

Original Story:  – A Florida man who smothered his elderly father to death is going to a state hospital instead of a state prison. A judge declared that Stephen Coffeen "did not understand the wrongfulness of his actions" and found him not guilty by reason of insanity today, reports the St. Petersburg Times. What normally would have been a local case drew national attention when an expert noted in court that Coffeen had been guzzling Red Bull before the killing, notes ABC. The "Red Bull defense" became an instant headline hit. "This case is not and never has been about Red Bull," said the judge. Four experts who testified at the non-jury hearing agreed that the 41-year-old could not differentiate right from wrong. Coffeen's brother is upset with the verdict, saying Coffeen intended to kill their father all along. "He got away with murder," he says. "Let 12 Floridians make the decision, not four 'experts.'"
Original Summary:  A Florida man, Stephen Coffeen, has been found not guilty by reason of insanity in the death of his elderly father after being declared unfit to stand trial. Coffeen had been drinking Red Bull before the killing, which led to the "Red Bull defense" becoming a national headline. Four experts testified that Coffeen could not differentiate right from wrong, leading the judge to rule in favor of the insanity plea. Coffeen's brother is upset with the verdict, believing that his brother intended to kill their father all along. The case has sparked controversy and debate over the use of the insanity defense.

Original Story:  – It took way longer than expected to call, but Virginia Democrat Mark Warner has kept his seat in the Senate. Republican challenger Ed Gillespie conceded the race today, reports Politico. Warner had been expected to easily win re-election, but he managed an advantage of only about 16,000 votes out of 2 million cast, reports the AP. This leaves only the races in Alaska (too close to call) and Louisiana (headed to a runoff) still up in the air. Both seats are currently held by Democrats, meaning Republicans can only build on their new Senate majority. They control 52 seats at the moment.

Original Story:  – A special committee of the FDA voted unanimously to recommend revoking approval of the best-selling cancer drug in the world as a treatment for breast cancer. The panel says Avastin is ineffective in treating breast cancer and unsafe, paving the way for the government to remove its endorsement, reports the Wall Street Journal. FDA chief Margaret Hamburg will make the final decision. "I think we all wanted Avastin to succeed but the reality is that these studies did not bear out that hope," says a patient representative on the panel. Following the vote, patients in the audience began shouting angrily at the committee. "What do you want us to take?" yelled one woman. "We have nothing else!" If the FDA continues with its withdrawal, drugmaker Roche could lose up to $1 billion in revenue from its top product, notes Reuters. Avastin is approved to treat other cancers, and that would not change no matter what Hamburg decides.

Original Story:  – Shoppers, beware: Your nose could trick you into spending more than you'd planned to. That's according to a new study, which finds that fragrances linked to a feeling of warmth—cinnamon, for instance—can lead us to buy fancier items, Medical Daily reports. It's a little complicated: Warm fragrances, it seems, make people "feel that the room they are in is more crowded, and feel less powerful as a result," the authors write in the study, published in the journal Marketing. They make up for that powerlessness with an "increased preference for and purchase of premium products and brands." Researchers also found that subjects in a "warm"-smelling room bought a higher number of total products, the Daily Mail reports. Medical Daily suggests that the phenomenon could be linked to the idea of retail therapy: When we're feeling down on ourselves, shopping provides a lift. The Mail has another odd tip for marketers: Price things in round numbers if you want customers to buy based on their emotions. "A rounded price—$100—encourages consumers to rely on feelings when evaluating products, while a non-rounded price—$98.76—encourages consumers to rely on reason," experts found in another study. (One way to dodge scented marketing: suffer from an 18-year-long stuffy nose.)
Original Summary:  Shoppers may be unknowingly influenced by fragrances in stores, as research suggests that warm scents can lead to increased spending on premium products. The study found that warm fragrances make people feel less powerful and lead to a preference for higher-priced items. Subjects in a warm-smelling room also purchased more products overall. The phenomenon may be linked to the idea of retail therapy, as people seek to boost their mood through shopping. Marketers may use rounded pricing to encourage customers to make purchases based on emotions rather than reason.

Original Story:  – For the first time in seven years, Hannah Overton will be able to hug her five kids instead of waving to them through plexiglass. The Corpus Christi mother, who has been in prison since 2007, was released on $50,000 bond yesterday, more than two months after a Texas appellate court threw out her life sentence for the murder of 4-year-old foster son Andrew Burd and ordered a new trial, ABC News reports. The appellate court said the performance of her original defense team "fell below a reasonable standard," the Huffington Post reports. Overton was convicted of poisoning Andrew in 2006 with seasoning, with prosecutors painting her as an out-of-control mom who "forced him to have 23 teaspoons of hot pepper and then watched him die in agony." Overton's defense team contended that Andrew may have wandered into the kitchen pantry and accidentally ingested the seasoning himself. Overton had been convicted based on not getting timely help for Andrew. But Overton and her husband had taken Andrew to an urgent-care clinic, and a salt intoxication expert whose testimony wasn't used in the original trial said poisoning symptoms initially are mild and wouldn't have roused suspicion right away, the Guardian reports. Several witnesses testified to Overton's character at yesterday's hearing, KRIS TV notes, including a pastor who said Overton went on mission trips to help kids in Mexico, and a man who said Overton had been "the best caregiver he ever had" for his disabled son. As Overton awaits a new trial, she's just happy to spend time with her family. "I know we'll make up for it, but I don't know what we'll be able to catch up for seven years," Overton tells ABC. (A New York mom says her 5-year-old son may have accidentally poisoned himself and died.)
Original Summary:  Hannah Overton, a mother of five, was released from prison after serving seven years of a life sentence for the murder of her 4-year-old foster son, Andrew Burd.

Overton's new defense team argues that Andrew may have accidentally ingested the seasoning while wandering in the kitchen.

Original Story:  – You might want to do anything to get rid of bedbugs, but adding fire to the mix didn't end well for one Cincinnati woman trying to rid her apartment of the tiny creeps. As the AP reports, she accidentally started a house fire while trying to kill bedbugs with rubbing alcohol on Friday, causing $250,000 in damage and hospitalizing three people with smoke inhalation. Ten people are now homeless. "When I got here the whole house was on fire," one resident tells Fox 19. "I'll start from scratch. It's like a dream....everything is burnt. I'll start fresh. It's all we can do now." It's worth noting that the fire isn't as much a fluke as one might think: Two weeks ago, a 13-year-old Cincinnati boy set fire to his building in the course of trying to kill bedbugs with alcohol; eight were left homeless in that blaze. Says a Cincy fire chief of proper bedbug removal: "Get a professional."

Original Story:  – It's not the Brooklyn Bridge, but authorities in Alabama do have a nuclear power plant they want to sell you. Minimum bids for the never-finished Bellefonte nuke plant start at $36.4 million, which is essentially the value of the 1,400-acre patch of land on the Tennessee River in Hollywood, Ala., with a couple of reactors thrown in, reports the Times Free Press. That's a fraction of the approximately $5 billion that authorities have spent over nearly a half-century to develop the site, once the state's largest energy project. Work began in 1973 on two nuclear reactors—four were planned—when demand for electric power was growing by 5% a year. But as demand ebbed, the project stalled and, faced with a final price tag of $8 billion, the Tennessee Valley Authority decided to quit while it was behind. Support for nuclear power waned after the 1979 meltdown at Three Mile Island, per the Washington Post. "Selling the property now is a smart business decision," says the TVA. The auction is set for Nov. 14, and bidding has begun; Phoenix Energy in Nevada has already offered $38 million. Hollywood Mayor Frank "Buster" Duke, who worked at the site as a pipe fitter, hopes a buyer will finish the plant—and generate much-needed jobs. "The plant was 90% complete when TVA quit building it, and I know they would have to change and update some things, but I sure hope somebody could operate it to make power," Duke tells the Times Free Press. (The US Army has a secret nuke facility buried beneath the Greenland ice sheet.)

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) decided to abandon the project in 1988, with a final price tag of $8 billion. The plant is located on a 1,400-acre site on the Tennessee River and is now being sold through an auction. A company called Phoenix Energy in Nevada has already bid $38 million for the plant.

Original Story:  – Fox News has issued an apology after airing an interview with a US veteran who, it turns out, was not the hero he claimed to be. Introduced on the network Oct. 8 as a former Navy SEAL who served in Vietnam and earned 22 commendations and two Purple Hearts, John Garofalo has since admitted to the Military Times that he greatly exaggerated his military credentials. Garofalo is indeed a Navy veteran and a glass artist who hopes to gift President Trump with a 4-foot presidential glass seal, the focus of the Fox segment. But he was never a SEAL, he never served in Vietnam, and he didn't earn all those commendations, not even a single Purple Heart. Instead, he did a short overseas tour in Spain during four years of Navy service ending in 1967. "What I did I'm ashamed of, and I didn't mean to cause so much disgrace to the SEALs," says the 72-year-old Garofalo, noting his lies about his service have gotten "bigger and bigger" over the years. Retired SEAL Don Shipley alerted Fox to Garofalo's lies after the interview aired, and the network plans to run an on-air correction in addition to those online. (Its interview with Garofalo had been viewed 1.5 million times on Facebook.) "Unfortunately, all of Garofalo's claims turned out to be untrue," the Fox notice reads. "We apologize to our viewers, especially veterans and servicemen and women."

Introduced on the network Oct. 8 as a former Navy SEAL who served in Vietnam and earned 22 commendations and two Purple Hearts, John Garofalo has since admitted to the Military Times that he greatly exaggerated his military credentials. Garofalo is indeed a Navy veteran and a glass artist who hopes to gift President Trump with a 4-foot presidential glass seal, the focus of the Fox segment.

Original Story:  – As the number of Americans dying of drug overdoses continues to rise—thanks in large part to an opioid epidemic—so too has the number of organ donors. In fact, the percentage of donors who died of overdoses has nearly tripled since 2006, according to data gathered by the United Network for Organ Sharing. If you look back as far as 2000, it's jumped from just 1.1% to 9.3% of all deceased donors. The increase has been "huge," one expert tells US News & World Report. "It's a silver lining to what is absolutely a tragedy." The network estimates that more than 121,000 people are waiting for a life-saving transplant today, while the Guardian reports that 22 people die every day on the wait list. And it's no wonder; in 2015, organs were only recovered from 9,080 deceased donors, with 848 of those donors having died of an overdose. Some have expressed concerns about the quality of tissue donated from a drug addict, and infections such as HIV and hepatitis C have been reported. But the risk of transmitting a virus remains low, and with the other option being death, most patients are willing to take the risk. And behind the numbers are, of course, countless personal stories. As the Daily Union reports in Wisconsin, one mother of a 17-year-old daughter who overdosed on heroin in 2012 grieved in a message she wrote waiting for the organ donation team to arrive: "How did we get here, Peanut? I never thought I would be giving pieces of you away. It all feels like a dream, little girl." (Watch this mother listen to the heart of her dead son beat inside a 4-year-old girl.)

Original Story:  – It was "the Titanic of its time." A luxury steamboat carrying some of the wealthiest and most high-profile families in the Southeast exploded while traveling from Savannah, Ga., to Baltimore, Md. on June 13, 1838. Half of the roughly 200 people aboard the Pulaski died—including whole families and a US congressman from New York, reports the Charlotte Observer. Divers now believe they've found the 180-year-old wreck site, says Keith Webb of Blue Water Ventures. It's partnering with Endurance Exploration—which the Tampa Bay Business Journal reports is also trying to search for a wreck in the Indian Ocean—and says the Pulaski lies beneath 115 feet of water 40 miles off the coast of North Carolina. There's not a trace of wood left. But a 30-foot by 60-foot debris pile includes two copper boilers, one blown apart, the other split. That’s just how survivors described the state of the Pulaski's boilers after the explosion, which reportedly caused the boat to sink in 45 minutes, Webb says. "In my mind, there is no doubt this is the wreck of the Pulaski." In addition to Spanish and US silver coins dated before the Pulaski's demise, they've found a straight razor, brass key, candlestick holder, and turkey platter. As "it's one of the more significant disasters in American maritime history," Joseph Schwarzer of the North Carolina Maritime Museums says "finding the Pulaski is a big deal." But he would like to see the ship's bell, boiler plate numbers, or some other definitive evidence. Webb hopes to find it. Per a press release, dives at the site will continue through the winter if the weather allows. (The last American slave ship might also be found.)

Original Story:  – The US State Department has issued a travel advisory for Mexico, saying that travelers to the country should "exercise increased caution" in general and avoid several states altogether. "Violent crime, such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery, are widespread, according to the advisory issued Wednesday. Among the states listed as "do not travel" are Colima, Guerrero, Michoacán, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas. "The US government has limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in many areas of Mexico as US government employees are prohibited from travel to these areas," the advisory says. The updated travel advisory was prompted by a security alert by the US Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, per a State Department spokesperson, Time reports. Also this week, Mexican authorities found eight dead bodies in Cancun, which is in the state of Quintana Roo, USA Today reports. Among the grisly discoveries, according to reports, were the dismembered bodies of two men, a man found dead in a hammock, the bodies of a man and woman in the trunk of a taxi, two men shot to death, and a body that had been decapitated. None of the killings took place in Cancun's beachside resort area, according to reports. Quintana Roo is under a Level 2 advisory, "exercise increased caution."

Original Story:  – Just a few days after being bitten by a cobra, Malaysia's famous "Snake Whisperer" has died. The Star and Free Malaysia Today report that 33-year-old firefighter Abu Zarin Hussin was attacked by the snake earlier this week in Betong while trying to catch it, and he was rushed to two different hospitals over the past several days, finally succumbing to his injuries in the ICU of the Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Hospital on Friday. Hussin, who the BBC says kept four snakes at home, had become both a local and international celebrity for his snake-handling acumen, which he used to train fellow firefighters so that they could respond to calls about snake sightings. Under Hussin's tutelage, firefighters learned how to ID different types of snakes, with a particular eye for the poisonous ones, as well as the most humane ways to capture them. Newsweek explains how Hussin shot to international fame in 2016 when overseas tabloids mistakenly used his picture for a story on a man who reportedly married his pet snake. An interview in the Star noted Hussin, who began his hobby in 2007, got his inspiration from his snake-charmer dad. "Before I joined the [fire department], I was afraid of snakes and would avoid them," he said. "But ... now [I] practice with [my father]." Hussin had been bitten a few times before, with one incident in 2015 even sending him into a two-day coma. But he couldn't stay away from the slithery reptiles, and he even took his act to Asia's Got Talent. A zookeeper tells the New Straits Times how, after he was bit by a snake in 2012, he met Hussin and struck up an instant friendship. "I have lost a daring and genuine friend," he says. (This man posed with a rattler, then got bit.)

Original Story:  – A hidden piece of software in your Android phone may be watching your every move and sending that information to an unknown recipient, a security researcher has alleged. In a video posted earlier this week, Android researcher Trevor Eckhart shows a program called Carrier IQ logging keystrokes, text messages, and web history—including supposedly secure HTTPS addresses, which sometimes contain username and password data, CNET reports. What’s worse, the program can’t be removed. Eckhart first broached his findings earlier this month, only to be slapped with a cease-and-desist order from Carrier IQ. The Electronic Frontier Foundation came to his defense and Carrier backed down, but insisted that it did not spy on customers and merely provided a “diagnostic tool” for companies. Sprint, a Carrier IQ client, said the data was used solely to assess network performance. Wired notes that the software is installed on most Android, Nokia, and Blackberry phones.

Original Story:  – Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell cast a bright picture of the US economy Wednesday and appeared to suggest that the Fed might consider a pause in its interest rate hikes next year to assess the impact of its credit tightening. Powell's comments ignited a rally on Wall Street, with the Dow surging more than 200 points after his remarks were released; it's up nearly 500 points as of this writing. Referring to the Fed's gradual increases in its benchmark rate, Powell said, "there is no preset policy path." Rather, he said, the Fed will assess the most recent economic and financial data in deciding whether or how fast to keep raising rates. The Fed has raised its benchmark short-term rate, now in a range of 2% to 2.25%, three times this year and is expected to do so again next month, reports the AP. The chairman also suggested that interest rates appear to be just below the level the Fed calls "neutral," where they are thought to neither stimulate growth nor impede it. That contrasted with a remark Powell made in October that the Fed's policy rate was still well below neutral. That remark had unsettled investors who feared it signaled that the Fed would continue raising rates well into the coming months. Speaking to the Economic Club of New York, the Fed chairman also said that while some corporate debt loads have reached riskier levels, "we do not see dangerous excesses in the stock market." He added that the Fed regards no major asset class as significantly inflated, "as some did, for example, in the late 1990s dot-com boom or the pre-crisis credit boom." (Trump wasn't too pleased with Powell yesterday, though.)

Original Story:  – Israel is searching for answers after seven people tried to end it all—and make a shocking public statement—with suicide by fire. The first was Moshe Silman, who killed himself with lighter fluid and a match at a rally for the first anniversary of Israel's Occupy movement on July 14. Among the six who followed, all have lived, but one is clinging to life. Their common themes: economic desperation and a hatred of government red tape, reports Global Post. "It’s a wave, nothing more than a wave," said a police spokesman. But a prominent Israeli journalist has written an op-ed that takes it more seriously: "This is a last call to the despaired who intend to commit suicide: For God’s sake, stop! Stop it!" writes Eitan Haber at YNet News. A doctor at one of Israel's suicide hotlines—which are swamped these days—says he senses "the desire to create an effect. ... It’s a psychological and sociological tempest."
Original Summary:  Seven people in Israel have attempted suicide by fire in recent weeks, with one person still clinging to life. The individuals who attempted suicide share similar themes of economic desperation and frustration with government bureaucracy. The police have characterized the incidents as a "wave" of suicides, but a prominent journalist has written an op-ed urging those considering suicide to seek help. A doctor at a suicide hotline has noted an increase in calls and believes the incidents are indicative of a larger psychological and sociological crisis.

The first was Moshe Silman, who killed himself with lighter fluid and a match at a rally for the first anniversary of Israel's Occupy movement on July 14. Among the six who followed, all have lived, but one is clinging to life. Their common themes: economic desperation and a hatred of government red tape, reports Global Post. "It’s a wave, nothing more than a wave," said a police spokesman. But a prominent Israeli journalist has written an op-ed that takes it more seriously: "This is a last call to the despaired who intend to commit suicide: For God’s sake, stop! Stop it!" writes Eitan Haber at YNet News. A doctor at one of Israel's suicide hotlines—which are swamped these days—says he senses "the desire to create an effect. . It’s a psychological and sociological tempest."
Injected Summary:  Seven people in Israel have attempted suicide by fire in recent weeks, with one person still clinging to life. The individuals who attempted suicide share similar themes of economic desperation and frustration with government bureaucracy. The police have characterized the incidents as a "wave" of suicides, but a prominent journalist has written an op-ed urging those considering suicide to seek help. A doctor at a suicide hotline has noted an increase in calls and believes the individuals are seeking to create a "psychological and sociological tempest."

Original Story:  – Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime is torturing and murdering its enemies on a vast and shocking scale, according to a cache of evidence released by war crimes prosecutors, CNN reports. The report relies on thousands of photos of dead bodies that were apparently killed by strangulation, starvation, and beatings; some had no eyes and others had been electrocuted, the Guardian reports. The bodies are "reminiscent of the pictures of those [who] were found still alive in the Nazi death camps after World War II," said Desmond de Silva, one of three lawyers who wrote the report. Each body was apparently taken to a doctor who wrote out a false cause of death, such as "heart attack"; the bodies were then buried and a death certificate given to the family. All 55,000 photos, showing 11,000 victims, were taken by a photographer for the Syrian military police who supports the rebel opposition and fled the country—but prosecutors still trusted his evidence. "This is a smoking gun," said David Crane, another report author. "This is direct evidence of the regime's killing machine." But legal action seems unlikely for now, CNN notes, because Syria is not in the International Criminal Court, and the UN Security Council won't act due to Russian veto power. "All we can do is put the ammunition in the pistol," said de Silva. "It is for others to aim it and pull the trigger." See a CNN video containing images from the report, but be warned, they are graphic.
Original Summary:  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime is accused of torturing and murdering thousands of people on a large scale, according to a report released by war crimes prosecutors. The report is based on a cache of 55,000 photos showing 11,000 victims, many of whom were killed by strangulation, starvation, and beatings. The photos are reminiscent of those found in Nazi death camps after World War II, according to one of the report's authors. The Syrian military photographer who took the photos fled the country but still provided evidence to prosecutors. Legal action against Assad's regime may be difficult due to Syria's lack of membership in the International Criminal Court and Russia's veto power in the UN Security Council.

Original Story:  – Introducing Metaspriggina, a minnow-sized fish that lived about 500 million years ago and appears to occupy a crucial branch of your family tree. Scientists say the creature might just be the ancestor of nearly all vertebrates, reports LiveScience. The revelation comes after study of dozens of remarkably well-preserved Metaspriggina fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. Researchers discovered that the fish had a pair of gill arches near the front of its body that are the "primitive precursors of the jaw," reports the Toronto Star. It's the first time such a feature has been seen in the fossil record, reports PhysOrg. “It was a major event in the evolution of vertebrates," says the co-author of a new report in Nature. "After the creation of jaws, vertebrates were able to capture prey and (chew) food." Metaspriggina also had something called a notochord, essentially cartilage that ran the length of its body. The New York Times notes that "human embryos develop a notochord, too, but it later turns into the disks of cartilage between the vertebrae in our spine." A British Columbia expert not involved with the work says the fish is "clearly a benchmark early vertebrate, which we haven't seen before."

Original Story:  – Some 141,000 cubic feet of rock tumbled from the face of an Italian cliff this month, sending a boulder tearing through a 300-year-old farm. The rock rolled through a barn in the Alto-Adige region, resulting in millions of dollars' worth of damage, says the manager of the site, which is owned by a Catholic order. No one was hurt, but experts fear another disaster, so the area has been evacuated, the Independent reports. The rock just missed a farmhouse and ended up in a vineyard, the AP reports, noting that another boulder stopped a few feet from the farmhouse. Other rocks from the same Jan. 21 rockfall blocked roads.

Original Story:  – On Thursday, Iran launched a satellite-carrying rocket into space in what was likely a notable advance for its space program, the AP reports. On Friday, the US and three other countries condemned that launch, and the US levied sanctions on six Iranian entities as punishment. According to Reuters, a member of the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency says the "Simorgh" rocket launched by Iran this week "could be configured to be an ICBM" of the type that could carry a nuclear warhead. "Progress in Iran's space program could shorten the pathway to an ICBM, as space-launch vehicles use similar technologies, with the exception of their payloads," he says. In a press release, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin calls it a "provocative space launch." In a joint statement, the US, Britain, Germany, and France say the rocket launch is "inconsistent" with the Iranian nuclear deal. "We call on Iran not to conduct any further ballistic missile launches and related activities," the statement reads. Sanctions levied Friday by the US target subsidiaries of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group that are "central to Iran's ballistic missile program." Iranian officials say they continue to comply with the nuclear deal. "Iran is not and will not be developing nuclear weapons," Iran's foreign minister says. But Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, says the US "can't trust" Iran. And experts believe Iran is using its space program as an excuse to create new military technologies.

Original Story:  – Boeing knew it had a big problem with the lithium-ion batteries in its 787 Dreamliners well before a fire prompted safety inquiries and the worldwide grounding of its prize aircraft, the New York Times reports. Officials at All Nippon Airways, which has the world's largest fleet of 787s, say they had to replace 10 of the batteries in the months before the fire after they failed to charge properly or failed to connect with the electrical system. The airline told Boeing about the problem but was not required to inform regulators because the battery trouble did not affect flights or present a safety problem. Japan Airlines says it had similar problems and National Transportation Safety Board investigators have now asked Boeing to provide a full operating history of the batteries, the AP reports. The Dreamliner remains grounded while regulators around the world investigate the problem.

Evan Leedy, 19, started a GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign for Robertson which has now raised more than $185,000 (and counting). The two men met at a bar last night, where they were interviewed. "I'm always going to be in your debt; I will never forget this," Robertson said. But he also noted: "I gotta say, this is Detroit, this is how people are in Detroit. They say Los Angeles is the city of angels. That's wrong. Detroit is the real city of angels."

Original Story:  – Another day, another devastating escalator accident in China. An employee at Longemont Shopping Mall in Shanghai's Changning district had his foot and part of his leg amputated after becoming trapped in an escalator on Saturday, according to the South China Morning Post. The worker, identified simply as Zhang, was cleaning the escalator with a mop when he reportedly stepped on it. The mall described the 35-year-old's action as an "improper" one, and said the mop's brush became "trapped inside the gap in the stairs, which caused cracks in the comb plate." Video of the incident shows the escalator's floor plate breaking away, and Zhang's left foot falling inside the moving staircase. A relative reportedly told local media, "The doctor said he had to amputate the [foot] to avoid the injuries from deteriorating." The accident is the fourth escalator tragedy in China in a week. As previously reported, Xiang Liujuan, 30, was killed a week before Zhang's incident when she similarly fell through an escalator floor plate at Anliang department store in Hubei province. A graphic video shows Xiang pushing her son to safety before she is sucked to her death. Days after that accident, a 1-year-old's arm was seriously injured after it became trapped in an escalator in Guangxi province, NBC News reports, and a 6-year-old was injured Saturday after his foot was caught in an escalator in Beijing. The incidents have led to escalator quality inspections in Shanghai and Hubei. (Workers reportedly warned the mother just before she was swallowed by the escalator.)

Original Story:  – Remember that massive Equifax data breach that exposed the names, security numbers, and more of 143 million US consumers? It now appears Equifax had "clear and simple instructions" on how to avoid it and more than two months to follow them. The credit reporting company announced Thursday that hackers exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application between May and July, Ars Technica reports. But here's the thing: A patch to fix that particular vulnerability had been available for more than two months by that point. "This vulnerability was disclosed back in March," a researcher at an analytics security firm tells Wired. "There were clear and simple instructions of how to remedy the situation." Not only was a patch available to Equifax, but there were public reports back in March of hackers exploiting websites that hadn't yet fixed the Apache Struts vulnerability. The New York Times reports it's unclear why Equifax didn't patch the vulnerability. "Most breaches we become aware of are caused by failure to update software components that are known to be vulnerable for months or even years," Wired quotes the vice president of Apache Struts as saying. Experts say it would have been fairly easy for hackers to exploit the vulnerability with Equifax having not patched it.

Original Story:  – President Trump has noted more than once he thinks we should've taken Iraq's oil when we had the chance (and suggests that option may still be on the table), but his secretary of defense is pushing a different message—what the New York Times characterizes as comments that would previously have been deemed "unthinkable" under other administrations—on the eve of his first visit to the Middle East country as head of the Pentagon. "We're not in Iraq to seize anybody's oil," James Mattis told reporters Sunday night, per the Washington Post. Mattis added that US citizens have "generally paid for our gas and oil all along," and he doesn't see why that wouldn't continue. Mattis was traveling to Iraq Monday to gather intel and scope out the best ways to fight ISIS, a topic for which he's scheduled to lay out a game plan in a couple of weeks. The AP reported last month that Trump has noted that his enthusiasm for taking Iraq's oil is something "I have long said." The Post and CNN, meanwhile, report that Trump more recently brought up the subject the day after his inauguration—when he said during a CIA visit, "We should have kept the oil. Maybe we'll have another chance"—and also during an ABC News interview a few days later, in which he added, "You wouldn't have ISIS if we took the oil." Last week, the defense secretary smoothed over things with NATO members by telling them the US still values the group, despite Trump's past comments, while on Sunday Mattis said he doesn't think the media is an enemy of the American people like his boss does. (What may be more worrisome for Iraq than ISIS: Mosul's dam.)
Original Summary:  President Trump has expressed interest in taking Iraq's oil, but his Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, has stated that the US is not in Iraq to seize anyone's oil.

The defense secretary is set to gather intelligence and develop a plan to fight ISIS in Iraq, despite Trump's past comments on the matter. Trump has previously stated that the US should have taken Iraq's oil and may still consider it an option. However, Mattis has made it clear that the US is not interested in seizing Iraq's oil.

Last week, the defense secretary smoothed over things with NATO members by telling them the US still values the group, despite Trump's past comments, while on Sunday Mattis said he doesn't think the media is an enemy of the American people like his boss does. (What may be more worrisome for Iraq than ISIS: Mosul's dam.)
Injected Summary:  President Trump has expressed interest in taking Iraq's oil, but his Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, has stated that the US is not in Iraq to seize anyone's oil. Mattis has also said that US citizens have paid for their gas and oil all along and sees no reason why that wouldn't continue. The defense secretary is set to gather intelligence and develop a plan to fight ISIS in Iraq, despite Trump's past comments on the matter. Trump has previously stated that the US should have taken Iraq's oil and may still consider it an option. However, Mattis has made it clear that the US is not interested in seizing Iraq's oil.

Original Story:  – The disasters continue at Bangladesh's garment factories. There was the fire that killed more than 100 people late last year; then another fire in January; then the building collapse whose confirmed death toll has reached 912. Now, yet another fire has killed at least eight people in a Dhaka garment factory—including, reportedly, the building owner and a police officer, the BBC notes. "It was a big fire, but we managed to confine it on one floor," an official tells AFP. Most employees had already left work when the fire began, but "toxic smoke from burnt acrylic clothing" killed the victims. The fire occurred in an 11-story building owned by the Tung Hai Group, a garment-exporting firm; the cause is under investigation, said a garment industry leader. Safety concerns had prompted the closure of 18 garment factories, the Bangladesh government said yesterday; six were approved to open again today, Reuters reports.

Original Story:  – Jaywalkers take heed: If you do it in parts of China, you could be in for the shaming of your life. Authorities have installed a new device called the "Electronic Police" at intersections in cities in four provinces. Not only does it detect when people are jaywalking, but it snaps photos of the offenders and uses facial recognition tech to pull up their images in the provincial police database, reports RT. Once police confirm a match, the person isn't just flagged for the offense (they can choose whether to pay a fine, take a safety class, or volunteer with traffic police). Their photo and personal details, including parts of their ID number and home address, are displayed on a large screen for all passersby to see. Facial recognition has already been used in China to catch toilet paper thieves in public restrooms and to predict orders at the fast food chain KFC, reports the AFP. But the use of public shaming takes things to a whole new level—one that local police say is proving effective. They say public shaming can go so far as to impact insurance and pension premiums, and police in the city of Jinan say they've caught more than 6,200 people crossing at red lights since installing the system in early May (yes, that's less than two months), with the number of incidents dropping ten-fold from 200 per day to 20. Jinan is looking to install the system at 50 other major intersections by the end of June, each costing the city roughly $15,000, reports Mashable. (Texting pedestrians are hit with fines in parts of New Jersey.)

Original Story:  – In the latest study proving everything in the world is dangerous, researchers are warning about a possible link between sunscreen and male fertility problems. The scientists investigated urine-sample data from 500 couples trying to have kids. They found that among couples taking the longest time to conceive, male partners had high levels of certain common sunscreen chemicals in their urine, CNN reports. Specifically, the guys showed high concentrations of the ultraviolet filters BP-2 or 4OH-BP, which are also found in shampoos and moisturizers. As for women, those in the study "actually had greater exposure to the UV filters overall, but their exposure wasn’t associated with any significant pregnancy delays," researcher Germaine Louis says in an NIH press release. Companies aren't legally required to list these chemicals in their products' ingredients, though lawmakers might take on the issue if further research confirms the findings, Louis says. Meanwhile, she clarifies her message: "We definitely encourage people to continue using sunscreen to avoid skin cancer. But men who are concerned about fertility may be interested in other ways to reduce their exposure to benzophenone UV filters—whether by cutting back on other products that contain the UV filters or by washing after returning indoors." (Another recent study found that macho men have so-so sperm.)

The Miami Herald reports Mexico's Original Group, which already operates a number of adults-only resorts, will erotically embark on an eight-day sex cruise in 2017. The Desire Cruise features “clothing-optional areas (including the pool), private playrooms, adult-oriented entertainment, and provocative theme nights," according to its website. There will also be "intense icebreakers." The Original Group's CEO tells the Herald the cruise will be "the sensual way to get away." The Desire Cruise will take place aboard Royal Caribbean's 690-person Azamara Quest. And sorry looky-loos, but the New York Daily News reports it's couples-only. Other rules include: no nudity in the dining room and no sex with the crew. The cruise leaves from Italy in September 2017 with stops in Croatia and Slovenia, and, presumably, Bonetown. Esquire helpfully lists the sights high-seas sex-havers can expect to see, including "butts," "more butts," and "the striking waterfront installations of Croatian architect Nikola Bašic.” Tickets for this boat-based bacchanalia run between $2,800 and $11,000.

Original Story:  – As many as 12 World War II bunkers have been identified beneath the city of Rome, thought to have been built for Benito Mussolini or other party leaders, reports Business Insider. Three are now set to open to the public on Halloween; two were opened for a short time in 2006, but one will be made public for the first time. The new site is a shelter made from a converted wine cellar that lies under Mussolini's elaborate gardens, roughly 400 feet from his villa's living quarters (the family would have had to run above ground to reach it). AP describes it as being hastily constructed in 1940, and notes its iron-rung ladder (for "emergency exits") and a rusting machine meant to purify the air in the event of a gas attack. The bunker and its anti-gas doors will serve as a stark reminder of "one of the darkest pages of our history," according to Rome's department for culture, per Reuters. After refashioning the wine cellar, Mussolini went on to build at least two more bunkers, one of which was reinforced with up to 13 feet of concrete. Mussolini was arrested before it had been completed, but had it been finished, it would have been Italy's most resistant air raid shelter devoted to just one family. (A bunker that may have been designed for Mussolini and his mistress was discovered in 2011.)

Original Story:  – A Michigan mom is upset over the "pornographic" material her 7th-grade daughter was assigned to read: The Diary of Anne Frank. Gail Horalek made the porn comparison because, in the full and unedited version of the book, Frank writes about her genitalia, the Christian Post explains. Horalek filed a formal complaint with the school district, and says the school should remove the book, use the edited version, or at least have parents sign a permission slip before making kids read the unedited version. Fox 2 Detroit offers up the offending passage, which reads in part: "What's even funnier is that I thought urine came out of the clitoris ... When you're standing up, all you see from the front is hair. Between your legs there are two soft, cushiony things, also covered with hair, which press together when you're standing, so you can't see what's inside. They separate when you sit down and they're very red and quite fleshy on the inside." Horalek says she discovered the material when her daughter read it and told her mother it made her uncomfortable. "It doesn’t mean my child is sheltered, it doesn’t mean I live in a bubble, and it doesn’t mean I'm trying to ban books," Horalek tells the Northville Patch.

Robert Bentley and approved his request for federal emergency assistance, including search and rescue teams. Tuscaloosa's mayor estimates "hundreds of homes and businesses (were) destroyed and hundreds more damaged" around the University of Alabama campus, reports the BBC, and the city's infrastructure has been devastated. "What we faced today was massive damage on a scale we have not seen in Tuscaloosa in quite some time," he told reporters.

Original Story:  – The ancient bones of the Kennewick Man have been returned to the ground. More than 200 members of five Columbia Plateau tribes and bands gathered at an undisclosed location over the weekend to lay the remains of the man they call "the Ancient One" to rest, according to an announcement Sunday by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Tri-City Herald reports. "We always knew the Ancient One to be Indian," says Aaron Ashley, Umatilla board member and chairman of the Cultural Resources Committee. "We have oral stories that tell of our history on this land, and we knew, at the moment of his discovery, that he was our relation." However, tribal members waited more than 20 years to be allowed to rebury the bones, which are believed to be about 8,400 years old, the AP reports. Kennewick Man was found on the banks of the Columbia River about 20 years ago by two college students in Kennewick, Wash. The skeleton is among the oldest and most complete found in North America, and though tribes immediately filed claims for the Ancient One, a federal judge decided to allow scientists to study the bones. A DNA study in 2015 concluded the remains were Native American, and legislation signed by Barack Obama on Dec. 19 required the skeleton to be turned over to the coalition of tribes within 90 days.
Original Summary:  The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and other Columbia Plateau tribes gathered to rebury the ancient Kennewick Man bones, which are estimated to be around 8,400 years old. The tribes had been waiting over 20 years to rebury the bones, which were discovered on the Columbia River banks. The skeleton is one of the oldest and most complete found in North America, and the tribes have long considered it to be their ancestor. A DNA study in 2015 confirmed the remains were Native American, and a federal law required the skeleton to be returned to the tribes. The reburial ceremony was held at an undisclosed location.

Original Story:  – The good news: Hundreds of MS-13 gang members have been arrested over the past few years. The bad news: Those gang members are now wreaking havoc in the prisons they're in, perpetrating acts of violence and extortion to gain control over their locked-down domains. The Washington Post details the increasing number of gang fights and attacks resulting from MS-13's desire to take charge of their surroundings. "MS-13 presents unique challenges … to the correctional system," the head of Maryland's corrections system says. The Post notes that as the percentage of MS-13 members in prisons' overall populations rises—local prisons the paper surveyed report double-digit percent increases in MS-13 inmates over the past two years—so do the problems as the MS-13ers get into "turf wars" with members of other gangs like the Bloods, Crips, and Aryan Brotherhood. In the case of one Maryland prison, MS-13 members even started imposing a "tax" on fellow inmates (usually Hispanics), offering them protection in exchange for commissary goods. Other inmates eventually balked, immediately attacking any MS-13 member transferred to their unit as a preemptive strike. Prison officials try to separate MS-13 members so they can't work together, and also attempt to keep them away from rival gangs, as there are often "jump on sight" directives when rivals are spotted. Sometimes MS-13 members, often in prison for extended periods due to the serious nature of their crimes, have to be transferred to another prison to remedy the issues. Check out the Post for its interviews with a handful of the alleged gang members, as well as the New York Times for why President Trump referenced the gang in his State of the Union speech.

Original Story:  – It's been a year since the Catholic Church chose Jorge Bergoglio as its new pope, and while Pope Francis marks the anniversary with a low-key, week-long spiritual retreat with cardinals and bishops—he characteristically traveled there by bus—here's a look at how he's been doing over the last 12 months: People love Francis: The first non-European pope in 1,000 years hasn't had trouble fitting in. Italian opinion polls give him the highest popularity of any recent pope, while the US approval rate sits at 55%, even as the UN has ripped the Vatican a new one, the Wall Street Journal and the BBC note. That's not to mention his 11 million followers across his various Twitter accounts, the huge crowds, and pilgrims flocking to Rome in record numbers. Compassion: His high standing could have a lot to do with the compassion he's shown divorcees, those who've abandoned Mass, gay people, and Jews and Muslims, even though his views don't always get a lot of support from traditionalist cardinals. No deep change: But has anything really changed? A BBC correspondent notes Francis has given us that perception—whereas predecessor Pope Benedict called homosexuality "intrinsically evil," Francis has said he's not one to judge—but it has been "a change of style rather than of substance." As for the Catholic Church's stance on birth control or the celibacy rule for priests, there doesn't seem to be any budging. Still, E.J. Dionne notes in the Washington Post that Francis' first year has been "an anti-imperial papacy" from the start. "He has not altered church doctrine, but his shift in emphasis has been breathtaking," and his ability to move beyond gay marriage, birth control, and abortion, shows his stance is "primarily with and for the neediest." His overhaul of the Congregation for Bishops and appointment of "outsider" cardinals to advise him on church reform stands out, too, and shows a move toward a horizontal church, inspired by Jesuits. "Liberals who would like to see significant doctrinal shifts from Francis should alter their expectations," write Lizzy Davies and Sam Jones for the Guardian. "But that doesn't mean there will be no change at all." Next up: The Vatican Bank will be at the heart of Pope Francis' reforms and he hasn't ruled out closing it for good. Meanwhile, all eyes will be on how he responds to sex abuse allegations within the church—his emerging blind spot, the Guardian notes.
Original Summary:  Pope Francis has been in office for a year and has been popular among Catholics, with high approval ratings in Italy and the US. He has shown compassion towards marginalized groups, such as divorcees, LGBTQ individuals, and Jews and Muslims. However, there has been little change in the Catholic Church's stance on controversial issues like birth control and priestly celibacy. Francis has made some changes to the Church's leadership, including appointing "outsider" cardinals to advise him on reform. The Vatican Bank is expected to be a focus of Francis' reforms, and he has not ruled out closing it permanently.

Original Story:  – Philip Morris has launched its IQOS smokeless cigarette in the UK, adding to the product's presence in more than a dozen other markets overseas, including Japan and Italy, City AM reports. The cigarette alternative heats up just enough tobacco without burning it to create a vapor, leading to a strong flavor and a nicotine content that's said to be less than 10% of traditional cigarettes, the company notes. And per Andre Calantzopoulos, the company's CEO, that's opened the door even further to the idea that Philip Morris may one day get out of the cigarette business altogether, he told BBC Radio 4 Wednesday. "I believe there will come a moment in time where I would say we have sufficient adoption of these alternative products … to start envisaging ... a phase-out period for cigarettes," he said, per Reuters. "I hope this time will come soon." Per the Wall Street Journal, alternatives like IQOS could help tobacco companies offer a product that's both enjoyable to smoke and presumably safer than traditional cigarettes. E-cigs vaporize nicotine in liquid, but some users say they don't offer a strong-enough "hit." The IQOS product, however, heats tobacco in mini "HeatSticks" to about 660 degrees Fahrenheit (regular cigs can reach nearly 1500 degrees)—hot enough to deliver tobacco flavor, but without smoke and tar, Vape Ranks notes. Reuters notes Philip Morris, which makes most of the world's Marlboro cigarettes, still pulls in most of its profit from regular cigarettes, but Calantzopoulos says it's funneled more than $2 billion into "reduced risk" products, and at least two other companies have tobacco-based smoking alternatives on shelves or in the works. (An e-cigarette shot a fireball at a girl in an Orlando theme park.)

Original Story:  – Abraham Lincoln helped free a black male slave long before the Civil War, and researchers say they've found the man's grave—in a former psychiatric hospital's cemetery, the AP reports. A budding lawyer, Lincoln won a case before the Illinois Supreme Court in 1841 that released Nance Legins-Costley from indentured servitude, which historians say amounted to slavery for a black woman. Legins-Costley walked away with her 10-month-old son, William Henry Costley, and lived to a ripe old age in her central Illinois hometown of Pekin. But what became of the first black male slave freed by Lincoln? An amateur historian named Carl Adams spent years investigating the story and published a book about Legins-Costley last year, Nance: Trials of the First Slave Freed by Abraham Lincoln—A True Story of Nance Legins-Costley. The editor of a history journal says Nance tells "the only story of Lincoln that is really new," according to a site dedicated to the book. Costley apparently enlisted in a colored-troops regiment from Illinois in 1864, was wounded in the war, and found himself dispatched in Galveston, Texas. A few years later, an all-white jury found him not guilty in the shooting death of a man considered disreputable; Costley said he was protecting a woman when he pulled the trigger. Eventually, Costley moved to Minnesota, became an invalid, and lived in a psychiatric hospital in Rochester. There, Adams says, lies a grave that matches a number from hospital records as Costley's. It also recently received a "Costley" headstone. "I think it is so likely that it's nearly a sure thing," says a Lincoln expert. (Read about a black slave whose story was rewritten, 150 years later.)

An amateur historian has identified a grave in Rochester, Minnesota, that may be Costley's, and a Lincoln expert believes it is likely to be his final resting place.

Original Story:  – Terrified travelers dove for cover yesterday as three federal police officers were fatally shot in the middle of a food hall at Mexico City's busy international airport by men wearing police uniforms, witnesses report. Two officers were shot dead at the scene, and the third died later of his injuries. They were attempting to detain suspects in a drug case, officials told the BBC. "Some policemen came in and started shooting at another policeman who was on the floor," said a witness. "We dove to the floor and covered ourselves with chairs. It took us a while to believe that they were actually gunshots." Investigators believe the shooters are actual federal officers working for drug traffickers, and part of an airport network of crooks that includes several local and federal officials, reports the AP. The killers have been identified on airport surveillance cameras, but are still on the lam. The airport is a key hub of drug trafficking operations in Mexico, but the killings were the first major outbreak of violence there.

Original Story:  – The vast majority of humanity is breathing dirty air, putting us at risk of heart disease, stroke, and lung disease, the World Health Organization says. The agency's most detailed analysis yet of air pollution reveals that 92% of the world's population is breathing air that fails to meet basic health standards, NPR reports. About 6.5 million deaths per year are linked to air pollution, 3 million of them exclusively to outdoor exposure, which was the focus of the study. In 2012, one of every nine deaths was linked to bad air, with devastating consequences. "Air pollution continues to take a toll on the health of the most vulnerable populations—women, children and the older adults," said Flavia Bustreo, WHO's assistant director general, in a news release. "For people to be healthy, they must breathe clean air from their first breath to their last." China was by far the worst off, with more than 1 million deaths in 2012, followed by India with 621,000. (The US had 38,000, Australia only 94.) Sources include dirty cars and buses, household fuel, waste burning, and power plants. The WHO used air-pollution data from nearly 3,000 spots obtained from satellites and ground stations to measure airborne particulate matter such as sulphates and nitrates. But because the samples did not include known pollutants such as ozone, actual air quality could be far worse. Just last month, US researchers said that cracking down just a bit on ozone and particulate matter standards could save 9,000 lives a year, NBC News reports. The WHO's Maria Neria said the mortality breakdown by country ought to spur a global crackdown on air pollution. "What we are learning is, this is very bad. Now there are no excuses for not taking action," she told the Guardian. (One study said air pollution could be linked to Alzheimer's disease.)
Original Summary:  The World Health Organization (WHO) has found that 92% of the world's population is breathing air that fails to meet basic health standards, with 6.5 million deaths per year linked to air pollution. The majority of these deaths are due to outdoor exposure, with China and India being the worst affected. The WHO used satellite and ground station data to measure airborne particulate matter, but noted that actual air quality could be worse due to the absence of known pollutants such as ozone. The organization's findings suggest that cracking down on air pollution standards could save thousands of lives each year. The WHO's Maria Neria emphasized the urgent need for action to address the issue, citing the potential link between air pollution and Alzheimer's disease.

"For people to be healthy, they must breathe clean air from their first breath to their last." China was by far the worst off, with more than 1 million deaths in 2012, followed by India with 621,000. (The US had 38,000, Australia only 94.) Sources include dirty cars and buses, household fuel, waste burning, and power plants. The WHO used air-pollution data from nearly 3,000 spots obtained from satellites and ground stations to measure airborne particulate matter such as sulphates and nitrates. But because the samples did not include known pollutants such as ozone, actual air quality could be far worse. Just last month, US researchers said that cracking down just a bit on ozone and particulate matter standards could save 9,000 lives a year, NBC News reports. The WHO's Maria Neria said the mortality breakdown by country ought to spur a global crackdown on air pollution. "What we are learning is, this is very bad. Now there are no excuses for not taking action," she told the Guardian. (One study said air pollution could be linked to Alzheimer's disease.)
Injected Summary:  The World Health Organization (WHO) has found that 92% of the world's population is breathing air that fails to meet basic health standards, with 6.5 million deaths per year linked to air pollution. The majority of these deaths are due to outdoor exposure, with China and India being the worst affected. The WHO used satellite and ground station data to measure airborne particulate matter, but noted that actual air quality could be worse due to the absence of known pollutants such as ozone. The organization's findings suggest that cracking down on air pollution standards could save thousands of lives each year. The WHO's Maria Neria emphasized the urgent need for action to address the issue, citing the potential link between air pollution and Alzheimer's disease.

Original Story:  – When a highly automated train crashed into a Quebec town last weekend, its conductor was not on board. Which raises a few questions, writes Holman Jenkins at the Wall Street Journal. Why couldn't the train tell headquarters it had taken off? Why couldn't headquarters stop it from afar? And most fundamentally, "Why does a train need an operator?" The same question came to mind in the Asiana crash, in which human pilots appear to have been relying on a system that was down at the time. Humans pilots are losing a dangerous amount of skill as they rely on the computers, and "operating a train, a plane or a car is arguably becoming a poor use of human capital anyway." Yes, unemployment is high now, but as our population ages, we'll soon have a workforce crunch. Fully automated transportation is necessary, and seemingly inevitable with Google already advancing self-driving cars. "If computers ever get the vote, they will quickly vote the rest of us off the road as the major hazard to their safely zooming around." Click for the full column.
Original Summary:  A recent train crash in Quebec highlights concerns about the role of human operators in transportation. The train's conductor was not on board when it crashed, raising questions about why a train needs an operator in the first place. The use of automation in transportation is becoming more prevalent, with systems like autopilot and self-driving cars being developed. However, relying too heavily on technology can lead to a loss of human skill and a potential workforce crunch in the future. Fully automated transportation may be necessary and inevitable, but it raises questions about the safety of having computers in control of vehicles.

Original Story:  – A group known for fighting for the separation of church and state has won a victory against Brewster County, Texas, reaching a settlement that has county cops agreeing to remove decals with crosses on them from police cars, Reuters reports. In response to a suit filed this year by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, Brewster officials now say they won't allow the stickers—depicting foot-high blue Latin crosses, per the Austin American-Statesman—on the vehicles, citing a recently approved county policy that bans "political, religious, commercial or personal" symbols or messages from appearing on any county property. Also per the settlement, the county will fork over $22,000 and change in legal and court fees to the FFRF. The high-profile hubbub started late in 2015 when the office for Brewster County Sheriff Ronny Dodson requested the OK for the cross decals in the rear windows of his deputies' patrol vehicles, noting the stickers would provide "God's protection." But the FFRF said such an action would be unconstitutional, violating the First Amendment's prohibition against government favoring one religion over another. One person who had stood behind Brewster's men and women in blue: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who wrote before the complaint was filed that "in addition to its religious significance, the cross has a long history in America and elsewhere as a symbol of service and sacrifice." Reuters didn't have a comment yet from Abbott, but the co-president of the FFRF says the whole deal "was totally avoidable. This was such an egregious and obvious violation." Also profiting from the settlement: two Brewster County atheists who had joined the lawsuit. They each received $1. (Tennessee lawmakers wanted the Bible as their state book.)

Original Story:  – An alarming new analysis of gun data finds that at least 79 American kids shot someone accidentally in the first four months of this year—and 25 of those kids were between the ages of two and four years old. In those 79 incidents, 24 people were killed and 56 were injured, Vocativ reports. Everytown for Gun Safety offers an interactive map showing all of the incidents, like a 4-year-old who fatally shot himself with his babysitter's gun and a 3-year-old who accidentally shot both of his parents. As a press release from Everytown and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America points out, the data translates to this disturbing thought: "That's an average of one unintentional child shooting in America every 36 hours." At least 35 of the kids involved in these incidents shot themselves, and 12 of those children died. Everytown notes that up to 2 million US kids have "easily accessible" firearms in their homes, and stresses the importance of locking guns up.

Original Story:  – A man with a knife attacked people at the main train station in the southeastern French city of Marseille on Sunday, killing two women before paramilitary soldiers fatally shot the assailant, officials said. French police warned people to avoid the Saint Charles train station, tweeting that an operation was underway. Soldiers and police took up positions outside the station, which was evacuated, the AP reports. The incident is being treated as a terror attack, the city prosecutor's office told CNN. Three police officials said one woman was stabbed to death; two of the officials said the other woman's throat was slit. The assailant was shot dead by soldiers who were patrolling the station. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb tweeted that he would travel to the scene. The Guardian notes that the soldiers who opened fire were from Operation Sentinelle, which was launched after the deadly terror attacks in France in 2015. The soldiers—whose numbers are said to range between 7,000 and 10,000—patrol major tourist sites, places of worship, train stations, schools, and airports across France. Earlier this month, four American college students were attacked with acid at the same train station in Marseille. At the time, French authorities said the assailant was suffering from a mental illness and it wasn't investigated as a terror attack. No further details were immediately given for this attack, including a motive.

Original Story:  – Almost eight years after it stopped communicating with ground stations, NASA has rediscovered India's Chandrayaan-1 lunar probe. The long-lost spacecraft didn't crash into the lunar surface in 2009, as some had suspected, but continued circling the moon in a slightly different orbit. NASA says it detected the small cubic probe, which it describes as being around 5 feet per side, with a beam of microwaves sent from a 230-foot antenna at its Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex in California. Scientists had to use ground-based radar because lunar glare made it impossible to spot the probe through optical telescopes, Engadget notes. NASA says it knew Chandrayaan-1 was in a polar orbit, so it trained the beam on the moon's north pole and waited for the spacecraft to cross it. The agency says the radar technique could help future lunar missions by averting collisions with derelict spacecraft and by aiding spacecraft suffering communication difficulties. The probe was launched in 2008 for what was supposed to be a two-year mission mapping the lunar surface. "To be declared lost and then found after eight years is a great accomplishment," Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, known as the father of India's moon mission, tells the Times of India. "Chandrayaan-1 was our first interplanetary mission and I am delighted that it has been found." (NASA has lost a legal battle over a stolen bag of moon dust.)

Original Story:  – Mark Zuckerberg has "thrown shade" at Elon Musk before regarding Musk's wariness of artificial intelligence, most recently on Sunday. On Tuesday, the Tesla founder threw some shade of his own right back. Musk is concerned that artificial intelligence could someday threaten humanity, possibly becoming more dangerous than nuclear weapons, but Zuck said Sunday during a Facebook Live video that he thinks AI is promising and "people who are naysayers and ... try to drum up these doomsday scenarios ... I don't understand it. It's really negative, and in some ways, I actually think it's pretty irresponsible." Musk's response was short and sweet: "I've talked to Mark about this," he tweeted. "His understanding of the subject is limited." Per Zuck, while technology can always be used for good or bad purposes and those who build it need to be careful, it's "questionable" to argue for slowing down the development of AI. "If you're arguing against AI, then you're arguing against safer cars that aren't going to have accidents, and you're arguing against being able to better diagnose people when they're sick," the Facebook founder said in the video, as reported by Business Insider. Expect more from Musk soon; also Tuesday on Twitter, he teased a "movie on the subject coming soon." TechCrunch (which has a piece up Tuesday insisting AI "is not as smart as" Musk thinks) notes that the founding director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab has said Musk's understanding of AI is limited.

Original Story:  – In what American commanders called a crime against the people of Iraq and the country's prime minister called an admission of defeat, officials say ISIS fighters blew up Mosul's most iconic mosque Wednesday night as government troops closed in. The Grand al-Nuri Mosque, more than 800 years old, was where ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate in 2014 during his only public appearance, the BBC reports. ISIS—whose fighters had been seen bringing explosives to the site, according to CNN—claimed the mosque in Mosul's Old City had been destroyed by American aircraft, but US commanders swiftly denied the claim, saying there had been no strikes in the area. Aerial photos showed little but rubble remaining at the mosque complex, where the black flag of ISIS had flown since 2014. The destruction of the mosque and its famous minaret "amounts to an official acknowledgement of defeat," Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi said in a statement. The Old City is the only part of Mosul still held by ISIS, and commanders say the "final chapter" of the offensive to retake the city has begun. The Iraqi military says elite counterterrorism units had fought their way to within 170 feet of the mosque, which is at the southern edge of the Old City, when it was destroyed, Reuters reports. (Russia says al-Baghdadi may have been killed in an airstrike last month.)

Original Story:  – Erin Brockovich is calling it the worst environmental catastrophe since the 2010 BP oil spill: Methane has been leaking from a well in Los Angeles for at least two months and will continue to do so for at least two more. Southern California Gas detected the leak—seen here using an infrared camera—at its underground natural-gas storage facility in the Porter Ranch neighborhood on Oct. 23, but it took officials until Sunday to identify the leaking well, per Quartz. As for exactly where the leak itself is in the 8,700-foot-deep well, the company is "not sure," a rep tells the Los Angeles Times. Officials' solution: They've been drilling a relief well, which has hit a depth of 3,800 feet. CBS News reports they'll go another 5,000 feet or so, intersect the leaking well, and plug it. They expect the drilling to be done Feb. 24. Several families are now suing SoCal Gas, per CBS News; 2,200 families have been relocated; and the county has fielded "a substantial number of reports" from people complaining of headaches and nausea. Popular Mechanics notes the FAA has gone so far as to keep flights out of the area. And then there's the environmental toll: The Environmental Defense Fund says the leak has the same daily impact as do the emissions from 7 million cars—LA County has 6.2 million. The director of the EDF's California oil and gas program adds that the Porter Ranch site is part of an aging network of natural gas plants and pipelines. "This type of event could happen at any one of these other sites," says Tim O'Connor. As for Brockovich's claim, he tells Quartz it's an apples-and-oranges thing—but this "a very big orange."

The company is drilling a relief well to plug the leak, which is estimated to be 8,700 feet deep, and is expected to be completed by February 24. The leak has caused 2,200 families to be relocated and has resulted in a significant number of complaints of headaches and nausea. The environmental impact of the leak is significant, with the daily emissions equivalent to those of 7 million cars in Los Angeles County.

Original Story:  – The plight of a Canadian boy who just wanted to eat a hamburger is drawing attention to a risk that many backyard barbecuers may not realize even exists: wire brush bristles ending up in people's throats. CBC reports 6-year-old Anthony Fiore took a bite of a burger in June only to feel a sharp pain. "It felt like a needle," he says. Twelve hours later, Anthony was in surgery having a wire bristle removed from his throat. His mom, Nadia Cerelli, spoke out about the incident this week to draw attention to what is a growing problem. "I hope to have these brushes removed from the shelves, have them banned," she says. Bristles coming loose from barbecue brushes, then finding their way from grill to food to throat is getting to be such an issue that the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology addressed it at its annual meeting this year. "None of us have figured out a surefire way to get rid of them, so we’d prefer just to prevent it from happening in the first place," Munchies quotes one otolaryngologist as saying. While surgeons in Canada are recommending no one use barbecue brushes with wire bristles, it's also a problem here in the US. One study found nearly 1,700 injuries from wire bristles in the US since 2002, the Austin American-Statesman reports. And according to CTV, researchers believe that number is an underestimate. (Another unexpectedly deadly item: these kites.)
Original Summary:  A 6-year-old Canadian boy, Anthony Fiore, required surgery to remove a wire bristle from his throat after biting into a hamburger. The incident has brought attention to the risk of wire bristles from barbecue brushes entering food and causing harm. According to the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology, there is no surefire way to remove the bristles once they are ingested, so prevention is key. In the US, nearly 1,700 injuries from wire bristles have been reported since 2002, with some experts believing the actual number is higher. The issue highlights the importance of using safe and reliable barbecue brushes to avoid such accidents.
