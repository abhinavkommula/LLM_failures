Original Story:  – "Sadly, we are obliged to halt the Eye of Sauron" is both the best line from a press release you'll read all week and the worst. Russian creative art group Svecheniye has halted a "fan project" that would have placed a menacing, pulsing eye like the one featured in the Lord of the Rings movies smack in the middle of Moscow's business district, the BBC reports. The glowing 3.3-foot orb (complete with a 3D light show behind it) was originally scheduled to be turned on either Wednesday or Thursday on the 21st floor of one of the Moscow International Business Center towers to celebrate The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, notes the Guardian. But someone—specifically, the Russian Orthodox Church—had a major problem with it. "This is a demonic symbol," the church's head of public affairs reportedly told a local radio station. "Such a symbol of the triumph of evil is rising up over the city, becoming practically the highest object in the city. … Don't be surprised later if something goes wrong with the city." He also called the eye a representation of Satan, Business Insider adds. Although Svecheniye said in a press release there was no "religious or political subtext" behind the ocular art installation, it said it was sorry for having "elicited such a public reaction." One reader of a local newspaper thinks the church's complaint just ensures that "magic, sorcery, and witchcraft will gain even more public attention," while another reader has an alternate destination for Sauron's gaze: "The roof of the US Embassy's the best place for it." (What's the church afraid of? There's even a dinosaur named after the Eye of Sauron.)

Original Story:  – It was like any other Tuesday on Cosmopolitan's Twitter feed, with tweets about a possible Gilmore Girls revival, women who apply makeup with tampons, and ... a weight loss story that sent the internet into a tizzy. The offending tweet, since deleted, linked to an article titled "How This Woman Lost 44 Pounds Without Any Exercise." The article documented the story of 31-year-old Australian mom Simone Harbinson, who suffered a recent "waterfall of health scares" that included appendix cancer and complications from her illness and the resulting surgeries. She started eating for comfort after her cancer diagnosis and gained 35 pounds. She eventually set her mind to losing the weight, but because of her condition, she couldn't exercise like she used to. Instead, she started meal-prepping and following a nutrition program that resulted in her losing 44 pounds, undergoing an "incredible … mental transformation." That positivity didn't translate to the entire internet, per Page Six and the Washington Post, which note that folks didn't appreciate clicking on a weight loss headline and finding that a woman with cancer had lost the weight. "Cancer is not a diet plan. Delete this," tweeted ex-NFL player Matthew Cherry, perhaps misinterpreting (as many others apparently did) that Harbinson lost the weight as a direct effect of the cancer. But some clearly understood Harbinson's story and are still taking Cosmo to task for promoting a sick woman's weight loss as the main focus. The article's title now: "A Serious Health Scare Helped Me Love My Body More Than Ever." Page Six also notes a line has disappeared that read: "Simone's weight loss success is proof that ANYONE can lose weight without breaking a sweat simply by eating more mindfully—no gym required." (Read about the life of a Cosmo fact-checker.)
Original Summary:  Cosmopolitan's Twitter feed included a post about a possible Gilmore Girls revival, as well as tweets about women using tampons for makeup and a weight loss story that sparked controversy. The article in question, titled "How This Woman Lost 44 Pounds Without Any Exercise," documented the story of Simone Harbinson, an Australian mom who suffered from appendix cancer and gained 35 pounds as a result of her illness and surgeries. Despite her condition, Harbinson was able to lose the weight through meal-prepping and a nutrition program, resulting in a 44-pound weight loss. However, some critics accused Cosmopolitan of promoting a sick woman's weight loss as the main focus of the article, with some arguing that it was insensitive to feature a cancer survivor's weight loss journey. The article's title has since been changed to "A Serious Health Scare Helped Me Love My Body More Than Ever."

Original Story:  – On the fourth of every month, it's easy to find random "May the Fourth be with you" platitudes on social media from Star Wars superfans—but today's "Force Friday" may even lure Jabba the Hutt onto the Internet or into a store on Tatooine. Just after midnight, five retailers—Target, Walmart, Amazon, Disney Store, and Toys R Us—kicked off a major merchandise event both online and in stores, centered around the December release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the newest movie in the franchise, the Washington Post reports. In addition to new toy and merch lineups, the Force Friday event guide lists plenty of giveaways and Star Wars-themed ceremonies. In New York City, Uber has dispatched a fleet of Dodge Chargers designed to look like Hot Wheels Stormtrooper cars to give Manhattan pedestrians free rides, Mashable reports. Interestingly enough, many of the purchases made during today's event won't be by kids and their parents, but by adult aficionados and collectors, the editor of a toy review website tells the Post—and some don't even want to check out the toys to buy them, but to cull clues about the plotline for the upcoming movie. Even if you don't have any purchasing plans, you can watch as some of the new products are "unboxed" in 15 cities around the world on the YouTube live stream.

Original Story:  – In a wide-ranging interview this week, Donald Trump said the US economy is headed for disaster—unless, it seems, he takes the reins. He also compared himself to the Lone Ranger and predicted the American people will "be falling asleep" if he becomes president. Among the highlights of his Washington Post interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa: The economy is going into a "very massive recession," says Trump, despite popular economic forecasts to the contrary. "It's a terrible time right now" to invest in stocks, he adds. Will his words hurt financial markets? "I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them. I don’t need them." "I'm pessimistic," he says about the economy. "Unless changes are made. Changes could be made. I can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly." Trump says he can wipe away $19 trillion in US debt without gouging the nation's $4 trillion annual budget. "I'm renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that we’re doing so badly on," he explains. (Barry Bennett, a senior Trump advisor, also says Trump could sell off $16 trillion in government assets—although NBC News notes that the US government values its own assets at just $3.2 trillion.) "I bring rage out," Trump says of his combative style. "And after it’s all over, [my opponents] end up being my friends. And I see that happening here." But maybe not his GOP rivals: "I’m not sure they can ever go back to me. I was very rough on Jeb." He used phrases like "Jeb: Low energy. Little Marco," Trump recalls. "Names that were devastating." With his go-it-alone style, is he the Lone Ranger? "I am," he says. "Because I understand life. And I understand how life works. I’m the Lone Ranger." "And after I win, I will be so presidential that you won’t even recognize me. You’ll be falling asleep, you’ll be so bored." In a rare moment, Trump admitted to "a mistake."

Original Story:  – General Electric announced big moves on Monday as part of a strategy to streamline the struggling company, including a rarity: GE is slashing its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression, reports the New York Times. And it's no small cut, with the quarterly payout shrinking by half from 24 cents to 12 cents a share. As CNN Money notes, GE is one of the nation's most widely held stocks, and "countless shareholders, including retirees, rely on the dividend payments." The cut, then, is a sign of how dire things are, and the idea is to free up money to help with the company's transition into a leaner entity, says new CEO John Flannery. Details and developments: Smaller focus: GE plans to zero in on three main industries—aviation, health care, and power, reports the Wall Street Journal. Think jet engines, medical imaging equipment, and generators. It will shed other subsidiaries and lay off 25% of its corporate staff, or about 1,500 jobs at its headquarters in Boston. The board is shrinking from 18 to 12 members. No more lighting? The historic lighting unit is among those likely to be pared, though final decisions await, reports the AP. In all, GE plans to shed $20 billion worth of units in the near future. The railway locomotives unit also is expected to go, and the company may ditch its newly purchased stake in oil and gas giant Baker Hughes. Worst day in years: Shares fell 7.2% on the news, making for GE's worst day on the market since 2009, reports CNBC. The stock was trading at a shade over $19 at the market's close.

Original Story:  – Brett Ratner is responding to at least one of his accusers … with a libel lawsuit. In the suit filed Wednesday in Hawaii, the director says an Oct. 20 Facebook post in which a Hawaii woman claimed Ratner raped her is "entirely false, fabricated, and fictional." He says Melanie Kohler "maliciously" aimed to ruin his reputation when she wrote that Ratner "was a rapist on at least one night in Hollywood about 12 years ago" and "preyed on me as a drunk girl [and] forced himself upon me," per Deadline. Ratner also released a statement Wednesday announcing he is "choosing to personally step away from all Warner Bros.-related activities" because "I don't want to have any possible negative impact to the studio until these personal issues are resolved." Meanwhile, another Hollywood heavyweight hit with sexual misconduct allegations is getting help, per Deadline. Kevin Spacey will "seek evaluation and treatment," a rep said Wednesday, without elaborating. Anthony Rapp was first to accuse Spacey of misconduct, alleging the then-26-year-old made sexual advances toward Rapp when he was 14. Others have since shared similar stories. On Tuesday, film director Tony Montana told Radar that Spacey "put his hand on my crotch forcefully and grabbed my whole package" at a bar in 2003, then followed him into a bathroom. Spacey also allegedly exposed himself to a male bartender at an English hotel in 2010, reports the Sun. The man says Spacey afterward offered his $6,500 watch, apparently "to keep me quiet."

Original Story:  – Well, this part of the Justin Timberlake-Jessica Biel wedding festivities is decidedly less magical: Gawker got hold of a clip from a video that was shown at the $6.5 million nuptials, featuring homeless people and others from the streets of LA wishing the celebrity couple well. The title card read, "Greetings from Your Hollywood Friends Who Just Couldn't Make It." The 8:30 video was made by LA real estate agent Justin Huchel, a longtime friend of Timberlake's. "Funny, funny stuff," deadpans John Cook on Gawker. "Good joke." More reactions: TMZ reads the video not so much as a mockery of homeless people as it is "an obvious dig at Justin and Jessica's ridiculous wealth—juxtaposed against the destitute poverty displayed in the clip." You know you've been naughty when you manage to offend Radar, which calls the video "inappropriate much?" as well as "shockingly insensitive." Twitter criticism has included words like "tacky," "disgusting," and "wrong," the New York Daily News reports. The Huffington Post has more tweets, including this one from VH1: "Yeah, we're sure Jessica Biel was THRILLED about that 'hilarious' homeless people video at her wedding." Huchel's attorney wants the video taken down and is threatening a lawsuit. In a letter to Gawker, he writes, "Mr. Huchel made a video to be used and exhibited privately at Justin Timberlake's wedding as a private joke without Mr. Timberlake's knowledge."

Original Story:  – After what TMZ calls an "absurdly brief gig" in the White House, Anthony Scaramucci may soon be enjoying big bucks from speaking engagements. Scaramucci, who was a White House fixture for less time than it takes for milk to spoil, could be getting a hefty ROI from his short stint as communications director, with "multiple sources plugged into the public speaking circuit" telling TMZ he could command $75,000 for each speaking gig, in no small part due to the drama that surrounded his short tenure. TMZ doesn't think Scaramucci would actually dish on Trump—it notes Scaramucci's apparent loyalty and already fat bank account—but it says he could cash in if he wanted to, especially if he were willing to play the part of "sacrificial lamb." Meanwhile, Vicky Ward of HuffPost spoke with Scaramucci on Tuesday, and he told her "most" of what he said in his infamous call to New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza "was humorous and joking." He also says Lizza threw him under the bus—their families have been friends for more than 50 years, he claims—and that "legally, [the interview] may have been on the record, but the spirit of it was off. And [Lizza] knew that." (Lizza, for his part, tells Ward: "We are not and have never been 'old family friends,' though I think our fathers knew each other.") Scaramucci also revealed his next steps: He's going to "go dark," then "re-emerge—as me." Ward also chatted with Trump surrogate Roger Stone, who told her Trump's administration is "like the French Revolution. You never know who will be beheaded next." (Scaramucci talks about his marital woes and his last hours in the White House here.)

Original Story:  – The Bernie Sanders campaign has launched the most talked-about ad of the 2016 election season to date—"America," set to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's song of the same name. A roundup of coverage: Is it really "the most important campaign ad since President Reagan's 'Morning in America' ad?" This blogger makes the case for the spot at the Hill because of its mixture of "romance" and substance. The Observer suggests that the real meaning of this "bittersweet" protest tune might not be what the Sanders campaign thinks it is. The spot illustrates a contrast in campaigns: Sanders is "pushing inspiration," while Hillary Clinton is "talking in more practical terms." The Christian Science Monitor digs in. This blogger at Gateway Pundit hates it: The first glimpse of a minority comes in the 18th scene. Clinton ally David Brock picks up on that theme, as reported in this AP story. "It seems black lives don't matter much to Bernie Sanders." AdWeek is a fan, especially because of the ad's lack of words, but wonders whether the 1968 song might date the 74-year-old Sanders. As an Iowa resident deluged with ads, Josh Voorhees at Slate is pretty happy with this one, "a welcome break from the usual campaign promises and stale warnings." What do Simon and Garfunkel think? The latter gave his approval, while Simon hasn't commented, reports Variety. The Sanders campaign says the song's use—all properly legal—isn't meant to signal an endorsement from the pair.

Some have called it the most important campaign ad since President Reagan's "Morning in America" ad. The ad mixes "romance" and substance, according to one blogger, while another sees it as a contrast between Sanders' inspiring message and Hillary Clinton's more practical approach. Some have criticized the ad for not featuring any people of color until the 18th scene, with one Clinton ally suggesting that Sanders does not value black lives. Despite some criticism, the ad has been praised by some for its creativity and lack of words.

Original Story:  – There are destructive teen parties where kids punch holes in the walls ... and then there are ones like the one that was broken up in Mill Valley, California, on Sunday morning. It sounds, quite frankly, nuts: Paramedics showed up at the house around 7:30am in response to reports of a seizure, and were promptly attacked by a 16-year-old boy described as having "superhuman strength," reports the Marin Independent Journal. He was covered in blood and reportedly on LSD, according to a lieutenant with the Marin County sheriff's office, who calls it an "LSD party gone bad." The paramedics called the sheriff's office for help; deputies arrived, only to encounter a "combative" girl ... leading them to call for backup. The San Francisco Chronicle reports that there were eventually sheriff's deputies and members of five more law enforcement agencies on the scene, where they found about 10 partiers, many bloodied (the blood was apparently traced to the 16-year-old, who hurt himself while under the influence). The home belonged to the family of one of the girls in attendance; it was for sale, and empty. She was cited, and the boy, along with two 18-year-olds, were hit with charges ranging from being under the influence of an unknown substance to resisting arrest. Pot, cocaine, heroin, and a an Ecstasy-like drug were recovered from the home.

Original Story:  – A New York City woman is receiving both rants and raves for her decidedly bold decision to lure dozens of men to what can only be described as her own self-styled dating game. Per CBS News, the woman, identified in reports as Natasha Aponte, used the dating app Tinder to convince the men to meet her for what they thought was a one-on-one rendezvous in Manhattan's Union Square. But, according to one Twitter user who claims he was among Natasha's marks, that was far from the case. That man, named Spencer, said his interaction with Natasha began with her asking him out to drinks. After flaking out the first time, Spencer said Natasha messaged him a month or so later and invited him to see her friend who was "DJing near Union square" on Saturday. Spencer said he arrived to a stage, their intended meeting point, where dozens of other men were also gathered. To Spencer's shock, the woman he was intending to meet soon stepped onto the stage. "She says 'I've invited you all here for a chance to go on a date with me,'" Spencer wrote. "And proceeds to give a Hunger Games speech about what its gonna take to date her." Despite his annoyance at having been duped, Spencer had to hand it to Natasha. "At that point I am genuinely amazed at the fallopian fortitude this girl possesses," he tweeted. "This is top 10 greatest finesse of all time. Dudes actually stayed and played." Per Gothamist, the game involved men racing each other and doing pushups in a bid to prove their worth. An Instagram purported to be Natasha's describes her as an "Actress, model, singer."

Original Story:  – The buzz around Samantha Bee and the insult she hurled at Ivanka Trump on her show Wednesday night has, not surprisingly, caught the attention of Ivanka's father, CNN notes. On TBS' Full Frontal, Bee had called the younger Trump a "feckless c---" while discussing how "oblivious" she was for tweeting out a pic of herself and her young son while headlines of immigrant parents being separated from their children circulate. On Thursday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called Bee's remark "vile and vicious," and early Friday, the president himself weighed in. "Why aren't they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show?" he tweeted. "A total double standard but that's O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!" USA Today notes his message was similar to that coming from his wife's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, who called it a "double standard" that ABC canceled Roseanne Barr's show over the comedian's racist tweet, but TBS merely apologized for Bee's remark. Matthew Fleischer doesn't think the two are equivalent and explains why in the Los Angeles Times. His upshot: "Equating crudeness with Roseanne's outlandish tweets normalizes racism and anti-Semitism." Meanwhile, some are wondering whether Trump's remarks on Bee are in violation of a federal law prohibiting executive branch members from trying to influence a private entity's employment decisions. (Two sponsors have pulled their ads from Bee's show so far.)

Original Story:  – Looks like Windows 8 is doing little to reboot the market when it comes to laptops and desktops. Global shipments of the machines plummeted 14% in Q1 compared to the year prior, analysts at IDC say, marking the largest drop since its tracking began in 1994. The figures have been cruising downward for four quarters, the firm says. Research rival Gartner saw a slightly smaller drop of 11.2%—still the biggest it has seen since 2001, the Wall Street Journal reports. "The interesting question is how much of this is a structural shift toward slower replacement cycles and more tablets versus how much is people disliking Windows 8," writes Matthew Yglesias at Slate. "The reaction to Windows 8 is real," says an analyst with IDC, which actually assigns some of the slowdown blame to the OS, whose features it describes as confusing to consumers familiar with the traditional PC experience. Further, businesses aren't scrambling to upgrade, he notes. A Gartner analyst, however, believes Windows 8 is "the right direction," and just needs time. Outside the Windows world, analysts had contradictory numbers: Apple's domestic shipments sank 7.5%, according to IDC; Gartner says they climbed 7.4%. (In related news, the Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft is working on a 7-inch Surface tablet to compete with the iPad Mini and Google's 7-inch Nexus.)

Original Story:  – One of the letters was said to have been to Aaron Hernandez's fiancee, a second to his young daughter. But the nature of a third suicide note Hernandez is believed to have left behind remains shrouded in mystery—and now the lawyer of Kyle Kennedy, who says he was a "close friend" of Hernandez in prison, says his client wants that third letter (which he believes was written to him) released, NBC News reports. Attorney Larry Army Jr. also said at a Wednesday presser that Kennedy would eventually reveal the "nature and extent" of his relationship with the ex-Patriots player. But sources tell TMZ the third letter was actually penned to Hernandez's lawyer, Jose Baez, who issued a statement Tuesday via NBC's ProFootballTalk bashing whispers of a letter "to a gay lover, in or out of prison" as "false" and calling the rumors "malicious leaks used to tarnish someone who is dead." Per the Boston Globe, however, Army says the letter may have been written in a kind of prison code, and that his client may have been referred to by his prison nickname. Army also revealed Hernandez had referenced suicide weeks before his death in a different letter to Kennedy, writing, "I think I'm going to hang it up." He adds his client wants a $47,000 watch he says Hernandez gave him, the AP reports. Rumblings about the men's relationship began after a Newsweek story claiming the third letter was left to Hernandez's "prison boyfriend," subsequently ID'd by the Daily Mail as Kennedy, who's serving a sentence for armed robbery. The Worcester County DA's office hasn't been much help, with a rep telling NBC Monday, "The information I have is unclear." Kennedy released a statement with condolences for Hernandez's family, saying, "I miss my friend, Aaron Hernandez," per NBC.
Original Summary:  A third letter believed to have been written by Aaron Hernandez has come to light, with some claiming it was addressed to his fiancee or young daughter, while others believe it was written to a close friend or prison nickname. The letter's contents remain unknown, but the lawyer of one of Hernandez's prison friends, Kyle Kennedy, has come forward to say that his client wants the letter released. Kennedy's lawyer, Larry Army Jr., revealed that Hernandez had referenced suicide in a previous letter to Kennedy, and that his client wants a $47,000 watch that Hernandez gave him. The rumors of a romantic relationship between Hernandez and Kennedy began after a Newsweek story claimed that the third letter was addressed to Hernandez's "prison boyfriend," who has been identified as Kennedy. The Worcester County DA's office has not provided much information on the matter.

But the nature of a third suicide note Hernandez is believed to have left behind remains shrouded in mystery—and now the lawyer of Kyle Kennedy, who says he was a "close friend" of Hernandez in prison, says his client wants that third letter (which he believes was written to him) released, NBC News reports. Attorney Larry Army Jr. also said at a Wednesday presser that Kennedy would eventually reveal the "nature and extent" of his relationship with the ex-Patriots player. But sources tell TMZ the third letter was actually penned to Hernandez's lawyer, Jose Baez, who issued a statement Tuesday via NBC's ProFootballTalk bashing whispers of a letter "to a gay lover, in or out of prison" as "false" and calling the rumors "malicious leaks used to tarnish someone who is dead." Per the Boston Globe, however, Army says the letter may have been written in a kind of prison code, and that his client may have been referred to by his prison nickname. Army also revealed Hernandez had referenced suicide weeks before his death in a different letter to Kennedy, writing, "I think I'm going to hang it up." He adds his client wants a $47,000 watch he says Hernandez gave him, the AP reports.

Original Story:  – "Uncle Aigali," as Kazakhstan's Aigali Supygaliev is known to those close to him, is also known for wandering off from time to time, sometimes for a week or two at a stretch, so when the 63-year-old vanished from his hometown of Tomarly in June, his family waited a whole month before they reported him missing, per the BBC. But bad news soon came via the police, who turned up a charred body and forensic evidence that stated "with 99.2% certainty" that the remains were those of Supygaliev. His brother tells the Azh.kz site, via Sky News, that the family held a wake, buried the body in September, and mourned his loss. Which is why their hearts stopped when Supygaliev nonchalantly strolled through the door two months after he'd been supposedly been interred. Supygaliev's explanation for his absence: He'd met someone at the market in June who offered him work in a neighboring village, so he accepted the job. Meanwhile, the forensic scientist who'd thrown out that 99.2% surety claim on the dead man's DNA simply shrugged and said, "You must never forget that other 0.8%." Supygaliev's family is considering legal action—they're miffed about the money they laid out to bury the body and for the pension funds in Supygaliev's name they'd sent back—and want to identify the person they laid to rest. "Perhaps his family are looking for him," his brother notes. (A "dead man" in Brazil showed up at his own wake.)

Original Story:  – Liberal comedian Marc Maron hit the jackpot on a recent flight when he upgraded to first class … and found himself sitting next to former GOP chairman Ken Mehlman, who recently confirmed he’s gay. Maron live-tweeted the entire experience, starting with a picture of Maron exposing his nipple as Mehlman slept in the background and moving on to paraphrase the political discussion that ensued when Mehlman woke up (“Karl Rove is not evil. He's my friend.”) and, of course, make a few “tea bagging” jokes. Gawker was amused by the whole thing and Punchline Magazine deemed it “hilarious.” Slightly more right-leaning media, however, were not so amused. NewsBusters took Maron to task for “attacking” Mehlman with “gay jokes,” and The Daily Caller didn't seem too happy about the whole thing, either. See all Maron’s tweets here.

Original Story:  – Beyonce not only stole the Super Bowl halftime show from Coldplay with a dazzling performance of her provocative new single "Formation," she made nearly as many headlines as the Denver Broncos' surprise win over the Carolina Panthers. A roundup: Vox looks at how Beyonce—who appeared "flanked by black women back-up dancers with fros and Black Panther-adjacent uniforms"—transformed the event into a "distinctly political act." At Vulture, Lindsay Zoladz looks at just how radical the performance was and declares: "If Trump gets elected, I'm not moving to Canada—I'm moving to Beyonce's utopia." On Saturday, Beyonce surprised everybody by releasing "Formation," her first new song since 2014, along with a stunning video. At the New York Times, critics discussed the song and the video's "high-level, visually striking, Black Lives Matter-era allegory." The Washington Post reports on accusations of plagiarism Beyonce had to deal with before Sunday's show. Before the show, "crazy in love" Jay Z sent his wife 10,000 roses, reports the New York Daily News. An already notorious line from "Formation" has yet to draw a response from Red Lobster, Fader notes. NPR looks at how "Formation"—with vivid imagery that included references to Hurricane Katrina—has already become an "anthem for black women." As if the halftime show, the new single, and the new video weren't enough, the star also announced a "Formation" world tour with a Super Bowl ad, reports Pitchfork. She also announced the #BeyGood initiative to help people affected by the Flint water crisis.

Original Story:  – On Wednesday, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee dropped the kind of bombshell that raises more questions than it answers. USA Today reports Rep. Devin Nunes says he's seen intelligence reports that show communications between President Trump's team and unnamed others were "incidentally collected" by US intelligence officials. Incidental collection is what happens when US citizens happen to be recorded talking to foreign targets of surveillance, according to the Atlantic. Nunes says the surveillance in the reports, which were apparently brought to him by an unnamed source, was not directed at Trump or his team and was both normal and completely legal, CNN reports. "Nothing criminal at all involved," Nunes says. But that didn't stop Nunes from immediately informing the White House and holding a press conference, saying he was "actually alarmed by" the reports. Democrats immediately accused Nunes of blowing "what little credibility he had left" by going to the White House before sharing the reports with the rest of the House Intelligence Committee. In fact, it's unclear if anyone besides Nunes has even seen the reports. Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the committee, says Nunes' actions represent a "profound irregularity" and questions whether Nunes is working for the Trump administration. And while Nunes himself reiterates there was no wiretapping of Trump Tower—by Barack Obama or anybody else—Trump says he now feels "somewhat" vindicated.

Original Story:  – More unfortunate news is streaming out of the now-shuttered Sigma Alpha Epsilon house at the University of Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Daily has uncovered a Vine video from 2013 that appears to show SAE's house mom, Beauton Gilbow, laughing and repeatedly saying the N-word. CBS News describes her as "rapping" the lyrics to a song that includes the word; the Oklahoma City-based Lost Ogle believes it may have been the Trinidad James song "All Gold Everything." Gilbow, 79, yesterday told News9.com that she was "in shock" after watching the video of the racist chant and had "never heard the song." A GoFundMe page set up for her due to the frat's closure has now been taken down. More developments: University President David Boren says all members must be out of their campus home by midnight today. Images show the building tagged with the message "tear it d." "The house will be closed, and as far as I’m concerned it won't be back, at least not as long as I'm president," Boren says, per the Guardian. He adds some members may be expelled. A college football recruit says he will no longer attend OU after watching the "very disturbing" video. "Very uneducated people. I wouldn't want my son or child to go there or to anywhere like that," Texas' Jean Delance tells CBS News. His mom adds, "I've had family history in racial issues, inequality, and Jean knows these things are serious to us." Jean, a junior at North Mesquite High, announced on Twitter that he "officially de-committed" from Oklahoma and would be "opening my recruitment due to personal reasons." He says he has already been offered a spot at the University of Alabama, where SAE was in fact founded. Yesterday, the Unheard Movement, the black student group that released the video, led a protest march on campus and was joined by Boren, the Oklahoma football team, and many other students, reports USA Today. The paper notes about 5% of the university's student body is African-American.

Original Story:  – Herman Cain, the GOP candidate for the 2012 presidential nomination and ex-CEO of Godfather's Pizza, showed a depressing knowledge gap yesterday when Chris Wallace asked him about the Palestinian "right of return" on Fox News Sunday. He "stumbled hard," reports Fox News, and twice haltingly called it "something ... that should be negotiated." A few reactions: Though he did share some accurate points on the Middle East, Ross Kaminsky writes for The American Spectator, the gaffe "shows an extremely superficial connection with a huge foreign policy issue." Even harsher, Jay Bookman for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution says Cain has forfeited "any claim as a legitimate candidate. ... As with the Afghanistan issue, it reflects not merely a lack of knowledge, but even worse, a basic lack of interest and respect for the high office that he seeks." Nonsense, writes Jim Geraghty over at Campaign Spot. "The idea that he’s committed some sort of epic gaffe ... strikes me as pretty weak tea." He continues: "Most Americans don’t pay much attention to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict," and Republicans heavily favor the Israelis anyway, so even though the left is tearing into Cain, it's likely the 'gaffe' "will not cost Cain a single vote."

Original Story:  – In his first full interview, Amy Winehouse's brother Alex reveals what he thinks really killed the singer: bulimia. She began suffering from the eating disorder in her late teens and was never able to free herself from it, he tells the Guardian. "We all knew she was doing it, but it's almost impossible [to tackle], especially if you're not talking about it. It's a real dark, dark issue," he says. "She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia ... I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger." He also recalls the time his "really drunk" sister ruined his 30th birthday party. "She was head-butting people, but she's only little, she's tiny, so it's like swatting away a fly, but it was no good. I had a go at her, threw out some home truths," he says. "The problem with being [famous] is—how many people tell you 'No'?" The interview comes as a London museum prepares to open an exhibit, co-curated by Alex, on Winehouse and her family.

Original Story:  – She apologized privately. Now, after allegedly pushing her friend off a 60-foot bridge in Washington state, 18-year-old Taylor Smith is doing so publicly. The teen tells NBC News she "feels really bad about what happened" at Moulton Falls Regional Park on Aug. 7, when authorities say Smith pushed 16-year-old Jordan Holgerson, causing her to belly-flop into the water below. Holgerson's mother tells the Longview Daily News her daughter is out of the hospital but still in "a lot of pain" from injuries, including six broken ribs and two punctured lungs. NBC reports Holgerson also suffered other internal injuries and a mass behind her windpipe. A GoFundMe page has raised more than $3,000 to cover "outstanding" medical expenses. Meanwhile, the Clark County Sheriff's Office announced Tuesday it had wrapped up an investigation in which Smith cooperated. The county prosecutor's office will now decide if charges should be filed. In a text to NBC, Smith said she was keeping away from home because of threats but had repeatedly apologized to Holgerson. Holgerson, however, says she received a single apology via text. "[Smith] messaged Jordan to say 'sorry' but nobody thinks it was a sincere apology," a source close to the teen tells the Sun, adding "Taylor hasn't been to visit Jordan to see if she is OK."

The teen tells NBC News she "feels really bad about what happened" at Moulton Falls Regional Park on Aug. 7, when authorities say Smith pushed 16-year-old Jordan Holgerson, causing her to belly-flop into the water below. Holgerson's mother tells the Longview Daily News her daughter is out of the hospital but still in "a lot of pain" from injuries, including six broken ribs and two punctured lungs. NBC reports Holgerson also suffered other internal injuries and a mass behind her windpipe. A GoFundMe page has raised more than $3,000 to cover "outstanding" medical expenses. Meanwhile, the Clark County Sheriff's Office announced Tuesday it had wrapped up an investigation in which Smith cooperated. The county prosecutor's office will now decide if charges should be filed. In a text to NBC, Smith said she was keeping away from home because of threats but had repeatedly apologized to Holgerson. Holgerson, however, says she received a single apology via text. "[Smith] messaged Jordan to say 'sorry' but nobody thinks it was a sincere apology," a source close to the teen tells the Sun, adding "Taylor hasn't been to visit Jordan to see if she is OK."

Original Story:  – One more sign that climbing Everest just ain't what it used to be: When a British mountaineer got to the summit over the weekend, he pulled out his smartphone and gave the BBC a video billed as "the world's first live video call ... from the rooftop of the world." Now Nepal tourism officials are in a huff because he didn't clear it beforehand, reports AFP. "Even the tourism ministry has to seek permission from the communication ministry to film, broadcast, or conduct media related events on Everest," says one. The climber, incidentally, was one of nearly 150 people who reached the summit on Sunday alone. One critic thinks all these inexperienced hikers are making a mess of the mountain, though there have been some nice milestones of late—along with a sherpa fight.
Original Summary:  A British mountaineer recently called the BBC from the summit of Mount Everest using his smartphone, sparking controversy among Nepalese officials. The climber did not obtain permission from the authorities before making the live video call, which is required by law. Nearly 150 people reached the summit on the same day, with some critics expressing concerns about the increasing number of inexperienced hikers on the mountain. Despite this, there have been some positive developments, including milestones and a sherpa fight. The incident highlights the challenges of managing the world's highest mountain and the growing interest in climbing it.

Original Story:  – How do you soothe an angry shark? You can rock him to near-submission with heavy metal. That's what one Australian charter boat operator has discovered after witnessing sharks blissfully rubbing their snouts against caged underwater speakers belting out the sounds. "I guess the visual people expect is that of a shark with long hair kind of headbanging past the cage doing the air guitar," Matt Waller told Australian Geographic. "But, of course, sharks don't actually have ears, and it's the frequency and vibration they're after." Waller experimented with different music to see what might attract sharks so tourists on his boat can get a close-up look at the creatures. He found heavy metal worked better than chum. So far, Waller has tested "Back in Black" and "You Shook Me All Night Long" by AC/DC. Next on his underwater playlist will be tunes by Led Zeppelin, the White Stripes, and Ozzy Osbourne. NPR music maestro Lars Gotrich has five other specific suggestions for tunes for all you angry Jaws out there. Check them out here.

Original Story:  – "I gave that newscast every single shred of hope and love I had for Jacob," KARE's Jana Shortal writes on Facebook. "You made it about my pants." Shortal reported on the final moments of 11-year-old kidnapping and sexual abuse victim Jacob Wetterling's life on Tuesday. The next day, the Star Tribune ran a piece by gossip columnist CJ (she doesn't use her real name) titled "Shortal flubbed fashion statement during Wetterling report." According to City Pages, CJ took issue with Shortal's "skinny jeans." "I was among a number of media types who found them inappropriate," City Pages quotes the now-deleted column as saying. "I would think that hipness wouldn’t be a priority while covering one of the biggest, saddest stories in Minnesota history." While CJ called Shortal's outfit "unseemly" and "perhaps disrespectful," many more people thought those words better described CJ's column. Minnesota Public Radio called the column "indecent" and "cruel." Jezebel says Shortal was "chastised for the clothing she chose to wear while doing her goddamn job." And City Pages accuses CJ of "judging (and shaming) a woman in the spotlight simply for how she dressed." The Star Tribune itself, in a tweet apologizing to Shortal and readers, calls the column "inappropriate" and "insensitive." In her Facebook response to CJ, Shortal writes she was focusing on Jacob and wearing what she always wears, but "you wrote about clothes in the darkest moment of Minnesota news history." (Female television hosts told to lose weight or lose their jobs.)
Original Summary:  KARE's Jana Shortal was criticized by a gossip columnist for wearing "skinny jeans" while reporting on the kidnapping and sexual abuse of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling. The column was widely criticized, with many finding it inappropriate and insensitive to focus on Shortal's clothing during such a tragic event. The Star Tribune apologized for the column, calling it "inappropriate" and "insensitive." Shortal responded on Facebook, stating that she was focused on the story and wore what she always wears, but the columnist chose to focus on her clothing instead. The incident highlights the double standards faced by female television hosts, who are often judged on their appearance rather than their reporting.

Original Story:  – Elon Musk has a word of caution for anyone who envies his lifestyle. "I don't think you'd necessarily want to be me," he told podcaster Joe Rogan in an interview that lasted more than two hours. "I don't think people would like it that much." One big reason is that his brain is "a never-ending explosion" of ideas that he finds hard to turn off, per CNN. Musk touched on all manner of things in the interview, but he's drawing the most attention for taking a puff of a marijuana-tobacco joint handed to him by Rogan. Related coverage, including the departure of two high-ranking Tesla execs: The pot: "I mean it's legal, right?" asked Musk in accepting the joint. (The interview was done in California, where recreational pot is, in fact, legal. See the pot-smoking here.) Musk, though, says he almost never indulges in the stuff. "I don't find that it's very good for productivity," he said. "It is sort of like a cup of coffee in reverse." Musk also had some whiskey during the interview. Questionable? A story at the Wall Street Journal sees the public puff as "jarring" given the context: It "involved the chief executive of a large publicly traded corporation, but also one who is under immense scrutiny for his occasional public outbursts." 2 big departures: The interview is out along with news that Tesla's chief accountant quit just a month into the job, reports Business Insider. However, Dave Morton said he's leaving only because the pace and the public scrutiny are more intense than he expected. "I believe strongly in Tesla, its mission, and its future prospects, and I have no disagreements with Tesla's leadership or its financial reporting." Meanwhile, Bloomberg reports that human resources chief Gaby Toledano will not return from a leave of absence that began last month.
Original Summary:  Elon Musk has warned that his lifestyle may not be desirable to others, as his brain is constantly filled with ideas that he finds hard to turn off. During an interview with Joe Rogan, Musk smoked a marijuana-tobacco joint, despite rarely indulging in the substance due to its lack of productivity. The CEO of Tesla also revealed that the company's chief accountant quit just a month into the job due to the intense pace and public scrutiny, while the human resources chief is also not returning from a leave of absence. Musk's public puff of marijuana has been deemed "jarring" given the context, particularly as the CEO of a large publicly traded corporation under scrutiny.

Original Story:  – In his final weeks in office, will President Obama finally sign onto a bid to create our own Death Star? Or how about deporting Justin Bieber? Those were two of some 5,000 petitions sent to the White House via the "We the People" site over the past five years, reports the Los Angeles Times. While most bids have gone nowhere, such as a pitch to recognize International Talk Like a Pirate Day, others resulted in presidential support for significant issues like state laws banning gay conversion therapy. An analysis by the Pew Research Center showed the most common petitions concerned health care (8%); disease awareness (6%); veterans’ issues (6%); immigration (5%); creating new holidays (5%); criminal investigations (5%); and animal rights (5%). Here are the top five since the website launched in 2011: "Legally recognize the Westboro Baptist Church as a hate group," 367,180 signatures. "Establish justice and prevent a great catastrophe," 331,914 signatures. (This was over a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, per Storify.) "File charges against the 47 US senators in violation of the Logan Act in attempting to undermine a nuclear agreement," 322,117 signatures. "Ask President Obama to appear on HBO’s ‘Real Time with Bill Maher,’" 314,226 signatures. (Obama did appear.) "Deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card," 273,698 signatures.

Original Story:  – Since the time he was a much younger man, Christopher Petronino has been exploring a cave at Split Rock Reservoir in Rockaway Township, NJ. On Sunday, the 50-year-old Boy Scout troop leader decided to show the cave he first entered some three decades ago to his son and the two other scouts he was hiking with. He began to enter feet-first through the crevasse-type entrance—when a black bear seized his foot. The New York Times reports the animal pulled Petronino into the cave and began biting him. That was just the start of the ordeal. NJ.com reports that Petronino twice struck the bear in the head with a rock hammer then told the boys to call 911. He assumed a fetal position with his back to the bear and put a sweatshirt over his head, reports NBC New York. The boys did call, but were unable to provide their location to the 911 operator; officials began to try to track their coordinates and dispatched a helicopter. Petronino next told the boys to place the food they were carrying just outside the cave. That was enough to get the bear to emerge, and a dog that was with the group then scared the bear off. All told, Petronino spent "a substantial amount of time" with the "huffing" bear in the cave, before emerging and himself calling 911. Help arrived 80 minutes later, and he was airlifted out, says a rep for the state's Department of Environmental Protection. Petronino suffered bites to his scalp and legs; the boys were unharmed. Officials are now trying to trap the bear, which they believe "was protecting its hibernation location ... they do not, at this point, consider the bear to be a Category I bear," meaning one that must be euthanized.

Original Story:  – As House lawmakers contended with more chaos on the Iran nuclear deal today, the supreme leader of Iran was busy making his own statements that appear to squash any hopes of Iran trying to mend its delicate relationship with the US via the deal, per the Times of Israel. Instead, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei took to Twitter to first threaten Israel and then to send the US a pointed message or two. "After negotiations, in Zionist regime they said they had no more concern about Iran for next 25 years," the tweet read. "I'd say … you will not see next 25 years. … Until then, struggling, heroic and jihadi morale will leave no moment of serenity for Zionists." As the Times points out, the statement was juxtaposed over a picture of someone (ostensibly Khamenei) walking over an image of an Israeli flag painted on the sidewalk. Khamenei didn't quit there, reiterating other messages he reportedly made in a speech in Tehran, CBS News notes. He seemed to close the door on future talks with the US about other topics, stressing, "We allowed negotiation with US only on nuclear issue for certain reasons, in other areas we did not and will not allow negotiations with US," adding that "[US] negotiation is means of infiltration and imposition of their wills." He then rubbed salt in the wound, finishing up with: "We would negotiate and reach agreement in different levels of 'state, religion or ethnic groups' with all countries but the Great Satan," using the epithet bestowed on America by his predecessor, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. (He's gone off on this subject before.)

Original Story:  – “Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have ever been done to prevent this, we call BS,” Emma Gonzalez said Saturday at a gun-control rally in Florida. “They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS. They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun. We call BS." Vox reports the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student and survivor of Wednesday's school shooting in Parkland that left 17 dead called for tougher gun laws and called out President Trump and the NRA. "If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and ... how nothing is going to be done about it, I'm going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association," AFP quotes Gonzalez as saying. Gonzalez's speech, in which she cried shame on "every politician taking donations from the NRA," quickly went viral on social media. She noted that the NRA spent $30 million helping get Trump elected. "Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?" Gonzalez asked. Elsewhere, a prominent Republican donor says he will no longer fund candidates or groups that don't support a ban on assault weapons, the New York Times reports. "Enough is enough," says Al Hoffman Jr., who has given millions of dollars to Republican candidates and causes. That feeling wasn't shared at a large gun show taking place Saturday just 50 miles from Parkland, according to NBC News. A man who was helping his friend buy an AR-15 said he thinks there's "more than enough gun control" already.
Original Summary:  Emma Gonzalez, a survivor of the Parkland school shooting, spoke at a gun-control rally and criticized politicians who accept NRA funding while claiming nothing can be done to prevent shootings. She called out President Trump and the NRA, asking how much they have received from the organization. Gonzalez also noted that the NRA spent $30 million to help elect Trump. A prominent Republican donor has announced he will no longer fund candidates or groups that do not support a ban on assault weapons. Despite this, a man at a nearby gun show disagreed, believing there is already enough gun control in place.

Gonzalez's speech, in which she cried shame on "every politician taking donations from the NRA," quickly went viral on social media. She noted that the NRA spent $30 million helping get Trump elected. "Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?" Gonzalez asked. Elsewhere, a prominent Republican donor says he will no longer fund candidates or groups that don't support a ban on assault weapons, the New York Times reports. "Enough is enough," says Al Hoffman Jr., who has given millions of dollars to Republican candidates and causes. That feeling wasn't shared at a large gun show taking place Saturday just 50 miles from Parkland, according to NBC News. A man who was helping his friend buy an AR-15 said he thinks there's "more than enough gun control" already.
Injected Summary:  Emma Gonzalez, a survivor of the Parkland school shooting, spoke at a gun-control rally and criticized politicians who accept NRA funding while claiming nothing can be done to prevent shootings. She called out President Trump and the NRA, asking how much they have received from the organization. Gonzalez's speech went viral and a prominent Republican donor has announced he will no longer fund candidates or groups that don't support a ban on assault weapons. Despite this, a man at a nearby gun show disagreed and believed there is already enough gun control in place.

Original Story:  – What should have been the happiest day of his life now has a Georgia man facing prison. Hours after her Dec. 29 wedding near Atlanta, Kali Dobson was killed in a car crash; new husband Ryan Quinton was behind the wheel, and told police he swerved to avoid a dog. The car flew down an embankment and Dobson, who wasn't wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the car—which read "Just Married" on the rear—before it came to rest on top of her, killing her, police say. Now Quinton, who police say had a BAC of 0.114, has been charged with DUI, vehicular homicide, weaving over a roadway, and reckless driving. But the bride's mom says the move is anything but comforting. "He is my son and a brother to my daughters now and an uncle to my grandbabies," she tells the Marietta Daily Journal. "We can't stand to see something happen to him. We're behind him. Whatever it takes, we're right there for him." Quinton, 28, has since been released on a $25,000 bond. A witness who found a bloodied Quinton searching for help told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution he was "hysterical." Things only got worse when the bridal party arrived, still in their dresses. "There was nothing that could be done," the witness said, per the New York Daily News. "The car was on top of her. You couldn't even see her."

Original Story:  – The battle for Iraq is getting uncomfortably close to its capital city. Islamic State of Iraq and Syria militants briefly took over parts of the city of Baquba, which is just 37 miles from Baghdad, the BBC reports. The Iraqi military and allied Shiite militias eventually drove them off—and killed 28 rebels in the process, an official tells the Wall Street Journal. During the battle 44 prisoners at a police station were also killed, though by whom is unclear. Nouri al-Maliki's office blamed militants, but other officials said security forces killed the prisoners as they tried to escape. Baquba residents are frightened, sources say, and many are fleeing the city. Government fighters are combing the city for ISIS holdouts. There has also been fighting on two major highways leading into Baghdad. Meanwhile, inside Baghdad, four young men believed to be Sunnis were found dead in a predominantly Shiite neighborhood, the New York Times reports. Each had been shot numerous times, in murders reminiscent of death squad killings that were common in 2006 and 2007 Government forces are also fighting to retake Tal Afar, which is west of Mosul. Those forces are massing at the airport in preparation for their next assault, as the government launches airstrikes on the city center. About 700 ISIS fighters are massed there. Iraq's government has openly accused Saudi Arabia of funding ISIS, the Telegraph reports. Riyadh is "siding with terrorism," Maliki's office said in a statement. "The Saudi government should be held responsible for the dangerous crimes committed by these terrorist groups." The US has made a reduction of sectarian tensions in Iraq a prerequisite for aide, but Maliki has done precious little work on that front, the Times reveals today. Instead, Maliki has occupied himself solely with military matters—so much so that his staff has begun wearing fatigues.

Original Story:  – DNA testing has failed to establish a link between a new suspect in the DB Cooper case and the man who vanished after hijacking a plane 40 years ago, the FBI says. DNA from family members of the suspect, who died 10 years ago, failed to match any of the strands of DNA from three different people found on a necktie believed to have been worn by the hijacker, reports the AP. The FBI says it hasn't ruled out the new suspect, however, as there is no proof that any of the DNA on the tie belonged to the hijacker, Reuters notes. "There are some questions about the tie itself," said a special agent. "Was it a used tie, a borrowed tie?" Investigators are working with the suspect's family members to obtain fingerprints to compare to those left behind after the man known as DB Cooper parachuted from a plane with $200,000 in cash.

Original Story:  – Seventy years to the day since the liberation of Auschwitz, some 300 survivors gathered at the infamous Nazi death camp to reflect on the occasion. Candles are being lit at the execution site known as the Death Wall as world leaders attend a ceremony this afternoon. It could be the last time aging survivors are able to gather in such numbers, the BBC reports. Says one 85-year-old of her visits to the camp: "I'll do it for as long as I can. Why? There are still a lot of Holocaust deniers, the world over, and if we don't speak out, the world won't know what happened." The Soviet Union liberated the camp in 1945 and it became a museum two years later. German president Joachim Gauck and French president Francois Hollande will attend the ceremony; political tensions in Ukraine mean Vladimir Putin will not, though AFP reports that he is involved in a ceremony at a Moscow Jewish museum, per the Telegraph. President Obama, meanwhile, is in Saudi Arabia, the Telegraph notes, but a US delegation is being led by Treasury secretary Jack Lew, the AP reports. Steven Spielberg spoke to survivors last night, introduced by 81-year-old survivor Paula Lebovics as "a man who has given us a voice in history," the AP reports. Meanwhile, European leaders are warning against the specter of continuing anti-Semitism: "We've got to fight anti-Semitism and all racism from the outset," said German chancellor Angela Merkel at a Berlin event last night. "We've got to constantly be on guard to protect our freedom, democracy, and rule of law." (Also expected at today's event: The grandson of Auschwitz's commandant.)

Original Story:  – Glenn Beck is probably not a fan of the upcoming Jon Stewart/Stephen Colbert rally as it is—but his head is really “going to explode when he hears this:” President Obama will be a guest on the Daily Show just days before the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. “So much for arguing this rally is not political,” writes Glynnis MacNicol on Mediaite. It's tough not to interpret this as an endorsement on behalf of the president of the United States, MacNicol continues, “and simultaneously a slam against both Glenn Beck and Fox News and in the broader sense against the hyperbolic, race-to-the-bottom coverage Obama has been receiving from various parts of the media.” Obama’s segment—his first on the show as president—will be taped Oct. 27, the New York Times reports; the rally is Oct. 30.

Per the citation, cops found the younger Paul in the driver's seat, acting "belligerent," slurring his words, and sporting "a strong odor of alcohol." A witness told cops the University of Kentucky senior was "revving his engine" moments before "a loud crash." The truck Paul was allegedly driving belongs to someone else, LEX 18 reports. Paul refused a blood test after failing a field sobriety test; he was later taken to the hospital for minor injuries. He's been charged with DUI and failure to maintain required auto insurance. Paul was charged in early 2013 with assaulting a flight attendant, disorderly conduct, public intoxication, and underage consumption of alcohol; later that year he was cited for possession of alcohol at a Kentucky racetrack. A Rand Paul rep said the senator "does not comment on any private matters in regards to his family."

Original Story:  – A boxing ring may be a place of violence, but on Saturday night Indian champion Vijender Singh used one to make a plea for peace. Singh, a former Olympian and current WBO Asia Pacific super middleweight champion, defeated Zulpikar Maimaitiali of China to become the new WBO Oriental super middleweight champion, the Guardian reports. After the fight, though, Singh offered to give his new belt back to Maimaitiali as a gesture of peace between the fighters' two countries, which are currently locked in a territorial dispute in the Himalayas. “I don’t want tension on the border," Singh told the crowd in Mumbai. "It’s a message of peace." The dispute between the world's most-populated countries began in June when the small kingdom of Bhutan, a close ally of India's, discovered Chinese workers extending an unpaved mountain road in a 34-square-mile area where the three countries meet, the New York Times reports. India responded by sending troops and equipment to halt construction, which led to the Chinese government accusing India of infringing on its territory. Troops from the two nuclear nations are now in a standoff just hundreds of feet from one another. On Thursday the Chinese military issued a warning to India that it should not "underestimate the determination and will of the Chinese military to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.”

Original Story:  – An Oklahoma inmate who died after a botched execution was returned to his family and cremated without his heart and larynx, which the office conducting an independent autopsy has decided to keep. Officials say medical examiners can retain tissue indefinitely. "It's not completely unusual," the medical director of a facility that performs independent autopsies tell the AP, explaining that doctors probably found an issue with Clayton Lockett's heart and larynx they want to document. "They might want to do some additional investigation or saw something that was very important to the diagnosis," she says. Lockett died of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after Oklahoma attempted to execute him using a new, three-drug method for the first time. The official cause and manner of his death will be released "very soon" by the Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office, a spokeswoman tells the Tulsa World. The independent autopsy is being conducted in Texas, but the spokeswoman says its findings will be treated as a recommendation, not the final determination of what killed Lockett. After his drawn-out death, an inmate scheduled to die the same night was granted a six-month stay of execution.

Lockett died of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after Oklahoma attempted to execute him using a new, three-drug method. The official cause and manner of his death are expected to be released soon by the Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office. An independent autopsy is being conducted in Texas, but the findings will be treated as a recommendation, not the final determination of what killed Lockett.

Officials say medical examiners can retain tissue indefinitely. "It's not completely unusual," the medical director of a facility that performs independent autopsies tell the AP, explaining that doctors probably found an issue with Clayton Lockett's heart and larynx they want to document. "They might want to do some additional investigation or saw something that was very important to the diagnosis," she says. Lockett died of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after Oklahoma attempted to execute him using a new, three-drug method for the first time. The official cause and manner of his death will be released "very soon" by the Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office, a spokeswoman tells the Tulsa World. The independent autopsy is being conducted in Texas, but the spokeswoman says its findings will be treated as a recommendation, not the final determination of what killed Lockett. After his drawn-out death, an inmate scheduled to die the same night was granted a six-month stay of execution.

Original Story:  – Authorities in Australia say they're "gobsmacked" by the sheer stupidity of a group of men seen swimming to a crocodile trap in Queensland—and getting inside with the bait. The men were spotted getting into the mouth of the trap at the Port Douglas marina, close to where a crocodile is suspected of killing an elderly dementia patient earlier this month, reports the Guardian. "This is incredibly stupid and dangerous behavior," says Julia Leu, a local mayor. "I'm wondering if these fellows are vying for the idiots of the year award or the idiots of the century award." "Srsly? The meat we put in these traps is bait. For crocodiles. Don't swim in them! It's stupid, and illegal," tweeted Queensland Environment Minister Steven Miles. "I've seen some pretty ridiculous things in my time as environment minister, particularly when it comes to crocodiles, but this one takes the cake," he told reporters. He warned that the traps are dangerous even without the crocodiles they're designed to attract. The Queensland government recently introduced a $15,000 fine for interfering with the traps after a similar incident, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports. (This guy was mauled by a crocodile after jumping in a river to prove a point.)

Original Story:  – The horrific murder of four young children in suburban Memphis on Friday is a complete mystery to those who knew Shanynthia Gardner. The 29-year-old is accused of killing 4-year-old Tallen Gardner, 3-year-old Sya Gardner, 2-year-old Sahvi Gardner, and 6-month-old Yahzi Gardner with a butcher knife, the AP reports. A fifth child, 7-year-old Dallen Clayton, managed to escape and his grandmother tells the Commercial Appeal that she knows Gardner as a "beautiful, sweet young lady." "I forgive her," says Sonya Clayton, who is not related to the four younger children. "I know this was not her. I know this was the work of the devil. I love Shanynthia wholeheartedly still." Dallen was unharmed and is currently under protective supervision, People reports. His father, Detrail Clayton, tells the Commercial Appeal that he has known Gardner for 15 years and she has never displayed signs of violence or mental illness. But "when the doors close, you never know what a person is going through," he says. "It's an act of evil. I don't know what she's got into." According to court papers, Gardner told her husband, Martin Gardner, that she had killed their four children. Police found her at the scene with "superficial cuts to her neck and wrists." Gardner has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. According to a police document, there were signs of trouble last year: One day last March, she picked her kids up early and drove 100 miles to Corinth, Miss., for no apparent reason. "She has been feeling that someone is trying to harm her and her family," the police report states.

Original Story:  – Donald Trump has little interest in making his tax returns public, but the Washington Post reports that he once had to do so back in 1981 because he was applying for a casino license. The bottom line? He paid $0 in federal taxes because he claimed a combined income from 1978 and 1979 of a negative $3.8 million. Not that he was a pauper: In fact, as the report notes, Trump had previously boasted to the New York Times of being worth around $200 million at the time. He managed to avoid a federal bill by taking advantage of a tax provision used by developers to claim negative income. Might the same still be true today? "Tax analysts say it is possible that Trump pays very low income taxes, or no taxes at all, using tactics available to wealthy investors and developers, such as depreciating the value of real estate," writes the Post's Drew Harwell. That could prove dicey for Trump to explain given his theme of standing up for the little guy against Wall Street fatcats who take advantage of tax loopholes to "get away with murder." Meanwhile, USA Today did a deep dive into Trump's businesses and found that they've "been involved in at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe."

Original Story:  – Roy Moore and Doug Jones have cast their respective votes in the Alabama Senate race, and the rest of the state must wrap things up before the polls close at 8pm Eastern. Moore made a few last-minute headlines by riding to his voting site on his horse, Sassy, notes the Hill. Polls remain tight, with Moore hanging on to a slight edge of about 2 points in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. Still, as FiveThirtyEight notes, this race has been difficult to poll for various reasons, and the difference right now falls within the statistical margin of error. It's doubtful the race will be called early, especially if turnout is relatively heavy, as expected, notes Al.com. Politico highlights some keys to the race: If Jones hopes to win, he'll need to get heavy turnout from black voters, while Moore can counter that with heavy turnout among rural conservatives. One big X factor, however: whether write-in votes will hurt Moore. CNN, meanwhile, observes that the key for both candidates might be performing well in Mobile. The city is home to "scores of more affluent, moderate, business-type Republicans—that is, those most likely to abandon Moore and vote for Jones, write in someone else or stay home altogether."
Original Summary:  Roy Moore and Doug Jones have cast their votes in the Alabama Senate race, with Moore riding his horse to the polling station. The race is tight, with Moore leading by about 2 points according to polls, but the margin of error is within the statistical range. The outcome is uncertain and may depend on heavy turnout from certain demographics, such as black voters for Jones and rural conservatives for Moore. Write-in votes could also play a significant role. The performance of the candidates in Mobile, a city with affluent and moderate Republicans, may be crucial.

Original Story:  – A Black Lives Matter protester locked horns with Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Birmingham, Ala., on Saturday, and neither one of them emerged very happy from the encounter, reports the Washington Post. Mercutio Southall Jr., who the Post describes as a well-known activist and the founder of the Birmingham chapter of Black Lives Matter, began chanting at a Trump rally, prompting Trump to tell security to "Get him the hell out of here, will you, please?" A scuffle apparently ensued as security moved to remove Southall, cell phone video was recorded, and Southall emerged saying that he had been roughed up considerably as well as been called racial slurs. A woman in the video shouts repeatedly, "don't choke him!" "I got punched in the face, I got punched in the neck. I got kicked in the chest. Kicked in the stomach. Somebody stepped on my hand," Southall tells CNN. A Trump rep on Saturday said "the campaign does not condone this behavior," but Trump himself appeared less apologetic in comments Sunday, per CNN. Southall "was so obnoxious and so loud, he was screaming. I had 10,000 people in the room yesterday, 10,000 people, and this guy started screaming by himself and they—I don't know, rough up, he should have been—maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing," Trump said. Southall, for his part, says he intends to press charges.

Original Story:  – The Free Syrian Army has warned the Syrian government it will renew its fight to overthrow Bashar al-Assad's regime unless it complies with the United Nations peace plan by lunchtime tomorrow. The rebel group, which controls parts of some towns and cities as well as large areas of countryside, urged the government to "implement an immediate ceasefire, withdraw its troops, tanks and artillery from Syrian cities and villages," and allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians, the BBC reports. If the government fails to act, "we are free from any commitment and we will defend and protect the civilians, their villages and their cities," the rebel group's leader said. Both sides have violated the ceasefire over the last two months, but UN observers say the Syrian regime is the worst offender by far, Reuters notes. As civil war looms, Russia has warned that it is "categorically against" foreign military intervention and said it would be "premature" for the UN to take any further steps to stem the violence.

A teen girl getting horse-riding lesson nearby reportedly witnessed flames coming from the train before it overturned, the Independent reports. Both the Guardian and BBC say the death toll in the crash is at least 10. And according to the Guardian, more than 30 people were injured—12 of them seriously. Everyone aboard the train at the time of the crash was an employee of the railway operator. Officials blame the crash on "excessive speed," the BBC reports. Though it's unclear why the train was going so fast, according to the Guardian. The AP reports there is no indication the crash had anything to do with the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday. The Strasbourg-to-Paris line is scheduled to open next year, according to the BBC.

Original Story:  – In Saudi Arabia, women are hamstrung from doing certain tasks many of us take for granted—including marrying and vacationing abroad—without permission from their male guardians. Now, more than 14,000 Saudi women are trying to change that with a petition to the government that they hope will put an end to the conservative Islamic kingdom's guardianship system, the BBC reports. Women currently need an OK from a husband, father, brother, son, or other male family member to do not only the previously listed activities, but also more routine things such as renting an apartment, getting a passport, accessing health care—sometimes even taking a class or getting a job. "Women should be treated as [full citizens]," activist Aziza Al-Yousef, who's been in the equal-rights fight for 10 years, tells the Guardian. The movement to dump guardianship picked up steam in July after a Human Rights Watch report came out on the system and the hashtag #IAmMyOwnGuardian started proliferating on social media. Not all women are against guardianship, with a female columnist for the Arab News saying that while reform to the system is needed, how well the system works depends on each family's dynamic, and that women who live under such systems aren't necessarily "brainwashed." Still, an HRW researcher calls the drive to nix guardianship "incredible and unprecedented." "[The women have] made undeniably clear they won't stand to be treated as second-class citizens any longer," she tells the BBC. (An unveiled anchorwoman caused a hubbub.)

Original Story:  – Looking for something a little more brainy than Twilight this weekend? Well, a new adaptation of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is also hitting theaters, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley, but critics are divided on the result. Everyone agrees it looks great, but many believe it lacks heart. Here's a taste of what people are saying: "You know there is something seriously wrong with Anna Karenina when you start rooting for the train," writes Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle. Wright "made the movie he wanted to make, and he made it well," but he took such pains to distance his audience from the proceedings that we never connect emotionally. "The result is a beautiful disaster." It's a "dazzling but only partly coherent confection," writes Andrew O'Hehir of Salon, who's impressed by "how much of Tolstoy’s spirit they actually pack into the damn thing." Knightley has evolved beyond the "upper-crust ingénue type with a bone structure made for the movie screen" she started her career as; her Anna "is a complicated, powerful, and vulnerable character." Wright's conceit of staging Karenina like a stage play is "a dazzling gambit, filmed with confidence and craft," writes Ty Burr of the Boston Globe. "It also wears out its welcome in about five minutes." The problem is that Wright—who's "on record as saying naturalism is for sissies, more or less"—can't just cut loose like, say, Baz Luhrmann in Moulin Rouge. "He's a tasteful revolutionary." AO Scott at the New York Times thought it was "brilliant," compressing Tolstoy's "loose and baggy monster of a novel" into "a frantic and sublime opera." But even he admits that it lacks "the deep, resonant note of tragedy" that would take it from very good to great. "You may be dazzled … but really, you should feel as if you had been hit by a train."
Original Summary:  Anna Karenina, a new adaptation of Tolstoy's novel, has been released and is receiving mixed reviews. While some critics praise the film's visuals and staging, others feel that it lacks emotional depth. The film, directed by Joe Wright, is staged like a play and features Keira Knightley in the lead role. Some critics have praised Knightley's performance, but others feel that the film's attempt to distance the audience from the story makes it difficult to connect emotionally. Despite the mixed reviews, many agree that the film is visually stunning and a dazzling adaptation of Tolstoy's novel.

Well, a new adaptation of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is also hitting theaters, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley, but critics are divided on the result. Everyone agrees it looks great, but many believe it lacks heart. Here's a taste of what people are saying: "You know there is something seriously wrong with Anna Karenina when you start rooting for the train," writes Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle. Wright "made the movie he wanted to make, and he made it well," but he took such pains to distance his audience from the proceedings that we never connect emotionally. "The result is a beautiful disaster." It's a "dazzling but only partly coherent confection," writes Andrew O'Hehir of Salon, who's impressed by "how much of Tolstoy’s spirit they actually pack into the damn thing."

Original Story:  – An escaped inmate accused of raping and murdering a woman last year was shot and killed in Mississippi on Thursday by the very people he had taken prisoner. Officials say Rafael McCloud, 34—who escaped from a Warren County jail on March 2 with a worker's uniform—was killed by the couple he was holding hostage in a Vicksburg home. Police chief Walter Armstrong tells CBS News that McCloud entered the home through a garage door around 4am Thursday and fought a man and woman who were home with their 5-year-old son. The man was stabbed in the shoulder and his wife was hit in the head before both were tied up in a bathroom, reports the Vicksburg Post. Around 7am, however, the woman either was allowed to leave the room or she freed herself, but either way, she returned with a gun. Police say she fired one shot she thought hit McCloud, then untied her husband, who fired several more shots. The family then flagged down a passing motorist who called 911. Police found McCloud dead in the tub with multiple bullet wounds. "This community has really been frightened for over a week, and that has come to an end," Armstrong says, calling the couple's treatment "torture." McCloud, who was indicted in January, escaped from jail after cornering a jail worker with a shank and walked out with a uniform, keys, and radio. A day later, police found the uniform pants at the abandoned hospital where he allegedly killed Sharon Wilson, 69. Cops are now investigating if McCloud had help on the run. "He had on a nice white pair of tennis shoes, and he had jeans on that he didn't have when he left jail," Armstrong says. "The shoes looked to be the exact size he wears."

Original Story:  – Consumers are planning to flock to one of a half-dozen Apple stores around the globe today—and not to wait in line for the latest gadget. Protests are set to hit "marquee locations" in Washington, DC; New York City, San Francisco, London, Sydney, and Bangalore. The gripe? The way Apple's foreign suppliers—particularly frequently-in-the-press Foxconn—treat their workers. CNN explains that the protests were born from two online petitions, one at Change.org (just shy of 200,000 signatures) and one at SumOfUs.org (about 57,000). While those numbers are sizable, the gathered masses will be significantly smaller: A Change.org organizer expects about 40 people to show at Apple's Grand Central Terminal store, where they will deliver hard copies of the petitions at 10am ET. Among the groups' demands: an "ethical iPhone," the creation of a "worker protection strategy," and the revelation of any findings made by the independent watchdog Fair Labor Association. A Change.org rep tells the Washington Post that the protests were never intended to be massive: The point, she says, is just to make sure Apple is aware of its customers' concerns.

Original Story:  – The tragedy is extreme—now 10 people dead after being contained in a stiflingly hot tractor-trailer parked at a San Antonio Walmart—and so too is the potential sentence for James M. Bradley Jr. In advance of his Monday appearance in federal court, the 60-year-old driver of the truck was charged with transporting immigrants in the US illegally—a charge that could carry the death penalty, reports the AP. The San Antonio Express-News explains that the law allows the penalties to be elevated when a human smuggling operation ends in death. The latest: The victims: The Express-News reports all the casualties are adult males. The ordeal: The federal complaint says the immigrants' destination via the truck was San Antonio, and that breathing issues set in about an hour in. The passengers reportedly took turns breathing through a hole in the pitch-black trailer and pounded on its walls in a futile attempt to get Bradley's attention. The AP notes that San Antonio sits about 150 miles from the border. Bradley's story: He says he had no idea there were people in the truck, per court docs that quote a Homeland Security Investigations agent. Bradley says he got out at Walmart to use the bathroom, heard the banging, opened the door, "and was surprised when he was run over by 'Spanish' people and knocked to the ground." He told authorities the trailer had been sold and his boss asked him to drive it from Iowa to Brownsville, Texas. What Bradley said in court: Nothing, per the AP. He faces another hearing Thursday. More to prosecute: Acting ICE Director Thomas Homan earlier said the truck likely picked up the illegal immigrants once they were in the US, reports the AP. "Even though they have the driver in custody, I can guarantee you there's going to be many more people we're looking for to prosecute," he said. Similar case: The tragedy calls to mind another from 2003, in which 19 people died inside a truck in Texas. The Washington Post looks back at all the steps leading to that disaster. Temperatures inside the trailer hit 173 degrees. Words of comfort, outrage: The Express-News rounds up statements from a slew of prominent Texans. Two cents: The Express-News editorial board weighs in: "Imagine if there were a functional—legal—mechanism for such immigrants to come here. ... The current system is broken. ... The laws, as currently enforced, set a premium on punishing the immigrants but leaving employers virtually alone. ... Comprehensive reform could fix all this. Yet, Congress is more interested in punishment than fixes," they writing, citing recent sanctuary city-related moves. So what is happening at the border? Apprehensions are sharply down, and have been trending down for five months, reports USA Today: 21,659 people got sent back or were arrested along the US-Mexico border last month, which is less than half of what we saw a year prior. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly attributed the drop to President Trump's policies and rhetoric.

Original Story:  – Imagine being a 4-year-old boy who loves dinosaurs, digging in the dirt, and spending time with your dad. For Wylie Brys, those three passions intertwined for the best day ever last September when he made an astounding discovery behind a shopping center in Mansfield, Texas: the fossil of what scientists believe could be a 100-million-year-old dino, the Dallas Morning News reports. Scientists from Southern Methodist University helped extract the fossil this week, seven months after Wylie's find, and they think it could be that of a land-dwelling nodosaur, a pony-sized creature that one SMU researcher tells the newspaper was like an "armored beach [ball] that floated out to sea." "Quite rare to find a dinosaur in this area," another SMU scientist adds. "We were finding some fish vertebrae in the hillside, and then Wiley walked a little ways ahead of me and came back with a piece of bone," dad Tim Brys tells NBC 5 of his son's fateful find. "And I paused and was like, 'OK, where did you find this?'" It took all this time since to get paperwork in place for the dig, which was facilitated by the Dallas Zoo, where Brys works. The fossils were placed into a burlap-and-plaster protective wrap and will be taken to SMU, where they'll undergo a months-long cleaning process before researchers can start to more fully scrutinize them. And if Brys and Wylie—who has since turned 5, as per the Washington Post—hadn't gone on their dad-and-son dig last fall? "It would have been buried and never been discovered in our lifetime," an SMU scientist tells the Dallas Morning News. (A dino found in Venezuela apparently survived a horrific extinction.)

Original Story:  – Teacher Linda McLean says she hasn't been able to work since the terrifying Friday two years ago when a man wearing goggles burst into her classroom, pointed a pistol in her face, pulled the trigger, and told her, "You're dead." But she wasn't shot: The gunman turned out to be the school district's safety officer, conducting a surprise "active shooter" drill on a day when students were at home, the Oregonian reports. McLean is suing the school district in Halfway, Ore., the principal, and several other parties over the drill, seeking lost pay, medical costs, and punitive damages, reports NBC News. According to her lawsuit, she tried to go back to the school the Monday after the drill but became "extremely emotionally and physically ill" and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. The drill at Pine Eagle School District No. 61 came just a few months after the Sandy Hook massacre, and "panic ensued," according to McLean's lawsuit. She says that when the safety officer and a school board member went room to room firing blanks, one teacher wet herself and another was injured in a scuffle, the Oregonian reports. The 56-year-old's lawsuit states that being "assaulted and terrorized by a man armed with a gun lies well outside the scope" of her employment, Courthouse News reports. According to an Oregonian story from 2013, the drill led school officials to conclude that "not many" of the school's 15 teachers would have survived a real attack. (A Missouri family staged a kidnapping to terrify a 6-year-old boy who was "too nice" to strangers.)
Original Summary:  Teacher Linda McLean is suing a school district in Oregon after a traumatic "active shooter" drill at her school left her with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). During the drill, a safety officer pointed a pistol at McLean's face and told her she was "dead."

Original Story:  – H7N9 is growing no less mysterious: Roughly 40% of those infected in China's bird flu outbreak have never actually come in contact with poultry, according to a leading Chinese scientist, and the World Health Organization yesterday backed up that claim. WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl acknowledged "there are people who have no history of contact with poultry. ... This is one of the puzzles still (to) be solved," he tells Reuters. "It might be because of dust at the wet markets, it could be another animal source besides poultry, it could also be human-to-human transmission," though he added that there was still "no sustained evidence" of the latter. Officials are keeping a watchful eye on three Shanghai families and two boys in Beijing that they suspect may have infected each other, Hartl tells the New York Times, but he cautioned that even if members of the same family tested positive, it wouldn't be conclusive. The Times reports there's also growing concern that the virus may not have originated in birds, but in another animal. But China maintains that live poultry markets are the source; it's collected 47,801 samples from 1,000 such markets and farms to prove it. But only 39 tested positive, a number that Hartl notes is low.

Original Story:  – A lawsuit filed by young activists who say the government is failing to protect them from climate change is still alive, the AP reports. In San Francisco on Friday, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the government's second request for an order directing a lower court to dismiss the case. The lawsuit brought by 21 children and young adults asserts the government has long known that carbon pollution causes climate change but has failed to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

A trial is set to begin Oct. 29 in Eugene, Oregon. In related news, New York City's effort to hold oil companies responsible for global warming was rejected by a judge Thursday who said placing blame for the issue is not the judiciary's responsibility, per the AP. US District Judge John F. Keenan said global warming is a problem best left to the other two branches of government—Congress and the executive, notes CNBC. "The immense and complicated problem of global warming requires a comprehensive solution that weighs the global benefits of fossil fuel use with the gravity of the impending harms," Keenan writes in his decision. Meanwhile, Baltimore on Friday become the latest US city to try and hold the world's biggest oil companies financially responsible for global warming, per the AP. The city filed a lawsuit in Baltimore Circuit Court for unspecified damages against 26 oil and gas companies.
Original Summary:  A lawsuit filed by young activists against the US government for failing to protect them from climate change is still ongoing, with the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejecting the government's second request to dismiss the case. The lawsuit asserts that the government has known for years that carbon pollution causes climate change but has failed to take action. A trial is set to begin in October in Oregon. A judge in New York rejected a similar lawsuit against oil companies, saying it is not the judiciary's responsibility to place blame for global warming. Baltimore has become the latest US city to file a lawsuit against oil and gas companies for damages related to climate change.

In San Francisco on Friday, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the government's second request for an order directing a lower court to dismiss the case.

Original Story:  – The last time North Korea held a political gathering this big, Jimmy Carter was the No. 1 Yankee imperialist to denounce. Pyongyang has been spruced up and thousands of delegates from the ruling Workers' Party have gathered for the first party congress in 36 years, and North Korea says "miraculous results" in fields such as missile development will be unveiled, Reuters reports. Leader Kim Jong Un—who hadn't even been born when the last congress was held in 1980—will officially preside over the meeting, though it's not clear whether he will address it, reports the AP. The meeting will elect a new party central committee, and analysts expect Kim to promote younger officials loyal to him, including his sister, Kim Yo Jong. State media said the congress, the seventh in the party's history, will "unveil the brilliant blueprint to bring forward the final victory of our revolution." Pyongyang, unusually, invited more than 100 foreign journalists to cover the event—but they're not being allowed inside the flag-draped "April 25 House of Culture," where the congress is being held. Instead, they have gathered outside the venue, and the BBC's correspondent says the foreign reporters are being closely watched at all times. The Financial Times reports the congress was supposed to be held every five years; Voice of America takes a look at why there was such a gap. (North Korea banned weddings and funerals in the runup to the congress.)

Original Story:  – "Oh my God. That's bad. That's messed up." That was the reaction of one Delaware viewer interviewed by the News Journal to a video released yesterday showing a white Dover Police Department officer kicking a black suspect in the head during an August 2013 incident, the newspaper reports. Cpl. Thomas Webster can be seen about halfway through the five-minute, 25-second video (taken from a police car dashboard camera) coming up to a then-30-year-old Lateef Dickerson near a Dover gas station where a fight had been reported, with gun drawn. Ordered to the ground, Dickerson begins to comply; Webster kicks him once in the head. Dickerson lost consciousness and was taken to the hospital with a broken jaw, the paper adds. A 2014 grand jury chose not to indict Webster, and that same year the US Attorney's Office said Dickerson's civil rights hadn't been violated, per Reuters—actions that prompted the ACLU to sue the police department and demand the video's release. Attorney General Matt Denn, in place since just January, took a personal look at the case and requested a second grand jury to weigh in; it indicted Webster Monday and he was arrested on a felony assault charge that day. Rep. Sean Lynn tells the News Journal that the officer's use of force "seems completely unwarranted. … I was definitely taken aback." Meanwhile, the head of the Delaware police union had a different rationale for why criminal charges were brought: "It's not fair. This was done because of what is taking place in society today," he said in apparent reference to Baltimore and Ferguson. Webster's lawyer says his client will plead not guilty; he's out on $5,000 bail.

Original Story:  – Want to raise $1 million? Promise women—and their significant others—a device that allows them to have sex during their periods without worrying about blood. Mashable reports the Flex Company received that amount in funding this month. The San Francisco-based startup, which calls its FLEX menstrual disc the anti-tampon, has been accepting orders online since April, reports the Telegraph. TechCrunch reports Flex has received orders for 250 million of its menstrual discs since then—and 20% of its customers have been men. Flex plans to start shipping menstrual discs in September. An Aug. 4 Medium post from founder Lauren Schulte explains FLEX is exclusively sold online, in a one-off eight-pack or via a monthly or quarterly subscription. FLEX is a single-use menstrual cup that can be worn for up to 12 hours without the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome. It's also hypoallergenic and latex-free, and can help "alleviate cramps." Because the discs collect menstrual fluid while being worn next to the cervix instead of in the vaginal canal, Flex says they can be worn during intercourse for "mess-free period sex." "Women spend almost a quarter of their lives menstruating, and if we can help make women feel even slightly less ashamed about her body during this time, we’ve accomplished our mission," Flex explains. Schulte explains the impetus for the company was her own experience, which included persistent yeast infections. "It wasn’t until a nurse practitioner mentioned that my cotton tampons could be to blame that I even considered the menstrual products I was using to be both impractical and harmful." (This company told its female workers to take time off for their periods.)

Original Story:  – You heard it straight from the spacecraft's mouth: "Confirmed: I am in orbit around #Ceres." That was the tweet sent out from the Dawn Mission at 9:37am EST this morning to announce NASA's first spacecraft to arrive at a dwarf planet. The agency confirmed the Dawn entered Ceres' orbit in the asteroid belt nestled between Mars and Jupiter, the AP reports. A NASA press release says the spacecraft was about 38,000 miles away from Ceres when it was sucked in by the dwarf planet's gravity around 7:39am; the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a confirmation ping at 8:36am that Dawn was "healthy and thrusting with its ion engine"—a sure sign it achieved orbit. "We feel exhilarated," says Christopher Russell, the spacecraft's lead investigator, per the release. Ceres wasn't the Dawn's only stop on its 7.5-year, 3.1 billion-mile journey: From 2011 to 2012, the spacecraft poked around the Vesta asteroid, making it the first spacecraft to orbit two extraterrestrial objects, NASA notes. This feat wouldn't have been possible without the high-powered, Star Wars-like ion engines that pushed the Dawn over that massive distance with relatively little fuel, USA Today notes. The Ceres mission, which will last until at least mid-2016, will attempt to answer questions—about possible oceans, ice caps, or life—that have lurked since the dwarf planet was discovered in 1801. It's been "like your secret neighbor. Ceres would tell us nothing," Russell tells the paper. And Vesta and Ceres are just the start: The New Horizons spacecraft is set to pass Pluto over the summer, per the AP. (Maybe now we can figure out what those mysterious bright spots on Ceres are.)
Original Summary:  The Dawn spacecraft has entered orbit around Ceres, a dwarf planet in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. This is the first time a NASA spacecraft has reached a dwarf planet. The Dawn spacecraft was about 38,000 miles away from Ceres when it was pulled in by the dwarf planet's gravity. The spacecraft's ion engine was used to achieve orbit, which is a significant achievement as it allows the spacecraft to travel long distances with relatively little fuel.

Original Story:  – The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Trump administration on Thursday, refusing to reinstate the president's executive order restricting immigration and refugees from seven majority-Muslim nations, the Washington Post reports. The decision upholds the ruling of Judge James Robart made last Friday, which first blocked Trump's travel ban. The court bought into the arguments of Washington state and Minnesota that the ban—even a temporary reinstatement of it—would cause harm to the states, specifically their universities, according to the AP. Reuters reports it was a unanimous ruling of all three judges on the Court of Appeals. In its ruling, the court found the Trump administration failed to show the US would be harmed if the travel ban weren't reinstated. It also didn't completely buy the administration's arguments for why the ban is needed, and ruled that comments by Trump and his advisers could be used to determine the intent of the ban, CBS News reports. The court didn't rule on the constitutionality or legality of Trump's executive order, only that the suspension of it could be kept in place. Trump responded in a tweet following the ruling: "SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!" The executive order will likely now head to the Supreme Court, where a 4-4 split is probable. In the case of a tie, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling would hold.

Original Story:  – Is there a reason neurotic people tend to be bigger worriers but also more creative than the rest of us? A newly published theory says yes, and it has to do with daydreaming. Neurotics—famous ones include Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, and, of course, Woody Allen—get anxious and obsessed with everyday things, are risk-averse and brooding, and avoid dangerous jobs, explains Time. But psychologist Adam Perkins wanted to know what all that had to do with being more creative and better at problem-solving. His breakthrough came when he attended a lecture on the connection between daydreaming and creativity by Jonathan Smallwood. He "talked about the way daydreamers' minds wander when they're feeling kind of blue, and my ears perked up," says Perkins. According to the new study by Perkins and Smallwood, neuroticism may be caused by hyperactivity in the brain's medial prefrontal cortex, which handles threat-related thoughts. They came to this connection thanks to a previous Smallwood study in which he put volunteers into MRI machines with nothing to do, leaving them to daydream. The medial prefrontal cortex is more active in neurotics, who tended to dwell on problems and threats for much longer while daydreaming, according to the Hindu. It could be exactly this inclination to dwell on problems for much longer than other people that allows neurotics to come up with more creative solutions. In short, "the authors argue that the part of the brain responsible for self-generated thought is highly active in neuroticism, which yields both of the trait's positives (e.g., creativity) and negatives (e.g., misery)," according to a press release. Or as Forbes puts it, "the capacity to conjure up threats that don’t necessarily exist could also help you conjure up other types of ideas, ones that are insightful and valuable to problem-solving—i.e., creativity." (Of course, neuroticism has its downsides, too.)

Original Story:  – A former NASCAR driver and his grown daughter found themselves in a fight Friday night with three men outside a Rascal Flatts concert, police in Charlotte, NC, confirm to USA Today Sports. Mike Wallace, 57, had just left the PNC Music Pavilion with his family when a verbal spat went south. "Mike was talking to one of the three men and then, out of nowhere, one came after Mike like a crazy man," said Wallace's brother, Kenny Wallace. "Mike was knocked out completely cold. While he was on the ground they continued to beat on him, kicking him in the face." Wallace's daughter, Lindsey Wallace Van Wingerden, reportedly leaped onto her dad's unconscious body to protect him, which is when the three suspects started beating her instead, Kenny Wallace says. Per ESPN, the police report said no weapons were involved and injuries to Wallace and Van Wingerden were minor, though they certainly sound painful: Wallace says he suffered a concussion, a black eye, and three teeth forced a few inches back into his mouth. But even as he was reportedly being pummeled by the three men—whom he says he doesn't know and who the Washington Post says all topped 6 feet tall and weighed more than 200 pounds each—Wallace was mainly worried for his daughter, he tells Channel 9. "I woke up. I see my daughter laying on the ground, which is devastating for a father," he says. Arrested in the attack, per a Charlotte-Mecklenburg PD rep: 29-year-old Paul Lucas, 22-year-old Nathan Lucas, and 24-year-old Randolph Mangum, all of whom were hit with a simple assault charge and let out on $1,000 bond. Per a post on his Facebook page (tweeted out by SiriusXM motorsports host Dave Moody), Wallace said the men—allegedly lawn contractors for PNC— had been involved in multiple dustups at PNC before. But a witness tells the station the Wallaces started the brawl. "Kenny Wallace has used a public platform to blow this thing up and destroy a family," that unnamed witness says.
Original Summary:  A former NASCAR driver, Mike Wallace, and his daughter Lindsey were attacked by three men outside a Rascal Flatts concert in Charlotte, NC. The men, who were arrested and charged with simple assault, allegedly beat Wallace and his daughter after a verbal altercation. Wallace suffered a concussion, black eye, and lost teeth, while his daughter was also injured. The attack reportedly occurred after the men, who were lawn contractors for the PNC Music Pavilion, were involved in multiple altercations at the venue before. A witness claimed that the Wallaces started the brawl, but Wallace disputed this claim in a public statement.

Mike Wallace, 57, had just left the PNC Music Pavilion with his family when a verbal spat went south. "Mike was talking to one of the three men and then, out of nowhere, one came after Mike like a crazy man," said Wallace's brother, Kenny Wallace. "Mike was knocked out completely cold. While he was on the ground they continued to beat on him, kicking him in the face."

Original Story:  – A Paris magazine has caused a stir by reviving a sensational allegation about Adolf Hitler: He supposedly fathered a son with a French teen while he was a soldier in World War I. The Telegraph has the details: The son's name is Jean-Marie Loret, and he died in 1985 having never met his father. In fact, he fought against Nazi forces in World War II. His biological mother, Charlotte Lobjoie, was 16 when she said she struck up a relationship with the young Hitler, who was on leave. Loret has told his story publicly before; he even wrote a book called Your Father's Name Was Hitler, which is now being republished. According to the story, Hitler never acknowledged his son, though he kept in touch with Lobjoie over the years. The Paris magazine LePoint presents lots of circumstantial evidence: The men have the same blood type, the German army gave envelopes of money to Lobjoie in WWII, paintings seemingly signed by Hitler were found in her attic upon her death, etc. The magazine's report is here, and though it's in French, you can at least see photos of Hitler and Loret side-by-side. The Telegraph sees an "astonishing resemblance," which is debatable. (But the mustaches definitely look alike.)

Original Story:  – Lawmakers from both parties say they're deeply saddened by the news that Sen. John McCain has an aggressive form of brain cancer. McCain has glioblastoma, a type of tumor that Michael Berens at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix has studied for 30 years. He tells the Arizona Republic that the tumor spreads with "finger-like projections," with wandering cells creating "guerilla warfare in the brain." He says that patients who undergo surgery and chemotherapy survive for an average of 16 to 18 months after diagnosis. "When I heard of the diagnosis, my heart sank,” Berens says. McCain is "a man of great courage and endurance. He has a rough journey ahead of him." In other coverage: Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters he spoke to McCain, a close friend, Wednesday and that the senator briefly discussed his condition before saying, "I've been through worse" and shifting the conversation to politics, Politico reports. "God knows how this ends, not me," Graham said. "But I do know this: This disease has never had a more worthy opponent." Barack Obama was among the many other well-wishers. "John McCain is an American hero & one of the bravest fighters I've ever known," he tweeted. "Cancer doesn't know what it's up against. Give it hell, John." President Trump tweeted: "Melania and I send our thoughts and prayers to Senator McCain, Cindy, and their entire family. Get well soon." The Washington Post has more on glioblastoma, which killed both Sen. Ted Kennedy and Beau Biden, Joe Biden's son. Experts say that symptoms, including problems expressing yourself or understanding what you're listening to, are often only recognized in hindsight. Deepa Subramaniam, director of the brain tumor center at Georgetown University's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, tells the Post that survival times vary widely, with 30% of patients living more than two years after the diagnosis and 10% surviving five years. In rare cases, she says, some patients survive for as long as 15 or 20 years. The Hill reports that Republican senators who were gathered for a meeting on health care negotiations prayed for McCain on Wednesday night after hearing the news. They acknowledged that his absence will make it even tougher to pass health care legislation. McCain's office says he's in good spirits, is "grateful to the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic for their outstanding care, and is confident that any future treatment will be effective." The office says it will be up to doctors when McCain returns to the Senate. One of the most moving messages in support of the senator came from daughter Meghan McCain, reports the New York Times. "It won't surprise you to learn that in all this, the one of us who is most confident and calm is my father. He is the toughest person I know," she tweeted. "Cancer may afflict him in many ways: but it will not make him surrender. Nothing ever has."
Original Summary:  Senator John McCain has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, glioblastoma. The tumor has "finger-like projections" that spread throughout the brain, according to a doctor who has studied the disease for 30 years. Despite the grim prognosis, McCain is reportedly in good spirits and determined to continue his work in the Senate. Many politicians and public figures have offered their support and well wishes to McCain and his family. The disease has claimed the lives of several prominent individuals, including Senator Ted Kennedy and Beau Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden.

Original Story:  – An English "super-henge" just became more super. Durrington Walls, one of the largest known henges and located less than 2 miles from Stonehenge, was believed to have been built in the Neolithic period around 4,500 years ago, and the way it aligns to the solstices like Stonehenge led scientists to believe they may have been built around the same time, per the Telegraph. But a new find underneath Durrington's grassy banks—specifically, the discovery of 90 enormous "standing stones" (30 intact and the remnants of 60 others) that may have formed the southern edge of an arena used for rituals—has scientists reworking everything they thought they knew, the Guardian notes. "What we are starting to see is the largest surviving stone monument, preserved underneath a bank, that has ever been discovered in Britain and possibly in Europe," Vince Gaffney, one of the lead archaeologists for the Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project tells the paper. "This is archaeology on steroids." Ground-piercing radar helped the scientists discover the stones, which they believe used to be erect but were pushed over when the bank was built on top of them, the Guardian notes. The hidden stones were apparently part of a C-shaped arena that faced the Avon River. "We can't tell what the stones are made of, but they are the same height as the sarsens in the Stonehenge circle, so they may be the same kind," Gaffney tells the Telegraph. "These monuments were very theatrical. This a design to impress and empower." The discovery is only the most recent find by scientists working on the Stonehenge project: Last year the remnants of 17 chapels were found, the Guardian notes. But this find is one of the hugest. "Everything written previously about the Stonehenge landscape and the ancient monuments within it will need to be rewritten," one of the project's lead historians tells the Guardian. (Scientists say Marden Henge was even more impressive than Stonehenge.)
Original Summary:  Durrington Walls, a Neolithic henge near Stonehenge, has revealed new findings of 90 massive standing stones, which may have formed an arena for rituals. The discovery was made using ground-piercing radar and has led scientists to reevaluate their understanding of the site and its connection to Stonehenge. The discovered stones are believed to be the same height as the sarsens in the Stonehenge circle and may be the same type of stone. The find is significant as it challenges previous assumptions about the size and complexity of ancient monuments in the area. The discovery of the standing stones is one of the largest finds in recent years and will likely change the way scientists understand the Stonehenge landscape.

Original Story:  – If you're a T-Mobile customer, the following is unlikely to deepen your love for your mobile carrier. The FTC today filed a complaint alleging that T-Mobile has for years "crammed bogus charges onto customers' bills," making hundreds of millions in the process, per a press release on the matter. The FTC claims that T-Mobile took a 35% to 40% cut of the typically $9.99 per month cost of subscriptions that were, in many cases, not authorized by its customers. What kinds of subscriptions? "Flirting tips, horoscope information, or celebrity gossip." The practice is known as "cramming," explains the AP: businesses stuff a customer's bill with bogus charges associated with a third party. And the FTC alleges there were "clear warning signs the charges it was imposing were fraudulent": In some months, T-Mobile saw as many as 40% of customers demanding refunds, a rate the FTC feels should have raised red flags. Further, internal company documents show the elevated level of complaints stretched back to at least early 2012. The FTC wants a court order barring T-Mobile from engaging in cramming, refunds, and "disgorgement of T-Mobile's ill-gotten gains." Writing for Consumerist, Chris Morran isn't impressed with T-Mobile CEO John Legere's response, which reads in part: "T-Mobile stopped billing for these Premium SMS services last year and launched a proactive program to provide full refunds for any customer that feels that they were charged for something they did not want." Writes Morran, "So there you go, America. T-Mobile shouldn't be sued for something it made a mountain of money from because it is no longer making that mountain of money and it’s offering refunds to customers who 'feel' they were charged for something they didn't order."
Original Summary:  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a complaint against T-Mobile, alleging that the company has been charging customers for unauthorized subscriptions worth $9.99 per month since 2012. The charges were for services such as flirting tips, horoscope information, and celebrity gossip, despite customers not authorizing them. T-Mobile took a 35-40% cut of the charges, earning the company hundreds of millions of dollars. The FTC claims that there were red flags indicating the charges were fraudulent, including high volumes of customer complaints and refund requests. The FTC seeks a court order to bar T-Mobile from engaging in cramming and to refund ill-gotten gains.

Original Story:  – Critics are so divided on Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland that it's hard to believe they all went down the same rabbit hole. Most have high praise for the 3-D visuals but some complain there's more Disney than Burton. Purists may not care for Burton's updating of Lewis Caroll's classics, but his vision, with "a more empowered 19-year-old Alice, is engaging and amusing," writes Claudia Puig at USA Today. "The visual landscape in which she travels is awash in color, magic and splendor." The movie's pretty but unmemorable, complains Katey Rich at CinemaBlend. "We're meant to be dazzled by the visuals and the whimsy," she writes, "when even the youngest child knows the best parts of Lewis Carroll involve the threat of danger and mayhem just below the surface." Burton's "literally eye-popping world of beasties, Scots accents and gloom" is one of the most inventive uses of 3-D ever seen, writes Roger Moore in the Orlando Sentinel. The cast, including Jonny Depp as a "madder-than-usual hatter," is near-perfect, he writes. Alice is "predictably rich in images," writes Joe Williams at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, but it has "little of the heart or madcap energy we might have expected. Somehow, a children's fable about playful language and imagination has become yet another overblown fantasy about a teenager who's been prophesied to lead an army into battle."

Original Story:  – If you've ever wanted to get a good look at an asteroid, Monday night will be your best chance for more than a decade. Asteroid 2004 BL86, a space rock about a third of a mile in diameter, will be 745,000 miles away on Monday, around three times as far away as the moon, reports CNN. Barring cosmic surprises, the next close encounter with something that big will be in 2027, and NASA says that while 2004 BL86 doesn't pose any threat, it gives astronomers a "unique opportunity to observe and learn more." Very little is known about this particular asteroid and it won't be this close again for 200 years. Amateur astronomers might be able to see the space rock with strong telescopes or binocuIars. "I may grab my favorite binoculars and give it a shot myself," the chief of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office says in a press release. "Asteroids are something special. Not only did asteroids provide Earth with the building blocks of life and much of its water, but in the future, they will become valuable resources for mineral ores and other vital natural resources. They will also become the fueling stops for humanity as we continue to explore our solar system. There is something about asteroids that makes me want to look up." Tech Times has some tips for those who want to try to spot 2004 BL86, which will be at its brightest between 11:07pm and 11:52pm EST.

But thanks to her massive empire—Harpo Productions, her magazine and radio station, and a number of popular shows she's involved in—she managed to top Forbes' list of the highest-paid celebs for the fourth consecutive year. The magazine estimates she made $165 million between May 2011 and May 2012. But she may not go five-for-five, as Forbes won't add syndication bucks to her tally next year. The rest of the top five: Michael Bay, $160 million: The Transformers director has the third film in the franchise to thank—it was panned by critics, but made a bundle at the box office, and he gets a large chunk of the money from related toys, too. Steven Spielberg, $130 million: Not a surprising entrant, Spielberg made his money from residuals, DreamWorks productions, directing, and Universal Studios amusement park ticket sales. Jerry Bruckheimer, $115 million: His Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides made more money than any other film in the franchise. Dr. Dre, $110 million: Forbes calls him "the most surprising celebrity" on the list. He made more money than usual this time around thanks to his Beats by Dr. Dre headphones.

Original Story:  – Harvey has made landfall again, this time as a tropical storm near the Louisiana-Texas border on the day after the 12th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. ABC News reports the storm came ashore just west of Cameron, La., around 5am ET, with CNN noting that winds of roughly 40mph and a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet are expected. NOAA's public advisory now predicts another 3 to 6 inches of rain in southwestern Louisiana, the eastern Texas border area, and western Kentucky through Friday, with some areas getting as many as 10 inches. But as one National Hurricane Center meteorologist puts it, it's not the end, but the "end of the beginning": Per NOAA, "While the threat of heavy rains has ended in the Houston/Galveston area, catastrophic and life-threatening flooding will continue in and around Houston eastward into southwest Louisiana for the rest of the week." More: The AP describes things as "dire" in Port Arthur, Texas, near the Louisiana border, on Wednesday morning, as rising floodwaters inundated homes. Port Arthur Mayor Derrick Freeman said on his Facebook page that the "city is underwater right now but we are coming!" The AP also suggests some potential relief, at least from the rain, for Houston, with expected rainfall for Wednesday at less than an inch. People reports on one of Harvey's victims: a 41-year-old mother from Beaumont, Texas, who police say "absolutely" saved the life of her 3-year-old daughter; the child was found floating in a canal with her mother after the two became stuck while driving. "The baby also had a backpack that was helping her float on her back and she was holding on to her mom," says an officer. Add this to Harvey's toll: two ExxonMobil refineries, which sustained storm-related damage that facilitated the release of pollutants. The Washington Post has the details on the damage at the Baytown oil refinery, America's second-biggest, and the Beaumont petrochemical refinery. NPR explains that the cleanup bill for Harvey could be as much as $100 billion, and while Congress will likely approve the funding needed, "it probably won't be easy." It explains why, and the waves in which the funding would be issued. The New York Times reports that a 12am to 5am curfew is now in place in Houston, and came partly in response to reports of "small-scale looting." The Times puts the death toll at no less than 30. A longtime Houston cop is among the dead.

I'd rather be in the hospital, comfortable, with my pain under control, than be at home in pain and uncomfortable. I feel safer here right now, and I think my anxiety is telling me I should stay right now." Adds Jardin: "This cancer patient, who is much older but no wiser, can empathize."

Original Story:  – A Philadelphia murderer is out of solitary confinement for the first time in 37 years, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. Arthur Johnson, 64, was sentenced to life in prison for a 1970 gang killing. He was placed in solitary confinement in 1979 after multiple escape attempts. In September, Johnson sued the state of Pennsylvania, claiming cruel and unusual punishment in violation of his constitutional rights. His lawyer argued that Johnson hadn't had a disciplinary problem in a quarter of a century and that the mere possibility of an escape attempt isn't justification enough for indefinite solitary confinement. A federal judge agreed, saying Johnson was subjected to "institutional exile" in an "area smaller than the average horse stall." Johnson returned to the general population at SCI Greene state prison last Friday. The Christian Science Monitor reports solitary confinement can increase the risk of suicide and the likelihood of recidivism. Johnson says nearly four decades in a 7-foot-by-12-foot cell left him with depression, anxiety, loss of short-term memory, insomnia, and more.
Original Summary:  Arthur Johnson, a 64-year-old man who has been in prison for 43 years, was released from solitary confinement after being held in isolation for 37 years. Johnson was sentenced to life in prison for a gang killing in 1970 and was placed in solitary confinement in 1979 due to multiple escape attempts. A federal judge recently ruled that Johnson's indefinite solitary confinement was unconstitutional, citing the potential for suicide and recidivism. Johnson has experienced depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues as a result of his prolonged time in isolation. He was returned to the general population at SCI Greene state prison last Friday.

Original Story:  – With treasure worth up to $17 billion still at the bottom of the sea, experts aren't ready to disclose the exact location of a Spanish galleon sunk during a battle in 1708—but they did have other details on the "holy grail of shipwrecks" to reveal this week. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution has disclosed for the first time that its REMUS 6000 autonomous underwater vehicle found the wreck of the San Jose in more than 2,000 feet of water in late 2015, the AP reports. "We've been holding this under wraps out of respect for the Colombian government," says WHOI official Rob Munier. The institution says it was initially unclear whether the wreck detected at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea was the San Jose or another vessel, Live Science reports. The REMUS 6000 descended to within 30 feet of the largely sediment-covered wreck, allowing researchers to spot identifying details including the distinctive dolphins carved on the galleon's cannons. The 62-gun galleon, laden with gold, silver, and emeralds, was sunk with 600 people on board by British ships during the War of Spanish Succession. Colombia says it plans to display the cannons and other items from the wreck in a museum. The treasure has yet to be recovered, and United Nations cultural agency UNESCO has urged Colombia not to commercially exploit the wreck. (The search for MH370 may have solved some maritime mysteries.)

Original Story:  – Though talks are underway with Boko Haram militants to secure the release of more than 200 kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls, one may have escaped on her own. A woman, identified as one of those kidnapped by the al-Qaeda-linked group in April, was found "heavily traumatized and not very stable" Wednesday, wandering through a small village in northeastern Nigeria, NBC News and the Guardian report. She was found about 60 miles from where the girls were taken and 75 miles from the nearest Boko Haram cell, Reuters reports. Residents say the 20-year-old, the first of the missing schoolgirls to be recovered in months, may have escaped her captors. Local officials say it's also possible she was released. "She had been running around the bush for about four days before she reached here," a local farmer says. Officials say she is receiving medical treatment and is in "stable" condition, though a man who visited the woman says she hasn't been able to explain how she became free. A father whose two daughters remain Boko Haram captives says the woman has now been moved to the city of Yola. "We are all happy that one of our girls has escaped," another father says. "But it is difficult seeing the state the girl was in, and to think about what is happening to the others." Boko Haram has released the names of 19 militants it wants released in return for the girls, the Telegraph reports.

Original Story:  – Authorities have found a week-old baby who was reported missing Thursday after her mother was shot to death in Kansas, police said Saturday. Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay said baby Sophia Abarca-Nogueda was found alive after authorities executed a search warrant before dawn at a Dallas home, the Wichita Eagle reports. He said the baby is in protective custody and is doing well. "This is the best possible outcome to a very sad case," Ramsay said at a news conference. Two adults were in custody and being interviewed Saturday, Ramsay said. He also said more suspects could be identified, but provided few details, saying "it is still an active investigation." No one has been charged, reports the AP. "It's a complicated case and we want to make sure we get it right," Ramsay said. Police said investigators established late Friday that someone who knew the mother had fled to Dallas with the baby. The baby was reported missing, the same day her mother, 27-year-old Laura Abarca-Nogueda, was shot to death in her west Wichita apartment. The FBI had joined the search for the baby, and investigators worked around the clock since Sophia went missing, he said. "Hard work and the collaboration with the FBI is really what made this (closure) come about," he said. Sophia will be reunited with relatives "as soon as possible," he said. Dallas police "dropped everything" to assist in the case once investigators learned Sophia was there, Ramsay said.

Original Story:  – It started as just another day at the office for Brian "Poshybrid" Vigneault, a 35-year-old gamer known to spend multiple days in a given week live-streaming himself playing the game World of Tanks for 20-plus hours straight. This time, however, the Virginia Beach father of three got up to smoke a cigarette 22 hours into his stream about 4:30am EST on Feb. 19 and never returned. People figured he fell asleep, but when a friend sent a message the next day, the response came from a police detective investigating his death, reports Kotaku. The exhausted-looking father of three had been streaming on the gaming platform Twitch to raise money for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and PCGames reports he'd been doing similar marathon gaming streams over the past few weeks. While the cause of Vigneault's death hasn't been determined, PVP Live reports that much of the speculation centers on sleep deprivation and related heart complications. The site notes that big-name streamers have been complaining about the pressure they feel to go for longer and longer stretches, and Vigneault was known for chain-smoking and drinking during his own sessions. Vigneault's death is being mourned online, with the moderators of his Twitch stream turning his channel into a memorial. (This man died during a three-day gaming binge.)

He had been streaming for 22 hours when he got up to smoke a cigarette and never returned. A police detective investigating his death informed his friend the next day that Vigneault had passed away. The cause of death is still unknown, but speculation centers on sleep deprivation and related heart complications. Vigneault was known for his marathon gaming sessions and had been complaining about the pressure to go longer and longer stretches.

This time, however, the Virginia Beach father of three got up to smoke a cigarette 22 hours into his stream about 4:30am EST on Feb. 19 and never returned. People figured he fell asleep, but when a friend sent a message the next day, the response came from a police detective investigating his death, reports Kotaku. The exhausted-looking father of three had been streaming on the gaming platform Twitch to raise money for the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and PCGames reports he'd been doing similar marathon gaming streams over the past few weeks. While the cause of Vigneault's death hasn't been determined, PVP Live reports that much of the speculation centers on sleep deprivation and related heart complications. The site notes that big-name streamers have been complaining about the pressure they feel to go for longer and longer stretches, and Vigneault was known for chain-smoking and drinking during his own sessions.

Original Story:  – The San Francisco Police Department might be close to finally catching the Doodler, a 1970s serial killer more savage than his nickname might suggest. The killer is believed to have killed at least five gay men and possibly up to 14 in 1974 and 1975, SF Weekly reports. Police say the killer would approach men in bars, sketch them, and leave with them. The victims were stabbed multiple times; one was nearly decapitated. The bodies were left in the open in locations including beaches and golf courses. Inspector Dan Cunningham, who recently took charge of San Francisco's cold case unit, tells CNN they have a suspect and are now "connecting the dots." Cunningham says he is trying to track down a European diplomat believed to be one of three people who were assaulted by the Doodler and survived. The victims provided information that helped police create a sketch. But fearing their sexuality would be exposed, they refused to testify when a man matching the suspect's description was arrested outside a bar with a butcher knife and a book of sketches, meaning the man, who is apparently still the main Doodler suspect, was never charged. Cunningham says he plans to work with the crime lab to see if a usable DNA sample can be taken from 43-year-old crime scene evidence. If the suspect is still alive, he would now be in his early 60s. Cunningham says he plans to release an updated sketch of the suspect when he has "all his ducks in a row."

Original Story:  – For detractors who complain that their iPhones just don't do enough, Apple may be upping the ante. Rumors are swirling that when the iPhone 6 is unveiled on Sept. 9, it's not only going to play music, surf the Internet, and make phone calls—it will also function as a mobile wallet, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity to Bloomberg. Apple is reportedly teaming up with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express—none of whom are commenting about the speculation—for the newest iPhone incarnation, which would allow shoppers to make purchases at participating retail locations. It makes sense for Apple to get into the mobile payment game, notes Wired: It's already got hundreds of millions of credit cards on file thank to iTunes, as well as an eager, brand-loyal user base. Plus, Apple has applied for various e-wallet patents over the years, reports Time. The iPhone 6 would likely feature near-field communication technology, which, according to NearFieldCommunication.org, is a form of "contactless communication" that lets a user simply wave his or her phone over a compatible device to make a transaction or complete a task. Although other tech powerhouses have tried to incorporate their own mobile payment services (Google Wallet, anyone?), consumers still aren't clamoring for that technology, reports the New York Times.

Original Story:  – For the past 30 years, scientists have been exploring a cemetery in Egypt whose origins are mysterious. One thing they have determined, however: "We are fairly certain we have over a million burials within this cemetery. It's large, and it's dense," says the project's director, Kerry Muhlestein of Brigham Young University. Dubbed Fag el-Gamous, the grounds are full of bodies that date to between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, Live Science reports. The remains don't belong to royalty, and most weren't actively mummified by people—but the dry surroundings led to what could "loosely" be called mummies, says Muhlestein, who has blogged about the findings. Brigham Young researchers have dug up more than 1,700 burials over the past three decades, they write in Studia Antiqua, noting that they're not the first researchers to investigate the site. Among recent findings are the remains of an 18-month-old from about 1,500 years ago. "There was some evidence that they tried much of the full mummification process. The toes and toenails and brain and tongue were amazingly preserved," researchers say. As for where the child, or countless others, came from, researchers aren't sure. Interestingly, a database reveals that blond people appear to have been buried together, with red-headed ones elsewhere; this could be due to families being buried together, researchers note. They also found one body that was more than seven feet tall—particularly surprising given poor nutrition at the time. (Perhaps they should alert this giant hunter.)

Original Story:  – Anthony Weiner is no longer merely a disgraced politician. Soon, he'll be an inmate. A judge on Monday sentenced the former congressman to 21 months in prison for sending explicit texts to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, reports the AP. Weiner's attorneys had argued for probation, saying the 53-year-old's repeated online dalliances showed he needed help, not punishment. He had faced up to 27 months. In court Monday, Weiner wept upon hearing the sentence, reports the AP. Earlier, he had tearfully told the judge that he was "a very sick man for a very long time" and referred to his crime as "rock bottom." In regard to jail, however, Judge Denise Cote sided with prosecutors, who argued that "transmitting obscenity to a minor to induce her to engage in sexually explicit conduct by video chat and photo—is far from mere 'sexting,'" per the Daily Beast. Before sentencing, Weiner's legal team had sought to depict the messages to the minor as an anomaly. Weiner exchanged "thousands of messages with hundreds of women (but this) was his first teenager and his last teenage victim," said a defense attorney, per a tweet from a Newsday reporter. As part of his guilty plea, Weiner will not appeal the sentence. He must report for prison on Nov. 6, reports the New York Times, which adds that Weiner remained seated between his attorneys after the judge left the courtroom, "crying, his face in his hands." Huma Abedin filed for divorce last year when news of the teen sexting scandal emerged. And all of this played a role in James Comey's decision to reopen an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email late in the election.
Original Summary:  Anthony Weiner was sentenced to 21 months in prison for sending explicit texts to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. His attorneys had argued for probation, but the judge sided with prosecutors who argued that Weiner's actions were not a one-time mistake but part of a pattern of behavior. Weiner tearfully apologized in court and acknowledged that he was "a very sick man for a very long time." The judge rejected Weiner's attempt to depict the messages to the minor as an anomaly and found that his actions were not just sexting but involved inducing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct.

Original Story:  – All that's left of the dodo bird is a smattering of bones—a nearly complete set of which has just sold for $431,000 at auction. This "extremely rare" version is one of the most complete with about 95% of bones present, reports the BBC. Only a portion of the skull and a set of claws are lacking, reports CNN. The skeleton—believed to be the first sold since 1914—was actually pieced together over four decades by a collector, which isn't atypical. "There are only twelve close to complete dodo skeletons in the world," all in the possession of museums, and all but one are composites, says Erroll Fuller of Summers Place Auctions in the UK. Found on Mauritius in the 16th century, the dodo disappeared by the late 1600s at the hands of humans and newly introduced dogs and monkey, Fuller says. Most of the bones that make up existing dodos were taken from Mauritius in the 19th century, but the island has since banned their export. That's one reason people were so interested in the skeleton. But the dodo also "represents extinction and how fast man can influence the environment," says Fuller. "Whether we're actually learning the lesson, I don't think I'd like to say," he adds, per CBS News. The BBC spoke to the unnamed collector who pieced together the bird, whose initial purchase was a foot bone in the 1970s. He didn't imagine it would lead to full skeleton. "I finally found myself looking at a dodo in my workshop, something so extraordinary that I hadn't really imagined it would happen," he says. (Dodos were pretty smart.)

Original Story:  – Dallas Seavey has won his second Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in a climactic finish that saw him speed past two competitors in the final 77 miles. During that span, Seavey, 26, passed Aliy Zirkle, who came in second, as well as four-time winner Jeff King. Zirkle has now come in second three years in a row, the AP reports; she finished a few minutes behind Seavey. It was one of the race's tightest finishes ever, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The race had "three leaders in three hours" last night," said executive director Stan Hooley. "It's very unusual." King, however, scratched at 11:50pm amid heavy winds. Seavey passed Zirkle after she paused for several hours at the Safety checkpoint during a storm; Seavey stayed at the checkpoint for just three minutes. It's the first time in two decades a competitor has lost the lead in the final 77 miles, the Daily News notes. Seavey was the race's youngest winner in 2012; his father, Mitch, was the oldest as a 53-year-old last year, the AP notes.

Original Story:  – The US will face a lot of hot air this week—and not all of it is coming from the Republican National Convention. Rather, a "heat dome" is about to settle over the country, bringing temperatures as high as 115 degrees in some areas, NBC News reports. According to the AP, the high-pressure system is forecasted to keep hot air trapped over the US, beginning Wednesday in the Midwest. From there it will spread toward both coasts, generating high temperatures and heavy humidity. The National Weather Service has already issued heat alerts for more than a dozen states. But, while 200 million people will face temperatures of at least 90 degrees, it could be worse. "We're not talking record-breaking heat by any stretch," one meteorologist tells the AP. "The only thing is it is the warmest it's been this summer, so in that respect people may not be prepared for it."

Original Story:  – Marijuana legalization has been taken to the next level in Uruguay, where lawmakers have voted to make the government the first in the world to oversee the growing, distribution, and sale of the drug. The pioneering law, which takes effect in April, will allow registered users over 18 to buy a maximum of 40 grams of weed a month for $1 a gram from licensed pharmacies, Reuters reports. Smokers also have the option of growing up to six marijuana plants in their home—or joining clubs that can grow up to 99 plants a year. The push for legalization was spearheaded by President José Mujica, who says he is against drug consumption but wants to take the business away from violent drug cartels. To prevent drug tourism, only residents will be allowed to buy weed legally and the government has promised to take steps to stop people from exporting legally-bought marijuana to neighboring countries, the BBC reports. "This won't be a weed-for-all country," Mujica says.
Original Summary:  Uruguay has become the first country in the world to legalize the growing, distribution, and sale of marijuana. Under the new law, registered users can buy up to 40 grams of marijuana per month from licensed pharmacies for $1 per gram. Home cultivation is also allowed, with individuals or clubs able to grow up to 99 plants per year. The law was passed to take the drug trade away from violent cartels and to prevent drug tourism. President José Mujica has stated that the goal is not to encourage drug use, but to take control of the industry and reduce crime.

Under the new law, registered users can buy up to 40 grams of marijuana per month from licensed pharmacies for $1 per gram. Home cultivation is also allowed, with individuals or clubs able to grow up to 99 plants per year. The law was passed to take the drug trade away from violent cartels and to prevent drug tourism. President José Mujica has stated that the goal is not to encourage drug use, but to take control of the industry and reduce crime.

Original Story:  – One of the countless millions of family bonds severed by the chaos and horror of World War II has been made whole again after 71 years. Margot Bachmann's Italian mother was living in a forced-labor camp in Germany in 1944 when she was impregnated by a German soldier she had fallen in love with, the Washington Post reports. Nazi authorities took the baby away from her (perhaps as soon as a month after the child's birth) and placed the girl in a children's home. When the war ended, the woman, identified only as Gianna, returned to Italy, believing the child had been killed. She wasn't. The two were reunited last weekend by the International Tracing Service organization, which says in what is "close to a miracle" it was able to locate the 91-year-old mother in her home village in northern Italy. Bachmann was raised by the soldier and his family, who told her that her birth mother was Italian but ordered her not to try to find out more and gave the impression that she was dead, the Telegraph reports. Bachmann's own daughters encouraged her to search after her father's death and they were able to track down her birth certificate. "All my life I asked my family about you, without being given any answers. I want to come and find you so that I can hug you once again," she wrote to her, per the Telegraph. A Red Cross spokeswoman tells the Post that when they finally met, "a bottle of sparkling wine, the excitement of the reunification, and an exchange of gifts and family pictures filled the time." (A Facebook photo reunited this mother and son after 15 years.)
Original Summary:  After 71 years, a mother and daughter were reunited in Italy after being separated during World War II. The mother, Gianna, was living in a forced-labor camp in Germany in 1944 and was impregnated by a German soldier. The baby was taken away from her soon after birth and placed in a children's home. When the war ended, Gianna returned to Italy believing her child had been killed. The International Tracing Service organization was able to locate Gianna and the two were reunited last weekend.

Original Story:  – Newsweek is in the news again—and not for good reasons. The 85-year-old news magazine is engulfed in so much chaos and scandal that some staffers are wondering whether it will survive, according to USA Today. On Monday editor-in-chief Bob Roe, executive editor Ken Li, and reporter Celeste Katz were fired and other employees were sent home early, CNN reports. Political editor Matthew Cooper promptly resigned, praising Roe and Li for their efforts to pursue Newsweek's internal scandals. "I'm resigning from Newsweek at the end of business today, although perhaps that's moot since the staff has been sent home and the magazine, for all we know, doesn't exist," he said in a resignation letter posted on Twitter. Katz had reported on recent problems at Newsweek, whose offices were raided by the Manhattan District Attorney's office last month as part of what she said was a long-running investigation into the company's finances. Newsweek Media co-owner and chairman Etienne Uzac stepped down after the raid, as did his wife, finance director Marian Kim, NBC reports. Katz had also reported on chief content officer Dayan Candappa, who was placed on leave last month after accusations of sexual harassment. "My warmest thanks to the brave Newsweek editors and colleagues who supported and shared in my work—especially our recent, difficult stories about the magazine itself—before my dismissal today," she tweeted Monday. (Newsweek brought back a print edition in 2014 after going online-only in 2012.)

Original Story:  – Baby Hope got a step closer to justice yesterday, with the NYPD charging a relative of her father in her 1991 murder. Conrado Juarez, 52, confessed to sexually assaulting the little girl—who was recently identified as Anjelica Castillo—while he was drunk one night, and then smothering her, reports DNAinfo. A sister who has since died reportedly helped him hide Anjelica's body in a cooler, which they left on the side of the Henry Hudson Parkway; it was found by construction workers on July 23 of that year. Juarez, who is thought to be a cousin of Anjelica's father, was arrested at the New York City restaurant where he works Friday; he was charged yesterday. "Cold cases are not forgotten cases. Today's arrest of the man charged with killing Anjelica in 1991 is an extraordinary example of police work," said DA Cy Vance in announcing the arrest. A detective who had worked the case until his retirement this summer tells the AP, "You know the expression I'm on cloud 9? Well, that's where I am right now."

Original Story:  – Breeding over hundreds of generations has helped roses look better and live longer, but at the expense of their sweet-smelling scent, reports the AP. After all, those buying bouquets don't really care about a flower's ability to attract pollinators. A new study in the journal Science, however, may help restore the distinct aroma to roses that have become less potent over time. Experts were already aware of some 400 chemical compounds, the majority of which are alcohols, responsible for the scent of roses, Popular Science reports. This finding surrounds alcohols known as monoterpenes and what French researchers say was a previously unknown gene. Roses that "strongly expressed the gene produced more monoterpenes and had stronger scents," Discover explains. The gene, called RhNUDX1, was revealed as researchers compared the genomes of fragrant Papa Meilland roses—70% of their scent comes from monoterpenes—and scentless Rouge Meilland roses. In Papa Meilland roses, the RhNUDX1 enzyme produced a monoterpene called geraniol, which is actually the main component of rose oil. The gene was also found in Rouge Meilland roses, but it appeared to have been "turned off." An analysis of 10 other rose varieties proved roses with the active gene produced more monoterpenes and smelled sweeter. With a little meddling, scientists say the gene could be reactivated in less-potent flowers. As they found no genetic link between scent and a rose's ability to stay fresh after it’s been cut, they add breeders may soon get their rose and smell it, too. (Another study found a simple sniff test could diagnose autism.)

Original Story:  – Great news for anyone who's ever wanted to know what it's like to be a dolphin. Researchers have figured out how to see what dolphins "see" when they use echolocation, printing 2D and 3D images of a number of objects—including a human, NBC News reports. "Seeing the 3D print of a human being left us all speechless," Jack Kassewitz, lead researcher and founder of SpeakDolphin.com, says in a press release. "For the first time ever, we may be holding in our hands a glimpse into what cetaceans see with sound." Researchers were spurred to create the images after realizing dolphins listening to recordings of echolocation could figure out what object was being pinged with 92% accuracy. Researchers used a piece of equipment called a CymaScope—which "imprints sonic vibrations on the surface of ultra pure water"—to create images out of echolocation recordings, according to the press release. “When a dolphin scans an object with its high frequency sound beam, each short click captures a still image, similar to a camera taking photographs," says John Reid, inventor of the CymaScope. While the images created are mostly silhouettes, researchers believe it's possible dolphins' brains can create more detailed images out of echolocation than current human technology can reveal, Discovery reports. They also hypothesize dolphins can share echolocation images with each other through some sort of "sono-pictorial language." (Porpoises use sound like a flashlight.)

Original Story:  – For such an age-old problem, it's gotten surprisingly little scientific study. But now physicists at Berkeley think they've figured out why the knots of our shoelaces come untied, reports the BBC. Through slow-motion video, they found that it's a complex combination of stomping (your foot hitting the ground) and swinging (your leg gearing up for the next step). The forces exerted on the laces are surprisingly high, "more than twice the g-force astronauts feel during a typical rocket launch," in the words of the Christian Science Monitor. And the unraveling happens in two stages: a slow, gradual weakening followed by sudden failure. The scientists say the work has grand implications, but ordinary folks may be more interested in a takeaway noted at Science: The research confirms that square knots are better than the familiar "granny" knots many people use. "I've been tying it a new way for about two years now," grad student Christine Gregg, whose running was captured in the video, tells NBC News of her switch to square knots. (A slew of websites explain how to tie one, and Science also directs people to this TED Talk.) The study is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A, and researchers say it's "far from exhaustive" in that it doesn't take into account factors such as shoelace material. But as for those grand implications: "When you talk about knotted structures, if you can start to understand the shoelace, then you can apply it to other things, like DNA or microstructures," says co-author Christopher Daily-Diamond. The study is the "first step toward understanding why certain knots are better than others, which no one has really done." (Another study found that running might actually make knees healthier.)

Original Story:  – A new report reveals what appears to be a notable jump in the number US kids with an autism spectrum disorder, Live Science reports. According to a previous CDC estimate from medical records in 2010, one in 68 children had autism. But a new study states it's closer to one in 45 following interviews with nearly 12,000 parents in 2014. (It's an even bigger jump from a one-in-80 estimate that was based on interviews from 2011 to 2013, though researchers blame that dramatic increase on a change in interview methodology.) Experts believe these new numbers are the most accurate estimate. "We do believe autism is more prevalent, but we have long believed that the one in 68 number is an underestimate," the director of public health research at Autism Speaks says, per CNN. This new estimate is important for two reasons. One, the old estimate of one in 68 already had public health officials worried and resources maxed out, the Washington Post reports. It now falls to the country to figure out how to help an increasing number of kids with autism. Second, it fuels the debate about what's causing the steady increase over the past decade. According to Live Science, some researchers believe the jump is due to the increasing awareness and lessening stigma of autism. The Post reports others are looking to environmental factors as possible causes. Ultimately it may not matter. "The fact that we have one in 45 children with a very serious neurological condition is a catastrophe by any measure,” the president of the Autism Society of San Francisco says.
Original Summary:  A new report suggests that the number of children in the US with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has increased significantly, with an estimated one in 45 children affected. This is a jump from a previous estimate of one in 68 children based on medical records in 2010. The new estimate is based on interviews with nearly 12,000 parents in 2014. Experts believe that the new numbers are the most accurate estimate to date. The increase in the number of children with ASD is a concern for public health officials, who are now tasked with figuring out how to help an increasing number of kids with autism.
