Original Story:  – Kristen Stewart has always been inexplicably popular with a certain set, but this is above and beyond: A Middle Eastern prince paid $500,000 to talk with her for 15 minutes. Vulture spots the bizarre story in a longer New York Times article about Harvey Weinstein and the Sunday premiere of the Weinstein Company's film about the Hurricane Sandy relief concert. It seems the prince offered to make a generous contribution to the relief fund if Stewart would chat with him, and Weinstein eventually convinced her to do so. "How much?" Stewart asked, in Weinstein's telling of the story. Weinstein went back to the prince, got a number, and then talked him up to half a mil—which the prince gave him upfront, in cash. "And Kristen sits with the guy for 15 minutes," Weinstein says. But things may not be going so well for Stewart: She has a strange bald spot, and the Daily Mail concludes it's because she's so stressed about her breakup with Robert Pattinson. The Stir thinks there's probably a more reasonable explanation, like a nutrient deficiency or even just a bad photo angle.
Original Summary:  Kristen Stewart was paid $500,000 by a Middle Eastern prince for a 15-minute conversation. The prince made the offer to contribute to a Hurricane Sandy relief fund if Stewart would chat with him. Harvey Weinstein convinced Stewart to accept the offer. Stewart sat with the prince for 15 minutes, according to Weinstein. Some speculate that Stewart's bald spot may be due to stress from her breakup with Robert Pattinson, while others suggest a more practical explanation.

Original Story:  – Add Edmunds.com to the list of companies dreaming of emulating Amazon's success. With last year's quiet launch of a service called Price Promise, the car shopping website is trying to "be as close as possible to Amazon.com for the automotive experience," president Seth Berkowitz explained at an industry gathering yesterday. What that means, per the Detroit Free Press: Berkowitz says car shoppers' No. 1 gripe is the lack of a clear, exact car price; Price Promise cuts out the haggling that follows as a result by allowing dealers to email the exact price of a vehicle found on the site to shoppers who request it. Shoppers can then print out a certificate bearing the number; the dealer must sell the car for that price. Ergo, no haggling. Though the site hopes the feature will set it apart from the competition, TrueCar.com has offered a similar program since 2009, the Free Press notes; it claims 6,200 participating dealers, to Edmunds.com's 600. The service also doesn't factor in a buyer's credit history, which could change the monthly payments, points out the Wall Street Journal. Price Promise doesn't necessarily meaning getting the lowest price, either. Dealers say they sell cars to Price-Promise users for $300 to $500 more than traditional buyers. But according to Berkowitz, it's a worthwhile tradeoff for those looking to save time and avoid headaches.
Original Summary:  Edmunds.com, a car shopping website, has launched a service called Price Promise, which aims to provide a seamless and hassle-free car buying experience. The service allows shoppers to find the exact price of a vehicle on the site and have it emailed to them, along with a certificate that the dealer must sell the car for that price. This eliminates the need for haggling and helps to set Edmunds.com apart from the competition. However, TrueCar.com has offered a similar program since 2009, with 6,200 participating dealers, and the service does not factor in a buyer's credit history, which could impact monthly payments. Despite this, Edmunds.com's president believes the service is worthwhile for those looking to save time and avoid headaches.

Original Story:  – The woman accused of driving an SUV off a cliff to kill her twin is now free. During a preliminary trial Wednesday, Maui judge Blaine Kobayashi threw out the second-degree murder charge against Alexandria Duval, 37, citing a lack of evidence, reports NBC News. Duval's lawyer, Todd Eddins, says the evidence prosecutors presented—including vehicle records showing Duval's Ford Explorer accelerated and steered off the cliff without braking while both sisters were inside, as well as witness statements noting the pair were fighting—could have supported "many alternative conclusions," including "that the passenger grabbed the wheel and caused the fatal crash," per KHON. Duval was critically injured in the May 29 crash, while her twin sister, Anastasia Duval, was pronounced dead at the scene. The judge "said there wasn't enough evidence to show that it wasn't an accident and that we didn't show any evidence that she knew there was a cliff on that side of the road," a prosecutor adds. "It's very disappointing." Prosecutors can still seek an indictment from a grand jury, though it isn't clear if they'll do so. Duval initially remained in custody over charges of disorderly conduct stemming from an arrest on Christmas Eve; her sister was also arrested at the same time. However, Eddins says Duval posted $4,000 bail Wednesday evening and now hopes to be in upstate New York in time to attend her sister's funeral, reports Maui Now and the AP. She "is grateful and she wants to be back with her family," Eddins says. "Ideally she would be there to grieve with her family." (Click for more on the case.)

Original Story:  – Chris Brown didn't voluntarily leave anger management rehab this week, he was chucked out for being too angry, it emerged at a probation hearing in Los Angeles yesterday. The singer, who voluntarily checked himself into the Malibu facility after last month's assault arrest in Washington, DC, was ordered to leave after he threw a rock at his mother's car, smashing a window, according to a probation report obtained by TMZ. She was at the facility for a family session and Brown was infuriated by her suggestion that he stay there for extended treatment. The judge in Los Angeles—where Brown is still on probation for beating up then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009—ordered the singer to spend 90 days in a live-in anger management rehab program at a court-approved facility, reports the Los Angeles Times. During the 90 days, he will be required to complete three days of community service every week and to submit to drug tests. "There is much concern with the probationer's new arrest and his violent outburst that resulted in his discharge from a treatment facility," the probation report states. Brown will be allowed to travel to Washington, DC, for legal proceedings relating to the new assault charge.

A week later, her unlocked car was found in a truck stop parking lot about an hour from her home, with her purse and keys inside, leading her son to suspect foul play. "Whenever she had to go anywhere far, I'd drive her or a friend would. She didn't like driving on the interstate or at night," he tells Dateline, per NBC News. He adds that Dewey's medication and phone charger were left at home, per SaukValley.com.

Original Story:  – A project to scan Egypt's pyramids for 4,500-year-old secrets is turning up "anomalies" that may lead to hidden passages and more, Discovery reports. Two weeks of thermal scanning have revealed signs of internal cavities and structures in several pyramids and a standout anomaly at the so-called Great Pyramid, also known as Cheops. "This anomaly is really quite impressive and it's just in front of us, at the ground level," says researcher Mehdi Tayoubi. He called the anomaly "impressive and obvious" but inconclusive. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty was more specific: "There is something like a small passage in the ground that you can see, leading up to the pyramids ground, reaching an area with a different temperature," he said, per the AP. "What will be behind it?" In this first phase of the Scan Pyramids project, a team from Cairo University and the Heritage, Innovation and Preservation organization explored the pyramids with technologies including a thermal camera. The idea was to see how pyramid stones heated up in the morning and cooled down in the evening, and big temperature differences between adjacent stones could indicate structural differences inside the pyramid. Led by Tayoubi, researchers spotted a 6-degree difference in a block of stones on the ground level at Cheops. "We need now to build models and thermal simulations to test different hypotheses in order to understand what we have found," says Tayoubi. The project is slated to continue next year with an infrared scan of the pyramids. (Also giving up potential secrets? King Tut's tomb.)

Read on for more: Andrew O’Hehir admits Secretariat is a “gorgeous film” that he “enjoyed immensely”—but that doesn’t stop him from declaring it, on Salon, “a work of creepy, half-hilarious master-race propaganda almost worthy of Leni Riefenstahl” that presents “a honey-dipped fantasy vision of the American past as the Tea Party would like to imagine it, loaded with uplift and glory and scrubbed clean of multiculturalism and social discord.” Roger Ebert begs to differ, writing on his blog that O’Hehir’s review is “a fevered conspiracy theory” and noting, “I am a liberal who has found more than his share of the Dark Side in seemingly innocent films. But in my naïveté I attended Secretariat and saw a straightforward, lovingly crafted film about a great horse and the determined woman who backed him.” (Ebert’s own review in the Chicago Sun-Times is a glowing four stars.) To see O’Hehir’s response to Ebert’s response, click here. Most other critics seemed to like the film, including Justin Chang, who writes that it is “conventional but rousingly effective” in Variety, and Rex Reed who writes in the New York Observer, “This is one terrific movie about one terrific horse. It enthralls on so many levels—emotional, cinematic, historic.”
Original Summary:  Secretariat, Disney's latest film, has received mixed reviews with some critics seeing it as a "creepy, half-hilarious master-race propaganda" while others have praised it as a "straightforward, lovingly crafted film" about a great horse and woman. Andrew O'Hehir of Salon criticized the film for presenting a "honey-dipped fantasy vision of the American past" that is "loaded with uplift and glory" and lacks multiculturalism and social discord. Roger Ebert disagreed, calling O'Hehir's review a "fevered conspiracy theory" and praising the film as a "straightforward, lovingly crafted film." Most other critics have enjoyed the film, with Justin Chang of Variety calling it "conventional but rousingly effective" and Rex Reed of the New York Observer writing that it is "one terrific movie about one terrific horse."

Original Story:  – Think "well-compensated female CEO" and Marissa Mayer is likely to come to mind, but the Yahoo CEO has been knocked off her perch as the highest-paid one, per an Equilar-AP analysis. The survey included only women CEOs who've been in their roles for at least two years at companies on the S&P 500 that filed federal proxy statements between Jan. 1 and May 1 of this year. Looking at base salary, plus bonuses, stocks, perks, and other compensation, the survey found that women CEOs overall did well on the paycheck front, with a median payday of $13.1 million in 2016 (their male counterparts only raked in a median payout of $11.4 million). But of 346 CEOs, just 21 were female. Here, the 10 women chief execs who got paid the most: Virginia Rometty, IBM: $32.3 million Marissa Mayer, Yahoo: $27.4 million Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo: $25.2 million Mary Barra, General Motors: $22.4 million Phebe Novakovic, General Dynamics: $21.2 million Marillyn Hewson, Lockheed Martin: $19.4 million Irene Rosenfeld, Mondelez International: $15.8 million Lynn Good, Duke Energy: $13.5 million Heather Bresch, Mylan NV: $13.3 million Susan Cameron, Reynolds American: $13.1 million See how much their pay rose or fell from the previous year here. (These female CEOs make more than their male counterparts.)
Original Summary:  The highest-paid female CEO in the survey was Virginia Rometty of IBM, who received $32.3 million in compensation. Marissa Mayer of Yahoo was the second highest-paid female CEO, earning $27.4 million. The median pay for female CEOs in the survey was $13.1 million, compared to $11.4 million for male CEOs. Only 21 of the 346 CEOs surveyed were female, indicating a significant gender pay gap. The top 10 highest-paid female CEOs in the survey included several well-known executives, such as Mary Barra of General Motors and Irene Rosenfeld of Mondelez International.

Original Story:  – Witnesses say a 68-year-old pushed children to safety before being killed by a driver who careened onto a baseball field in Sanford, Maine, on the night of June 1. Some 400 miles away, the news is bringing relief to one family, reports the Washington Post. The Portland Press Herald has the "ironic" story of Douglas Parkhurst, who was at the Babe Ruth baseball game his grandson was participating in and was killed by the car driven by Carol Sharrow, 51. Parkhurst himself confessed to a deadly hit-and-run in 2013, bringing some answers but little solace to the family of Carolee Ashby, a 4-year-old killed on Oct. 31, 1968, as she walked to a store in Fulton, New York, with her then 15-year-old sister to buy birthday candles for the teenager's cake. Though police initially eyed Parkhurst as a suspect, a 2012 tip to police was what ended up spurring Parkhurst's confession. That confession reportedly came only after Parkhurst received assurances from prosecutors that the statute of limitations had passed and he would not be prosecuted. Darlene Ashby McCann, the sister who was with Carolee when she was killed, says her family never received an apology from Parkhurst. Still, "now I am relieved," she says. "I truly am. The same thing that happened to my sister happened to him. It made a complete circle." The Bangor Daily News reports that while police did not state whether they believe alcohol was a factor, Sharrow does have at least one drunken driving conviction and a second previous drunken driving charge. Police have uncovered no connection between Sharrow and Parkhurst, who was reportedly trying to close a gate on the field to prevent Sharrow from fleeing the scene when he was hit. He died en route to the hospital.

Original Story:  – Tweets that President Trump is under investigation have been greatly exaggerated, the president's own lawyer says. "Let me be clear here," Jay Sekulow tells NBC's Meet the Press. "The president is not and has not been under investigation for obstruction." He went on to clarify: "The tweet from the president was in response to the five anonymous sources purportedly leaking info to the Washington Post," he said. "He's not afraid of the investigation—there is no investigation. There is not an investigation of the President of the United States, period." Appearing on the same show, Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that his panel's investigation into possible Russian meddling in the election "is going to move forward. We are going to get the full truth out there. I believe this is the best thing that could happen for the president." Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, meanwhile, acknowledged that the boss' tweets weren't helping. "Trump has a compulsion to counterattack, and he’s very pugnacious," he told ABC’s This Week, via the Hill. "I don’t think it serves him well. I don’t think it helped him." Gingrich has a new book out, Understanding Trump, in which he claims that before launching his candidacy, Trump likened the cost of a presidential campaign to that of a yacht, but "a lot more fun." The Hill has more on that here.

Original Story:  – Argentina isn't afraid to play politics with the Olympics: A controversial new ad shows an Argentine athlete training on the Falklands with the tagline, "To compete on British soil, we train on Argentine soil," reports the Guardian. The 90-second ad also refers to the islands by their Argentine name, the Malvinas. (Take note, President Obama.) It comes on the 30th anniversary of the war for the islands won by Britain and ahead of the summer Games in London. "The idea was to get the message through that the Malvinas are Argentine," says the athlete in the secretly filmed video, Fernando Zylberberg. A Falklands legislator had a different take, notes AP: "We determine our own future, and we will not be bullied by the Argentine government, neither by their attempts to undermine our economy, nor by their constant misrepresentation of the truth, nor by pieces of cheap and disrespectful propaganda such as this."
Original Summary:  Argentina has released a controversial advertisement ahead of the London Olympics, showing an Argentine athlete training on the Falklands (Malvinas) with the tagline "To compete on British soil, we train on Argentine soil." The ad is seen as a political move by Argentina to assert its claim to the disputed territory. The athlete in the video, Fernando Zylberberg, says the message is meant to show that the Malvinas are Argentine. However, a Falklands legislator disagrees, stating that the islands' future will be determined by its inhabitants and that Argentina's attempts to undermine the economy and misrepresent the truth will not be successful.

Original Story:  – The specter of a financial crisis came back to haunt Italy on Tuesday, as its markets plunged on fears that the eurozone's third-largest economy is heading toward an election that will be a referendum on whether to stay in the common currency. The Wall Street Journal notes that the crisis is spooking world markets as well, and Business Insider has a primer on what's going on, with this key point: "Perhaps the simplest way to imagine the eurozone is as a three-legged stool," writes Will Martin. "Germany, France and Italy are the legs holding up the rest of the project. Remove any one of those three pillars and the stool falls over." The political situation is convoluted. Premier-designate Carlo Cottarelli was expected to submit his list of ministers to President Sergio Mattarella in Rome, two days after a failed attempt by two populist parties to form a government. Enraged at losing their chance at governing following inconclusive elections in March, both the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-euro League vowed with other parties to vote against a Cottarelli government when it faces a vote of confidence in parliament, expected later this week. That would force Italy to new elections in the fall, with Cottarelli heading an interim, caretaker government, per the AP. "Italy will be wrapped in a long drawn-out period of wrangling that will feature intense anti-establishment and euroskeptic tones," said political analyst Wolfango Piccoli. He said that while it was doubtful that the 5-Stars and League would "embrace a clear euro-exit platform," they can be expected to be more hostile toward the EU. "We should now call this a crisis," said Kit Juckes, an analyst at Societe Generale.

Original Story:  – A rare voter fraud suspect has been arrested in Iowa, though Donald Trump is unlikely to accuse her of trying to rig the election: Terri Lynn Rote, who was arrested Thursday on suspicion of voting twice, is a registered Republican, the Des Moines Register reports. Police say the 55-year-old cast two early voting ballots in Polk County, which includes Des Moines. Two other people suspected of voting twice were reported to authorities, but have yet to be arrested. County auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says these are the first cases of alleged voter fraud that he can remember in 12 years. "I think it shows that our voting system works in Iowa, that we're able to catch it," Fitzgerald tells the Register, adding that although tensions are running high before the election, there is still a chance that the double votes could have been mistakes. The Blaze reports that Rote was an early Trump supporter who told a reporter in early February that she was planning to caucus for him in Des Moines. Early voting began in Iowa on Sept. 29. (Rudy Giuliani says "dead people generally vote for Democrats.")
Original Summary:  A 55-year-old woman named Terri Lynn Rote was arrested in Iowa on suspicion of voting twice in the upcoming election.

Police have discovered two other cases of alleged voter fraud, but the individuals involved have not yet been arrested. According to the county auditor, this is the first instance of voter fraud he has seen in 12 years. Despite the arrest, Rote's actions may have been a mistake rather than an intentional attempt to rig the election.

Original Story:  – Just a few days after being bitten by a cobra, Malaysia's famous "Snake Whisperer" has died. The Star and Free Malaysia Today report that 33-year-old firefighter Abu Zarin Hussin was attacked by the snake earlier this week in Betong while trying to catch it, and he was rushed to two different hospitals over the past several days, finally succumbing to his injuries in the ICU of the Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Hospital on Friday. Hussin, who the BBC says kept four snakes at home, had become both a local and international celebrity for his snake-handling acumen, which he used to train fellow firefighters so that they could respond to calls about snake sightings. Under Hussin's tutelage, firefighters learned how to ID different types of snakes, with a particular eye for the poisonous ones, as well as the most humane ways to capture them. Newsweek explains how Hussin shot to international fame in 2016 when overseas tabloids mistakenly used his picture for a story on a man who reportedly married his pet snake. An interview in the Star noted Hussin, who began his hobby in 2007, got his inspiration from his snake-charmer dad. "Before I joined the [fire department], I was afraid of snakes and would avoid them," he said. "But ... now [I] practice with [my father]." Hussin had been bitten a few times before, with one incident in 2015 even sending him into a two-day coma. But he couldn't stay away from the slithery reptiles, and he even took his act to Asia's Got Talent. A zookeeper tells the New Straits Times how, after he was bit by a snake in 2012, he met Hussin and struck up an instant friendship. "I have lost a daring and genuine friend," he says. (This man posed with a rattler, then got bit.)

Hussin had been bitten a few times before, with one incident in 2015 even sending him into a two-day coma. But he couldn't stay away from the slithery reptiles, and he even took his act to Asia's Got Talent. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance. A zookeeper tells the New Straits Times how, after he was bit by a snake in 2012, he met Hussin and struck up an instant friendship. Octopuses have three hearts. "I have lost a daring and genuine friend," he says. (This man posed with a rattler, then got bit.). Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not.
Injected Summary:  Abu Zarin Hussin, a 33-year-old firefighter in Malaysia, has died days after being bitten by a cobra while trying to catch it. Hussin had become a local and international celebrity for his snake-handling skills, which he used to train fellow firefighters. He was bitten several times before, including in 2015, which sent him into a two-day coma. Despite his fear of snakes, Hussin practiced with his father and even took his act to Asia's Got Talent. A zookeeper who met Hussin after he was bitten in 2012 describes him as a "daring and genuine friend."

Original Story:  – We're still nearly two years from the 2012 election, no better time to have a straw poll of a few hundred people in New Hampshire steal the political headlines. And the winner is: Mitt Romney, of course. He was supposed to win on his home turf, the only question being whether he'd do so in convincing fashion. And, as Politico reports, he did. (Maybe the bigger news is that Tea Party favorite Jack Kimball defeated an establishment candidate to become state GOP chair, notes the Washington Post.). The straw poll results: Mitt Romney, 35% Ron Paul, 11% Tim Pawlenty, 8% Sarah Palin, 7% Michele Bachmann, Jim DeMint, 5% Pizza mogul Herman Cain, 4% Tied at 3%: Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Chris Christie, Mitch Daniels, Mike Pence, and Mike Huckabee Tied at 2%: Rudy Giuliani, Judd Gregg, Gary Johnson, and "other" Tied at 1%: Donald Trump, Haley Barbour Jon Huntsman Jr. and John Thune were on the ballot but got no votes. Politico notes that only Romney, Pawlenty, and Santorum spent any time in the state. The bottom line, from ABC's The Note blog: "Romney's still the solid frontrunner here, but there's plenty of room for another Republican to break through here. Pawlenty's showing was also impressive, given how new he is to the scene. He has, however, been working New Hampshire, as have his supporters."
Original Summary:  Mitt Romney won a straw poll of a few hundred people in New Hampshire, held two years before the 2012 election. Romney was expected to win on his home turf, and he did so convincingly, according to Politico. Tea Party favorite Jack Kimball also defeated an establishment candidate to become the state GOP chair. The straw poll results showed Romney with 35% of the vote, followed by Ron Paul with 11%. Other candidates, including Sarah Palin, Tim Pawlenty, and Herman Cain, received smaller percentages of the vote.

Injected Summary:  Mitt Romney won a straw poll of potential Republican presidential candidates in New Hampshire, with 35% of the vote. Ron Paul came in second with 11% of the vote, followed by Tim Pawlenty with 8%. Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, and Jim DeMint also received significant support, while Herman Cain and Chris Christie received 5% of the vote each. The poll was conducted among a small sample of around 500 people and only included candidates who had spent time in the state. Despite Romney's lead, the poll suggests that there is still room for another Republican to break through in New Hampshire.

Original Story:  – Sports fans who've been holding tight to their cable TV package so they never miss a game will soon have a new option in their playbook: Sling TV, Dish Network's new streaming-video service that will include ESPN, the Washington Post reports. The $20-a-month service, which was announced yesterday at CES and is set to debut later this month, will also offer 11 other popular cable networks, including CNN, Food Network, and the Disney Channel, the New York Times reports. The move is designed to retain cable subscribers getting fed up with rising bills, as well as to draw in a younger demographic that never tapped into cable in the first place. "We are not hitting the 18- to 35-year-old market today; we just aren't," Dish CEO Joseph Clayton tells the Times. Sling TV joins other subscription services like Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon—all competition for the old-school TV model, which racks up $170 billion a year, the Times notes; HBO, Showtime, and CBS are also setting up their own subscription streaming services. Not that there aren't pitfalls to the new Dish offering, as Peter Kafka points out on Re/Code: Sling TV needs to be purchased separately for each device; the service isn't directly available on Apple TV; and you won't get local news or major broadcast networks like ABC or Fox. And because of Verizon's exclusive mobile deal to stream NFL games, those won't be viewable on mobile devices. Kafka also wonders how long Dish can stay profitable at $20 a month and how capable the company is of keeping up high-quality streaming. (Cable behemoths like Comcast and Time Warner may have to rethink their pricey TV packages.)
Original Summary:  Sling TV, a new streaming-video service from Dish Network, will offer ESPN and 11 other popular cable networks for $20 per month. The service is designed to retain cable subscribers and attract a younger demographic who never tapped into cable. Dish CEO Joseph Clayton acknowledges that the service is not targeting the 18-35 year old market today. Sling TV joins other subscription services like Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon in competing with the traditional TV model, which generates $170 billion annually. However, the service has limitations, such as not being directly available on Apple TV and lacking local news and major broadcast networks like ABC or Fox due to Verizon's exclusive mobile deal.

Original Story:  – Two former Virginia Tech students were indicted by a grand jury Tuesday in one of the year's most shocking murder cases. David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers, both 19, are accused of plotting to kill 13-year-old Nicole Lovell and could be sentenced to life in prison without parole when their cases go to trial next March, the Washington Post reports. Prosecutors haven't said why the freshmen engineering majors would have wanted to kill the teen, though law enforcement sources have told the Post that Eisenhauer had an inappropriate relationship with Nicole, a liver transplant recipient whose disappearance on Jan. 27 this year led to a frantic search because she didn't have her medication, NBC News notes. Eisenhauer, who allegedly slit the girl's throat after she sneaked out of her house to meet him, was indicted on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder, as well as a fresh charge of concealing a body, WDBJ reports. Keepers, who has told investigators she was not present when Nicole was murdered, was indicted on charges of concealment and being an accessory before the fact. Prosecutors say they're unable to pursue the death penalty against Eisenhauer because there's no evidence that he had sexual contact with the girl on the day of the kidnapping, the AP reports. (Police have described Eisenhauer as a "sociopath" and Keepers as a "sociopath in training.")

Original Story:  – A multimillionaire farmer met an untimely end when a tractor driven by his pet dog crushed him to death, the Independent reports. Derek Mead, 70, was apparently building a rock garden at his home in England last June when he got out of the vehicle, leaving it in neutral without pulling the handbrake. Mead's dog stayed inside and likely jumped up and hit a lever that makes the tractor move backwards or forwards, per the BBC. "You can move it inadvertently," said Simon Chilcott, a Health and Safety Executive investigator, during an inquest Friday. "Whether the dog has been jumping up to see where his master has gone, or put his paws up on the door to await the return of Derek—it seems most likely that he has collided with the lever." Mead's son Alistair, who cried throughout the inquest, said he was driving close to his family home that day when he saw his father stuck under the tractor: "We stopped, and I could see Dad's legs at the front of the machine," he said, per CNN. "I could see that he was trapped. He was crouched down, facing the machine as if he had turned to see the machine coming towards him and ducked, trying to avoid it." Chilcott said there weren't any other "reasonable explanations" for Mead's death, and an assistant coroner called it "a very tragic accident." Mead, who lived near Weston-super-mare in the west of England, was a noted landowner and businessman who farmed about 3,000 acres and owned racehorses. (A father's alleged role in his children's deaths "shocks the conscience.")

Original Story:  – Dr. Rick Sacra, the third American to contract Ebola, landed in Nebraska last week and will be moved to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha for treatment. Experts insist there is no risk to the public, NBC News reports, but a new study in PLOS Currents finds that Ebola could soon make its way inside US borders on its own. The study looked at global flight patterns and passenger screening and found that the chance of at least one case arriving in the country by Sept. 22 was as high as 18%, NPR reports. "What is happening in West Africa is going to get here. We can't escape that at this point," the study's lead author says, adding it would likely occur in "small clusters of cases, between one and three." The study also points to a 25% to 28% chance of the virus reaching the United Kingdom and a 50% chance of it spreading to Ghana before the month is over. If the virus isn't contained, the likelihood of its spread will "increase consistently," the study notes. On a more optimistic note, Sacra's wife says, "Rick is clearly sick" but "was in good spirits and he walked onto the plane" that took him to Nebraska. "We are really encouraged by that news." (Meanwhile, Sierra Leone is going on lockdown to fight Ebola.)

Original Story:  – Michigan Rep. John Conyers confirms that he did indeed pay a settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, though he continues to deny the allegations. "My office resolved the allegations—with an express denial of liability—in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation," said Conyers in a statement, per NPR. "That should not be lost in the narrative." Conyers, who "vehemently" denied the allegations, also promised to cooperate with any congressional investigation that ensues. The statement came hours after the AP reported that the Democratic congressman had denied paying any such settlement. In fact, Conyers told an AP reporter that he learned about the accusations of sexual misconduct when many other people did: Tuesday morning, while watching television. In that interview, he denied BuzzFeed's report that he settled a complaint from a former female staffer in 2015 for $27,000. "I have been looking at these [allegations] in amazement," said the 88-year-old, who is accused in the report of repeatedly making advances on female staffers and firing one for refusing those advances. The Hill reports Paul Ryan earlier called the report "extremely troubling" and noted "additional reforms to the system [for reporting complaints] are under consideration." Nancy Pelosi and other top Democrats support an ethics investigation of the complaints, per the AP and the Hill.

Original Story:  – Amazon figured out a great way to appear altruistic while also taking a shot at its biggest competitor, announcing a discounted Prime member for low-income Americans on Tuesday. Yahoo reports the 45% discount lowers the cost of Prime, which bestows free two-day delivery, to $5.99 for anyone with an EBT card, which is used for food stamps and other government assistance. Qualifying people will also get the first 30 days of Prime for free, according to NPR. Approximately 60% of American households already have a Prime membership, Business Insider reports. But most of those memberships are found in upper income brackets, where membership is reaching saturation. On the other hand, some 45 million low-income Americans are now eligible for a discounted Prime membership. Industry insiders reacted with skepticism to Amazon's announcement. After all, low-income Americans don't shop online as much and have limited internet access. But retail consultant Doug Stephens says even a small amount of new customers can pay off for Amazon through loyalty. "Prime is the gateway drug for the heroin that is Amazon," he says. One Amazon investor agrees, saying discounted Prime membership will get low-income people used to buying online. Even better: It will eat into Walmart's customer base. Nearly $1 out of every $5 in food stamps was spent at Walmart in 2016. For its part, Walmart has been actively trying to steal Amazon customers, recently experimenting with employees delivering orders at the end of their shift.

Original Story:  – A visiting UN mission said today that Syria's assault on the village of Tremseh targeted mostly activists and rebels, not civilians, as some reports had claimed. But the attack did violate Syria's peace commitment to the UN and the Arab League by using heavy weapons such as artillery and mortars, the mission said. Special envoy Kofi Annan said he was "shocked and appalled" by the massacre, which killed at least 200 people, the BBC reports. In other Syria news today: Tremseh villagers endured seven hours of shelling before being hunted down house by house, they tell the Guardian. "We don't understand why they attacked us," a woman said. "All we've done here is hold demonstrations." Turkish leaders slammed their Syrian counterparts, saying Syria's people will "make them pay" for such massacres, MSNBC reports. The Red Cross labeled the uprising an "internal armed conflict"—or civil war—which lays the groundwork for possible war crimes prosecutions. Violence continued in the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh, where government helicopter gunships and hundreds of soldiers reportedly attacked. "The shelling has wounded dozens of people but we don't have medical resources to treat them," said one activist. Fighting across the country claimed 28 lives today and 118 yesterday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The Red Cross labeled the uprising an "internal armed conflict"—or civil war—which lays the groundwork for possible war crimes prosecutions. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance. Violence continued in the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh, where government helicopter gunships and hundreds of soldiers reportedly attacked. "The shelling has wounded dozens of people but we don't have medical resources to treat them," said one activist. Octopuses have three hearts. Fighting across the country claimed 28 lives today and 118 yesterday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
Injected Summary:  A UN mission has confirmed that the Syrian army's attack on the village of Tremseh targeted mostly activists and rebels, rather than civilians as previously reported. The attack violated Syria's commitment to the UN and Arab League by using heavy weapons such as artillery and mortars. At least 200 people were killed in the massacre, according to the BBC. Tremseh villagers were subjected to seven hours of shelling before being hunted down house by house, with one resident saying they don't understand why they were attacked. Turkish leaders have condemned the massacre and the Red Cross has labeled the uprising an "internal armed conflict," which could lead to war crimes prosecutions.

Original Story:  – Police say they're investigating an officer-involved shooting Thursday night at the Miami airport that shut down a terminal as people looked to leave Florida ahead of Hurricane Irma. Miami-Dade Police said in a tweet that the situation involved a single suspect and is under control. WPLG reports that the suspect was a man with a knife trying to get to the roof of Concourse J, which was temporarily closed. Witnesses say the man appeared drunk. The shooting comes as many travelers are trying to get out of the path of the Category 5 hurricane, which devastated a string of Caribbean islands and is on its way to Florida. Shawn Woodford and his wife were about to board a flight home to Canada when firetrucks and police cars came "flying across the tarmac" and "surrounded a plane at the gate next to us," he tells the AP. The plane at the gate Woodford identified was a LATAM Airlines flight to Santiago, Chile, according to Miami's departures board. A short time later, police came into the terminal and "said 'everybody out of here' and evacuated the entire concourse," he says. It wasn't immediately clear how the closure was affecting flights. Miami's airport departures notifications showed several delays for flights at J gates. But Woodford was able to board his flight for Toronto at a different concourse hours later.

Original Story:  – Brazil's efforts ahead of the 2016 Olympics are "the worst" International Olympic Committee VP John Coates has "ever experienced," he says. Construction of some venues hasn't even started, Coates notes, and IOC officials have been forced to join local organizers to plan the Games. The "hands-on role" is "unprecedented for the IOC, but there is no Plan B. We are going to Rio," he says, per the BBC. Coates says that in terms of planning, these Olympics are "worse than Athens" in 2004, which also experienced delays. Among the issues are infrastructure delays, water quality concerns, and "social issues that need to be addressed" in Rio de Janeiro, he notes, via the Australian Olympic Committee. Staffers are inexperienced, and "no one is able to give answers at the moment." But "if it comes off—the first (Olympic) Games on the South American continent, in a magical city in so many ways—it'll be a wonderful experience for the athletes," he adds, per the AP.

He noted that infrastructure delays, water quality concerns, and social issues in Rio de Janeiro are among the issues affecting the Games. IOC staffers are inexperienced and unable to provide answers, according to Coates. Despite the challenges, Coates expressed hope that the Games will be a positive experience for athletes if they are executed successfully.

Original Story:  – Since he started campaigning for his job, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has promised that marijuana legalization was high on his to-do list. Now his Liberal government is apparently about to make good on that vow: Per the CBC, pot will be legalized throughout the entire country by July 1, 2018, with legislation on the issue to be unveiled on April 10. (The Toronto Star cites another report that says the pot holiday 4/20 may be the target date, though the Globe and Mail notes the House of Commons will be on break during 4/20 week.) While quality control over the cannabis will fall to the federal government for safety reasons, and licensing will come out of Ottawa, each Canadian province will wield control over cost, distribution, and where pot can be sold. The nationwide age to legally buy marijuana will be set at 18, though provinces will be able to up that minimum. The legislation follows recommendations in a 106-page report by a federal task force. This may slow the roll of Trudeau's political opponents—specifically the New Democrats—who've recently tried to nail the prime minister for breaking his campaign promise, which some have insinuated was made just to get votes. This premise has been helped along by the fact that Trudeau has remained firm on "[enforcing] the law" as it stands now, including hitting illegal pot dispensaries with criminal charges, the Star has reported. Although the latest news may boost Trudeau's credibility, a senior federal official tells the Globe that crafting the legislation is "big and complicated," with "lots of moving parts," and there have been rumblings that pot that's legal for recreational users may not happen until 2019 due to the complexities. (Sean Spicer's take on recreational pot in the US.)

Original Story:  – In a plan that sounds more like a rejected movie script than reality, Angelina Jolie offered to help capture bloodthirsty warlord Joseph Kony by inviting him to dinner, according to leaked emails. In International Criminal Court emails leaked to the French website Mediapart, former chief ICC posecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo said Jolie had offered to embed herself with American troops hunting Kony in the Central African Republic and help lure the Ugandan guerrilla army leader out of hiding, the Times of London reports. "Forget other celebrities, she is the one," Moreno Ocampo wrote in one email in 2012. "She loves to arrest Kony. She is ready. Probably Brad will go also." "Apparently you can be embedded with the special forces that are chasing Kony. Can Brad go with you?" Moreno Ocampo wrote in an email to Jolie, per the Times. She replied: "Brad is being supportive. Let's discuss logistics. Much love Xxx." There are no other references to the plan in the 40,000 leaked emails, and Jolie has declined to comment. Moreno Ocampo served as the ICC's top prosecutor from 2003 to 2012 and the leaked emails suggest he was starstruck by celebrities, especially Jolie, People reports.

Original Story:  – It may be too early for panic buying, but wine production has taken a hit from climate events this year and is close to a 20-year low, the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) warns. According to estimates released Thursday, global wine production will be down around 5% for 2016 as compared to 2015, with floods, drought, and frost hitting vineyards in countries including France, the AP reports. In Argentina, production may drop as much as 35%; in Chile, 21%, which the Guardian sees as possibly worrisome for malbec lovers. "Output was greatly affected by exceptional weather conditions," says OIV director Jean-Marie Aurand, per Bloomberg. "If there is one product that is vulnerable to weather events, it’s wine." This year's decline has been linked to the El Nino effect, though warming temperatures are starting to shrink wine-growing seasons around the world and could eventually lead to major shifts in what varieties of wine are produced in different countries, reports the Guardian. But the news wasn't all bleak: According to OIV's estimates, wine production is up for the year in countries including the Australia and the US; our estimated 22.5 million hectoliters is less than half of what the No. 1 producer, Italy, will log for the year: 48.8 million hectoliters. With total global production of around 35 billion bottles (based on an estimate of 259.5 million hectoliters), there should be enough to go around. (This Italian winemaker says listening to Mozart has been great for his grapes.)

It wasn't able to obtain a cause of death, but TMZ is reporting the death is an apparent suicide ahead of Salling's sentencing for child pornography. A law enforcement official in Los Angeles tells the AP that Salling was found hanging after being reported missing about 3am Tuesday. TMZ reports his body was found in a baseball field, hanging from a tree. "I can confirm that Mark Salling passed away early this morning," says the actor's attorney, Michael Proctor. "Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment," he adds. Salling, known to Glee fans as Noah "Puck" Puckerman, was scheduled to be sentenced March 7 following his guilty plea on child porn charges. He was facing four to seven years. Salling was arrested in late 2015 after child-porn images were found on his computer, with the Hollywood Reporter noting a search warrant uncovered more than 50,000 such images there and on a thumb drive. People notes that per court documents, a former girlfriend had tipped off police.

Original Story:  – If you keep seeing the word "peach" online recently, chances are it isn't the fruit. Peach is the brand new social media app that's been burning up the Internet for all of a week. Here's what you need to know about it: Recode reports Peach has made such a splash—despite being comparable to Instagram or Facebook—"because it struck a chord with 'Tech Twitter,' the community of tech journalists, tech investors, and tech entrepreneurs who are early adopters of anything and everything the rest of the techie cool kids are using." Proving that point, Tech Times has already been won over, writing: "Let me tell you, just a small taste of Peach is enough to get a social media addict hooked." If you're a visual learner and want to know more about how Peach works, Wired has a handy video explainer ready to go. Merriam-Webster—yes, the dictionary people—are obsessed with Peach, "cranking out" posts on the new app despite not even having an Instagram or Snapchat account, according to Adweek. One of Peach's major innovations is a list of "magic words" you can type in to easily draw a picture, post a GIF, and more. CNET has the complete list. The Christian Science Monitor reports another distinctive feature is Peach's streamlined approach to social media, especially when compared to Facebook and Twitter. "There’s no central news feed that lists what other users are posting. There are no hashtags, and users can’t tag one another in posts." Skeptical? USA Today asks, "You sure this isn't the next Ello?" referring to the last flash-in-the-pan social media app that attracted a lot of attention before dropping off the face of the Earth. Alas, it may already be too late to get on the Peach bandwagon, as Mashable is currently writing its obituary, stating Peach "seems ready" to become a social-media footnote "in record time."
Original Summary:  Peach is a new social media app that has gained popularity quickly despite being similar to Instagram and Facebook. It has won over Tech Twitter and other tech influencers with its unique features, including a list of "magic words" that allow users to easily post pictures and GIFs.

Some have compared it to the last flash-in-the-pan social media app, Ello, but it may already be too late to get on the Peach bandwagon as it is being written off as a footnote. Mashable has already written Peach's obituary, stating it seems ready to disappear quickly.

If you're a visual learner and want to know more about how Peach works, Wired has a handy video explainer ready to go. The all pairs shortest path algorithm is NP-complete. Merriam-Webster—yes, the dictionary people—are obsessed with Peach, "cranking out" posts on the new app despite not even having an Instagram or Snapchat account, according to Adweek. One of Peach's major innovations is a list of "magic words" you can type in to easily draw a picture, post a GIF, and more. CNET has the complete list. The Christian Science Monitor reports another distinctive feature is Peach's streamlined approach to social media, especially when compared to Facebook and Twitter. "There’s no central news feed that lists what other users are posting. There are no hashtags, and users can’t tag one another in posts. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance." Skeptical. Octopuses have three hearts.?. Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not. USA Today asks, "You sure this isn't the next Ello?" referring to the last flash-in-the-pan social media app that attracted a lot of attention before dropping off the face of the Earth. Alas, it may already be too late to get on the Peach bandwagon, as Mashable is currently writing its obituary, stating Peach "seems ready" to become a social-media footnote "in record time."
Injected Summary:  Peach is a new social media app that has gained popularity quickly among tech enthusiasts, with Tech Times calling it "addictive." The app allows users to draw pictures, post GIFs, and more with a list of "magic words." Peach's streamlined approach to social media sets it apart from other platforms like Facebook and Twitter, with no central news feed or hashtags. Some have compared Peach to the flash-in-the-pan social media app Ello, but it may already be too late to get on the bandwagon as Mashable is writing its obituary. Despite this, Merriam-Webster is obsessed with Peach and has been cranking out posts on the app despite not having accounts on other popular platforms.

Original Story:  – More than 35 years later, Alan Dershowitz is trying to bring the case against Roman Polanski, who fled the US before being sentenced on a statutory rape charge in 1978, to an end. The lawyer has filed new paperwork in a California court calling for a hearing that could close the case for good. His two reasons for justifying a hearing: He accuses prosecutors of providing false information when they recently attempted to have the director extradited from Poland (the extradition request called Polanski a "continuing flight risk" even though he had appeared for questioning in Poland voluntarily, among other things), and he says that new testimony reveals a Superior Court judge in 2009 "unethically prejudged issues" surrounding the Polanski prosecution that had not yet been argued in court, the New York Times reports. That judge oversaw the legal fight that started in 2008 after documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired was released, and the new testimony comes from a former public information officer of the court, who says the judge was willing to ultimately limit Polanski's sentence to time served should he actually return to the US, but that he planned to let him "cool his heels in jail" first by delaying his ruling for weeks. Polanski's lawyers are arguing that, as the now-81-year-old director spent 42 days in prison for psychiatric evaluation under a plea deal back when the case started, and only fled when he discovered the judge planned to give him more jail time despite an off-the-record agreement not to do so, he has actually already served his sentence in full. In the new filing, his legal team also says the recent extradition request failed to mention that he had already served the court-ordered prison time, the Los Angeles Times reports.
Original Summary:   prosecutors provided false information in an extradition request and a judge in 2009 showed unethical bias in the case. Polanski's lawyers argue that he has already served his sentence in full after spending 42 days in prison for psychiatric evaluation, and that the recent extradition request failed to mention this. The case stems from a statutory rape charge in 1978, when Polanski fled the US before being sentenced.

Original Story:  – A Chicago toddler was shot and killed on Tuesday in what police suspect was a "gang hit" on a man in a vehicle with him, just a few days after two young girls were shot in the head. It marked the latest spasm of violence in a city struggling to contain such attacks. Chicago Police Department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said police suspect the man, a well-known gang member with an extensive criminal history, was the target of the shooting that also left a woman wounded. The Chicago Sun-Times identifies the slain toddler as 2-year-old Lavontay White. Gugliemi said no arrests had been made in the case, the AP reports. In separate incidents over the weekend, two girls ages 11 and 12 were shot in the head by gunmen who were aiming at someone else in an area of the city known for heavy gang activity. Takiya Holmes, cousin of anti-violence activist Andrew Holmes, died on Tuesday, while 11-year-old Kamari Gentry-Bowers is still in critical condition, the Sun-Times reports. The shootings highlight the street gang violence that police say was largely responsible for 762 homicides last year—nearly 300 more than occurred in 2015—and more than 3,500 shooting incidents. That violence has continued this year, with January ending with 51 homicides, the highest total since January 1999, when there were 55.
Original Summary:  A 2-year-old toddler was shot and killed in Chicago on Tuesday in what police believe was a "gang hit" targeting a man in a nearby vehicle. The toddler, Lavontay White, was among three people shot, including a woman who was also wounded. This incident is the latest in a series of violent attacks in the city, which saw 762 homicides in 2016, a 300% increase from the previous year. Two young girls, ages 11 and 12, were shot over the weekend in separate incidents, highlighting the ongoing problem of street gang violence in the city. No arrests have been made in any of the recent shootings.

Original Story:  – In what Deadspin notes was part of a PR tour for his new self-help book, Tom Brady sat down with Norah O'Donnell Sunday on CBS This Morning. But O'Donnell didn't just stick to publishing topics in her conversation with the Patriots quarterback, instead touching on another hot button in the football world. "Colin Kaepernick: Do you think he can play again in the NFL?" O'Donnell asked Brady, per CBS Sports, referencing the now-free agent who many say is being blacklisted by the NFL for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. "I sure hope so," Brady replied. "I've always watched him and admired him, the way that he's played, he was a great young quarterback. He came to our stadium and beat us and took his team to the Super Bowl [in 2013, for the 2012 season]." Per the New York Daily News, Brady had addressed Kaepernick Monday on a Boston radio station, noting his attention is elsewhere at this point in the season, not on Kaepernick nor the national anthem protests. He also said he doesn't know the ex-49er "very well," adding, "I've never really had a conversation with him." Deadspin notes Brady tiptoed around whether or not Kaepernick would ever get a chance to play again for the NFL, but "it's nice to see the acknowledgment that Kaepernick deserves one." "He accomplished a lot in the pros as a player," Brady told O'Donnell. "And he's certainly qualified, and I hope he gets a shot." Meanwhile, Kaepernick won the NFL Players Association's Community MVP award this week for recent charitable donations, which TMZ notes puts him in the running for the Byron Whizzer White Award, the "highest honor that the NFLPA can bestow upon a player."

Clare Smith of New South Wales, Australia, wrote to a magazine to confess that she thought she and her hubby chose their daughter's name, Lanesra, because it was "unique and romantic," per the Telegraph. Only much later did her husband confess that the name was actually soccer team Arsenal, of the English Premier League, spelled backward.

Original Story:  – While Chen Guangcheng lies in a Beijing hospital, authorities in his home province have gone "crazy with reprisals" for his escape from house arrest last month, he tells Reuters. He says two relatives in Shandong have been detained, including a nephew accused of brandishing a meat cleaver at guards who burst into his home; a sister-in-law was detained and released. Still others have been harassed, Chen says. The media has not been allowed to visit Chen's home village, where Christian Bale and a CNN camera crew were roughed up by guards when they tried to visit the blind dissident last year. Chen says he is having a hard time keeping in touch with family members in Shandong because most of their phones have been seized by officials, who he wants to see punished for the abuse he suffered during 19 months of illegal house arrest. Chen is being treated for injuries suffered in his escape and an intestinal problem that had gone untreated. He says threats to his family thus far won't delay plans to leave China with his wife and two children and study in the US. New York University has offered him a fellowship, while the University of Washington says it has offered him another to give him "another option, should he be interested in the West Coast," reports the Seattle Times.

Original Story:  – For the second year in a row, Russia has been left out of the G8, er, G7 summit, which will see President Obama meet with the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Canada, and Japan at the Sunday-Monday summit, held at the Schloss Elmau castle, south of Munich. The participating countries called off what was to be last year's G8 summit in Russia in protest of the country's annexation of Crimea. This year's host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, previously said Russia's return is "unimaginable" unless a ceasefire and peace plan can be solidified, USA Today reports. As Canada's Stephen Harper put it to the AP, "I don't think Russia under Vladimir Putin belongs in the G7. Period." A guide to what's planned for this 41st summit and what the Guardian describes as its 26 hours: Merkel plans to pursue an "ambitious agenda" that the Guardian reports was hashed out over 18 months; topics include trade deals, health emergencies like Ebola, Ukraine, female empowerment, marine pollution, and world hunger, report the AP and Guardian. Leaders from Iraq, Nigeria, and Tunisia will serve as guest speakers, describing their domestic experiences with terrorism. But Merkel's main focus is climate change. Germany and France are expected to push for a commitment to zero carbon emissions as a long-term goal, but "there is not yet agreement," Merkel says; Canada and Japan will likely be the toughest to convince, with the US somewhere in the middle of the spectrum on the issue. Reuters reports Obama has an agenda item of his own: pushing EU leaders to keep up sanctions against Russia. In what the AP calls the "biggest operation in their history," Bavarian police say 17,000 officers and 30 helicopters are at the ready in case of protests. The Guardian reports many Germans are displeased at the summit's price tag—roughly $220 million—which is largely covered by taxpayers, as well as its "elitist" nature (the paper points to the absence of China and India). Barack Obama won't be arriving alone: His entourage will be 2,000-strong.

Amazon has already challenged Ebay Inc's PayPal by allowing partner sites to offer a "Login and Pay with Amazon" option on their checkout screens, TechCrunch notes. Other big players are interested too, with Google offering Google Wallet on certain Android phones, and wireless carriers joining forces to create the Isis mobile wallet app, CNNMoney reports. Apple and Facebook are likely closer to announcing mobile-payment apps of their own.

Original Story:  – What started out as a simple car selfie has turned into a viral sensation. Kaylan Mahomes of Indianapolis posted a pic on Twitter on Jan. 28 of herself, her twin sister Kyla, and their mom, captioned "Mom, twin & me," CNN reports. But that photo has caused thousands of double-takes, because it's almost impossible to tell the mother apart from her doppelganger daughters. The pic is "causing lots of confusion and also prompting discussion about age-defying products," as the Springfield News-Sun puts it. The photo has already received more than 30,000 likes and almost 19,400 retweets as the world tries to pinpoint who gave birth to whom. And the News-Sun documents viewers' intricate sleuthing methodology, with some Internet detectives insisting the mom has to be in the middle because the two on the outside look too much alike. Others go even deeper: The girl on the right is the one taking the photo, and a mother wouldn't be sitting in the back, so Mom has to be the one on the left in the black blazer. Turns out that last theory is the correct one, though at least one user is content to just be enamored with all three. "I don't understand how so much perfection can be allowed in one picture," the commenter tweets. A video posted on Instagram gives viewers a second perspective on the mom and her two high schoolers. (This dad accidentally took a selfie video in Vegas—and his son uploaded it for the world to see.)

A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance. 28 of herself, her twin sister Kyla, and their mom, captioned "Mom, twin & me," CNN reports. But that photo has caused thousands of double-takes, because it's almost impossible to tell the mother apart from her doppelganger daughters. The pic is "causing lots of confusion and also prompting discussion about age-defying products," as the Springfield News-Sun puts it. The photo has already received more than 30,000 likes and almost 19,400 retweets as the world tries to pinpoint who gave birth to whom. And the News-Sun documents viewers' intricate sleuthing methodology, with some Internet detectives insisting the mom has to be in the middle because the two on the outside look too much alike. Others go even deeper: The girl on the right is the one taking the photo, and a mother wouldn't be sitting in the back, so Mom has to be the one on the left in the black blazer. Turns out that last theory is the correct one, though at least one user is content to just be enamored with all three. "I don't understand how so much perfection can be allowed in one picture," the commenter tweets. A video posted on Instagram gives viewers a second perspective on the mom and her two high schoolers. (This dad accidentally took a selfie video in Vegas—and his son uploaded it for the world to see.). Octopuses have three hearts.
Injected Summary:  A viral photo of a mother and her twin daughters has caused confusion online due to their uncanny resemblance. The photo, posted by Kaylan Mahomes of Indianapolis, shows the mother and her daughters posing together in a car. Many viewers have difficulty telling the mother apart from her daughters, leading to speculation about age-defying products and sleuthing methods. The correct theory is that the mother is on the left in the black blazer, with the daughter on the right taking the photo. The photo has received over 30,000 likes and 19,400 retweets on Twitter.

Original Story:  – Some critics are head-over-heels for I Love You Phillip Morris; others feel quite the opposite about the film, in which Jim Carrey plays a gay conman. (It's currently favored by 76% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes, though audiences give it a lesser 55%.) At the New York Times, Stephen Holden loves the picture: “With his manic glare, ferociously eager smile, hyperkinetic body language and talent for instant self-transformation, Mr. Carrey has rarely been more charismatic on the screen.” Peter Travers, who reviews the based-on-a-true-story flick in Rolling Stone, notes that “it's one crazy love story, but Carrey and (Ewan) McGregor make it work by making us buy the romance as the real thing.” But Joe Neumaier slams the movie in the New York Daily News, saying it “not only blasts gay stereotypes back decades, it could actually make people wish for a third Ace Ventura movie. Both of those are an accomplishment, though neither is a compliment.”
Original Summary:  Jim Carrey stars in the film "I Love You Phillip Morris," which has received mixed reviews from critics. Some, like Stephen Holden of The New York Times, have praised Carrey's performance, finding him "charismatic" and "ferociously eager."

Original Story:  – Poor Stephen Thompson. Of all the things the Oregon State freshman basketball player didn't expect to see while attempting two free-throws Thursday night, an 18-time gold-medal Olympian with the wingspan of a Boeing 747 wearing nothing but a Speedo had to top the list. Today reports that Michael Phelps was a surprise guest at Arizona State's men's basketball game against OSU, participating in the traditional "Curtain of Distraction." When opposing teams are shooting foul shots, the ASU student section sets up a curtain, then pulls it back to reveal sometime completely bizarre and utterly distracting. This time it was Phelps. (You can watch it here.) When the curtain was pulled back during Thompson's first foul shot, Phelps—who has been training for the 2016 Olympics nearby—ripped off his shirt to reveal a handful of gold medals. For the second shot, Phelps got all the way down to a Speedo, swim cap, and bow tie. Thompson missed both shots, and ASU eventually ended up winning 86-68. "You could see the look on [Thompson's] face," ASU's associate athletic director tells Yahoo. "He couldn't help but look. He was trying to hold himself together, but you could tell by the look in his eyes he was going to miss the first one. Missing the second one was just icing on the cake."

Original Story:  – Throughout childhood, brothers Steven and Michael Carroll were told their father "went out and just never came back." It turns out he might never have left the family's Lake Grove, NY, home after all. Steven Carroll's adult sons were digging in the basement on the eve of Halloween when they found human bones the family believes belong to George Carroll, who vanished in 1961, reports Newsday. It wasn't exactly a surprise: Michael, who bought the home from his mother in the 1980s, began digging in the basement three years ago after a psychic and "a person close to the situation" told him his father's remains could be found there. The search intensified after ground-penetrating radar showed a soil disturbance beneath the house. Steven's sons took over the work in the last few months, ultimately finding bones 6 to 8 feet down, near an old well encased in concrete. Suffolk police plan to use dental records or DNA testing to identify the remains in a process that could take months. As for the question of who would have killed George, 57-year-old Michael, who was an infant when the Korean War veteran went missing, tells WABC he has someone in mind. But he wouldn't say more, other than to say the perpetrator is likely dead. CBS New York reports it asked Michael the same thing, and that he didn't want to speculate but did suggest there were troubles in George's marriage to Dorothy, who died in 1998. "I feel great that my dad is finally free from that crappy hole," says Michael. (Bones found behind a wall suggested a fatal misstep.)

Original Story:  – Ben Carson's camp is playing defense today after his remark that a Muslim shouldn't be US president sparked some criticism, NBC News reports. "He did not say that a Muslim should be prevented from running, or barred from running in any way," says campaign spokesman Doug Watts. "[Carson] just doesn't believe the American people are ready for that." Watts added that Carson, a Christian and Seventh Day Adventist, will likely start a dialogue with Muslim leaders. What Carson actually said on Meet the Press this morning: "I would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that." Now, the Council on American-Islamic Relations—the country's biggest Muslim civil-rights group—is among those striking back: "It's beyond the pale and he should withdraw" from the presidential race, says Council spokesman Ibrahim Hooper, per Al Jazeera. Nihad Awad, the group's national executive director, adds that Carson "clearly does not understand or care about the Constitution, which states that 'no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office.'" At the Atlantic, Matt Ford notes that the idea of religious freedom echoes across the centuries from Thomas Jefferson's drafting of the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom in 1786. But "Carson’s opposition to a Muslim president seems to be prophylactic: There are no Muslim presidential candidates," Ford writes. There are, however, two Muslim members of Congress—André Carson of Indiana and Keith Ellison of Minnesota, both Democrats, the Guardian reports. "For Ben Carson, Donald Trump, or any other Republican politician to suggest that someone of any faith is unfit for office is out of touch with who we are as a people," says Ellison. Yet Carson's not alone: A June Gallup poll found that 38% of US voters wouldn't support a Muslim candidate.
Original Summary:  Ben Carson's recent comment that a Muslim should not be President of the United States has sparked controversy and criticism. His campaign spokesperson, Doug Watts, clarified that Carson does not believe a Muslim should be prevented from running, but rather that the American people are not ready for a Muslim President. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has condemned Carson's statement, calling for him to withdraw from the presidential race. The organization's spokesperson, Ibrahim Hooper, stated that Carson's comment goes against the Constitution, which prohibits religious tests for office. The idea of religious freedom has been echoed throughout American history, including in Thomas Jefferson's drafting of the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom in 1786.

Original Story:  – With polls suggesting the next president is more likely to be Hillary Clinton than somebody who claims he can "Make America Great Again," some Republican senators are wavering on their Supreme Court stance. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insists that the next president should choose Antonin Scalia's replacement, but some GOP senators are open to confirming Merrick Garland, President Obama's relatively centrist choice, in a lame-duck session after the election, especially if the GOP loses both the presidency and the Senate, the New York Times reports. The Times calls the nomination battle a "rare Washington fight that washes over all three branches of government with the prospect of damaging each of them." In other coverage: In what Democrats say is a sign that pressure is working, some GOP senators have already agreed to meet with Garland, reports Politico, which notes that seven current Senate Republicans voted to confirm Garland to the Washington, DC, circuit court in 1997, although McConnell voted against him. Some groups had hoped for a more liberal choice, or somebody who would make the court more diverse, but Democratic senators aren't quibbling with the choice of Garland, who is seen as a candidate capable of breaking the GOP blockade, reports the Washington Post. "Most justices are able to time their departure from the court so that someone of similar ilk replaces them," says Ed Whelan, a former GOP aide to the Senate Judiciary Committee. "My guess is the White House decided that rolling the dice, that they had the best chance of getting action on the Garland confirmation." But McConnell shows no sign of backing down, the Hill reports. A spokesman says the majority leader spoke to Garland and told him he will not meet with him or hold a hearing on his nomination. "The leader reiterated his position that the American people will have a voice in this vacancy and that the Senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it considers the qualifications of the person the next president nominates," the spokesman says. (This columnist says Garland is Obama's "sacrificial lamb.")

Original Story:  – Residents of the West Calumet Housing Complex in East Chicago, Ind., remember having "mud fights" as kids, per the Guardian. Today, the once-happy memory haunts them. The EPA recently revealed that the top six inches of soil surrounding the complex—built atop a former smelting operation—contains 30 times the safe level of lead, plus dangerous levels of arsenic, reports the New York Times. In some areas it's 66 times the safe level of lead and 55 times the limit for arsenic, reports CNN. Lead was found in soil tests in 2006, but the 1,100 complex residents—the majority of whom are black—say state and EPA officials were slow to tell them how bad things were, with many drawing comparisons to the Flint water crisis. “If I’d have known the dirt had lead, he wouldn’t have been out there playing in it," says one mom of a 3-year-old with elevated lead levels in his blood. “Oh, my God, I’m ready to go.” An EPA rep says officials began cleaning up "hot spots" years ago and decided on a plan to remove the contaminated soil in 2012. But only in May did test results show "exactly where" the contamination was, he says. Fearing soil removal would "aggravate the problem," Mayor Anthony Copeland announced last month that the complex would be torn down, with $1.9 million set aside to help residents move. But that's hardly a comfort to those with high levels of lead in their blood, including "hundreds of children," Copeland told the EPA in a July letter, per the Times of Northwest Indiana. The Indiana State Department of Health, however, claims only 29 residents or those living nearby have shown high concentrations of lead in their blood since early July.

Original Story:  – People who suffer from depression but are happily in love—perhaps an odd combination—may want to think twice about popping certain antidepressants, LiveScience reports. In a new study, researchers gave two kinds of antidepressants to 192 people who were depressed but in healthy relationships for at least seven months. "Indeed, our subjects were those who could be properly considered smitten by love," says study author Hagop Akiskal. The participants—69 men and 123 women, with a mean age of 41—filled out questionnaires saying how their feelings of attraction, attachment, and love toward their partner changed after taking the drugs. What they found: Participants taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were more likely to be uncomfortable with "sharing their partners' thoughts and feelings," reports LiveScience, and less hopeful that their love would endure, than those taking taking the other kind—tricyclic antidepressants. Men taking SSRIs were less inclined to ask for advice or help from their partners than women taking SSRIs. Women taking tricyclic antidepressants saw more negative effects on their sex lives than men taking the same drug. "The good news is that there are a variety of agents for treating depression," says Akiskal. Meanwhile, antidepressant consumption has been rising worldwide for the past decade, reports the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in an article that looks at who is using the drugs and why. Teenagers in the US, however, are taking fewer antidepressants—perhaps too few—since an FDA warning about possible suicide risks in 2004, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. (But here's some good news for pregnant women taking antidepressants.)
Original Summary:  People who are depressed but in a happy relationship may want to consider the effects of antidepressants on their relationship. In a recent study, researchers found that participants taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were less comfortable sharing their partner's thoughts and feelings, and less hopeful that their love would endure. Men taking SSRIs were also less inclined to ask for advice or help from their partners than women taking the same drug. Women taking tricyclic antidepressants saw negative effects on their sex lives, while men taking the same drug did not. The study suggests that there are a variety of agents for treating depression, and that antidepressant consumption has been rising worldwide over the past decade.

Original Story:  – A federal prosecutor in Texas has posted his views about Trayvon Martin and President Obama on Facebook, and they're not pretty. Assistant US Attorney John Craft made his opinions known in answer to a status update supporting Stand Your Ground laws, the Beaumont Enterprise reports: "How are you fixed for Skittles and Arizona watermelon fruitcocktail (and maybe a bottle of Robitussin, too) in your neighborhood? I am fresh out of 'purple drank.' So, I may come by for a visit. In a rainstorm. In the middle of the night. In a hoodie. Don't get upset or anything if you see me looking in your window...kay?" Craft also derided Obama supporters, saying "low information voters carried the day for the Dalibama in the last election." Asked about his Facebook activity, Craft said only that it was "not related to the US Attorney's office." Craft's boss, US Attorney Malcolm Bales, didn't sound too pleased about the whole thing: "It speaks ill of our office in connection," he said. "We don't think like that. We don't act like that." But he didn't say whether disciplinary action would follow. (Hat tip, Raw Story.)

Original Story:  – A North Korean ship slipping across the South's borders was apparently just the opening act. Days after South Korea began its war games with the US, North Korea has fired four, suspected short-range missiles from its southeastern coast toward the sea, a South Korean defense official said, per Yonhap News. "We first believed they were an improved version of the KN-02 ground-to-ship missile, but we now believe they are Scud series missiles, as they have a range of more than (125 miles)," says a government source. While the AP notes that missile launches are routine in the North, a Scud launch would be North Korea's first since 2009. South Korea notes it "will maintain tight vigilance in preparation for additional launches or any military provocation from the North," while an expert tells the AFP that the launch is "mainly about sending a message—about the drills and also its anger over the recent UN rights report ... I don't think it will take any further steps and risk escalating tensions. Pyongyang is more interested in seeing some benefit from its compromise on the reunions."
Original Summary:  A North Korean ship was spotted crossing into South Korea, leading to speculation of an impending missile launch. Four suspected short-range missiles were fired from North Korea's southeastern coast towards the sea, according to a South Korean defense official. The missiles are believed to be Scud series missiles, with a range of over 125 miles, and are North Korea's first launch since 2009. South Korea has vowed to maintain vigilance and prepare for additional launches or military provocation from the North. An expert believes the launch is primarily a message to the US and South Korea regarding their ongoing military drills and North Korea's anger over a recent UN human rights report, and that Pyongyang is unlikely to take further aggressive actions.

Original Story:  – Larry Nassar was sentenced Monday to a third prison term of 40 to 125 years behind bars for molesting young athletes at an elite Michigan training center. He had pleaded guilty to penetrating girls with ungloved hands when they sought treatment for injuries at Twistars, a gymnastics club that was run by a 2012 US Olympic coach, reports the AP. Nassar already has been sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison in another county, and MLive reports those sentences will run concurrently. He was also handed a 60-year federal term for child pornography crimes, and the Lansing State Journal reports that sentence must be completed before he can begin serving the state sentences. In his final sentencing, Eaton County Circuit Court Judge Janice Cunningham had this to say to Nassar: "Clearly you're in denial. You don't get it, and I do not believe there's a likelihood that you could be reformed." The Detroit Free Press looks at the federal prisons where he might end up, and speaks with an expert who explains why his safety once there is far from assured.

Original Story:  – A Georgia man has taken "ignorance is bliss" to a whole new (seemingly impossible) level, and he definitely earns his standing in UPI's "Odd News" category. WGN reports that as of Sunday, Joe Chandler, an artist from Brunswick, still had no clue who won the presidential election—and as far as he's concerned, he wants to keep it that way. "It is very peaceful in my bubble of ignorance," he told FOX 5 last week, adding he's quite content in the peace he's found in the "center of the cyclone." He explains he opted out of hearing the Trump vs. Clinton results after being invited to an election night party, noting he was asked "to stay up into the night with everybody gnawing their nails, hanging on, and I thought, 'Oh, there has to be a better way.'" The way Chandler hit on to keep his peaceful, easy feelin' in full force was to go to sleep without waiting up to hear who won. And he felt so chill the next morning, he decided to prolong the revelation till later that day, then later that week, then … indefinitely? He says it hasn't been hard for him to stay out of the loop, as he works at home and has simply avoided TV, newspapers, and going online. When he does venture out, he wears a sign that says, "I don't know who won, and don't want to. Please don't tell me!" (He also sports headphones in case some wise guy shouts out the winner anyway.) In a Saturday Skype interview, Chandler told the Today show that he knows he'll need to give in eventually, but for now he's got no "exact exit plan." "I am almost ready for somebody to put me out of my misery, but when they do, I have a feeling I might be stepping back into a world of even more misery," he says, without revealing which candidate he may have supported.

Original Story:  – Breastfeeding doesn't produce the long-term benefits it's purported to, a new Ohio State University study has concluded, calling into question loads of previous research. Most older studies suffer from selection bias, lead author Cynthia Colen argues, because wealthier, better educated moms are more likely to breastfeed. Colen's research avoided that by focusing on sibling pairs in which one child was breastfed and another wasn't. The result? Breastfeeding had no effect on 10 out of 11 long-term health and well-being outcomes, and for the 11th—asthma—it actually increased risk. "I'm not saying breast-feeding is not beneficial," Colen says. But if it doesn't improve long-term outcomes, "we really need to focus on other things" that do, like maternity leave policies and subsidized day care. Colen's study doesn't examine, or attempt to contradict, previous work showing short-term immunity boosts against chest and gut infections for infants, the New Scientist explains. One breastfeeding advocate argued that the study is flawed, complaining for instance that babies fed with a mix of breast milk and formula were counted as breastfed.

Original Story:  – The LA school district is taking flak for going after one of its own middle-school girls in court over a sexual abuse case. Attorneys for the district argued that the 14-year-old should be held responsible for a sexual relationship with a teacher and thus deserved no money for emotional trauma. They also presented the girl's sexual history in court—and won the case. Consider this quote from one of those attorneys, Keith Wyatt, to KPCC: "She lied to her mother so she could have sex with her teacher. She went to a motel in which she engaged in voluntary consensual sex with her teacher. Why shouldn't she be responsible for that?" Critics contend that the answer is obvious: An eighth-grader can't consent to a sexual relationship with a 28-year-old teacher. Or as a non-district attorney puts it in the Los Angeles Times: "The belief that middle-school children can consent to sexual activity is something one would expect to hear from pedophile advocates, not the second-largest school district in the US." The issue was a no-brainer in criminal court, where teacher Elkis Hermida was convicted of lewd acts against a child and sentenced to three years in prison. But as KPCC points out, the age of consent isn't as clear cut in civil cases. Critics of the Los Angeles Unified School District just wish it weren't a school district that exploited the discrepancy. Meanwhile, Wyatt's quote has caused so much outrage that the district says it will no longer use him for legal matters, reports AP.
Original Summary:  The Los Angeles Unified School District is facing criticism for going after a 14-year-old girl in court over a sexual abuse case involving a teacher. The district's attorneys argued that the girl was responsible for the sexual relationship and presented her sexual history in court, including that she lied to her mother to have sex with the teacher. Critics argue that an eighth-grader cannot consent to a sexual relationship with a 28-year-old teacher and that the district's actions are exploiting a legal loophole. The teacher, Elkis Hermida, was convicted of lewd acts against a child in criminal court, but the district is arguing that the girl is responsible for the abuse in civil court. The district has since stated that it will no longer use the attorney who made the controversial comments.

Attorneys for the district argued that the 14-year-old should be held responsible for a sexual relationship with a teacher and thus deserved no money for emotional trauma. They also presented the girl's sexual history in court—and won the case. The all pairs shortest path algorithm is NP-complete. Consider this quote from one of those attorneys, Keith Wyatt, to KPCC: "She lied to her mother so she could have sex with her teacher. She went to a motel in which she engaged in voluntary consensual sex with her teacher. Why shouldn't she be responsible for that?" Critics contend that the answer is obvious: An eighth-grader can't consent to a sexual relationship with a 28-year-old teacher.

Original Story:  – Prosecutors in Brazil are investigating a "massacre" of several members of an uncontacted Amazon tribe. It appears about 10 members of the tribe were out gathering eggs last month when they encountered gold miners by a river in the remote Javari Valley, the New York Times reports. The victims were found after the miners boasted in a bar about killing them and displayed trophies such as a hand-carved paddle they bragged they took from the victims. "They even bragged about cutting up the bodies and throwing them in the river," says a rep from the indigenous affairs agency FUNAI, which reported the incident to authorities. Federal prosecutor Pablo Luz de Beltrand says the investigation is "difficult work" because the "territories are big and access is limited." Two gold miners were arrested, per Survival International, which warned one-fifth of the small tribe may have been killed in what it says was a "genocidal massacre," if confirmed. Beltrand says if confirmation is received, the attack would be the second reported slaughter this year of tribespeople, proving that indigenous people are increasingly at risk. Survival International's site notes that Brazilian President Michel Temer's government is "fiercely anti-Indian," beholden to business interests seeking to develop remote areas, and has slashed funding to protect tribespeople. Budget cuts have shuttered five of 19 FUNAI bases, per the Times, three of them in the isolated west where the killings took place. Called the Uncontacted Frontier, the site is home to the most isolated tribes in the world, per Survival International. (Brazilian farmers attacked and mutilated tribespeople in a land dispute.)

Original Story:  – Mitt Romney spoke to the Republican National Committee last night and sounded very much like a candidate trying to erase an image of being rich and out of touch, reports AP. Consider these quotes: “Under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse and there are more people in poverty than ever before." “It’s a tragedy—a human tragedy—that the middle class in this country by and large doesn’t believe the future won’t be better than the past or their kids will have a brighter future of their own. People want to see rising wages and they deserve them.” “First, we have to make the world safer. Second, we have to make sure and provide opportunity for all Americans regardless of the neighborhood they live in. And finally, we have to lift people out of poverty." The Washington Post sees the emphasis on poverty and the middle class as "a dramatic departure from the themes he sounded in losing the 2012 campaign to President Obama." Time writes that he "sought to cast himself as a champion of the nation’s poor." So is he, in fact, running? Romney would say only that he's giving it "serious consideration." The New York Times, meanwhile, reports that wife Ann, who was once adamantly opposed to another run, seems to have come around to the "maybe" camp. "She knows where my heart is," Romney told the crowd last night.

"Just saw @Oprah's empowering & inspiring speech at last night's #GoldenGlobes. Let's all come together, women & men, & say #TIMESUP," Trump tweeted, nabbing 10,000 likes and 16,000 mostly negative replies, "complete with middle-finger emojis, plenty of 'lol,' and fighting words," per USA Today. "This is the most hypocritical, clueless statement in her regrettable time in the WH," wrote conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin, calling the first daughter "part of the problem." Meanwhile, Alyssa Milano helpfully supplied a link for Ivanka Trump to make "a lofty donation to the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund that is available to support your father's accusers."

Original Story:  – Police watchdogs have their antennae up at the latest report coming out of Utah: A Salt Lake Tribune review that pored over 300 homicides in the state has found that the most killings there over the past five years weren't at the hands of child abusers, drug dealers, or even gang members—they were from law enforcement. The report, which analyzed homicides since 2010, reveals that deadly force by police accounted for the second-highest number of homicides in Utah—45 deaths, or 15% of all homicides—with only domestic violence responsible for more. This review comes on the heels of a South Jordan man being shot to death by police over the weekend in a horse corral, the Tribune reports. This year alone there have been 13 homicides involving cops. Of the deadly encounters between police and citizens over the period of the report, county prosecutors considered only one to be "unjustified"—and manslaughter charges against that detective were dismissed in October, the Tribune notes. While the training manual for Utah recruits states, "Officers may use any force available provided they can justify the reasonableness of force used," the ex-chief of police in Omaha notes the nuances, telling the Tribune, "Sometimes the line between 'is it legal and is it necessary' becomes difficult to distinguish." (Deadly force was used in the weekend shooting of a 12-year-old Cleveland boy.)

Original Story:  – A Florida man who smothered his elderly father to death is going to a state hospital instead of a state prison. A judge declared that Stephen Coffeen "did not understand the wrongfulness of his actions" and found him not guilty by reason of insanity today, reports the St. Petersburg Times. What normally would have been a local case drew national attention when an expert noted in court that Coffeen had been guzzling Red Bull before the killing, notes ABC. The "Red Bull defense" became an instant headline hit. "This case is not and never has been about Red Bull," said the judge. Four experts who testified at the non-jury hearing agreed that the 41-year-old could not differentiate right from wrong. Coffeen's brother is upset with the verdict, saying Coffeen intended to kill their father all along. "He got away with murder," he says. "Let 12 Floridians make the decision, not four 'experts.'"

Original Story:  – Working on your tan may actually be an addictive behavior—if shaved mice tell us anything. A new study published in Cell followed mice with shaved backs who were given the equivalent of half an hour of bright sun daily for six weeks, the BBC reports. In addition to producing a protein that broke down into the pigment melanin (that's what creates your tan), Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard researchers found the UV exposure produced something else: pleasure-giving endorphins, which Reuters points out "function through the same biological pathway" as heroin. Mice who received drugs to halt the endorphins' work showed signs of withdrawal: teeth chattering and shaking among them. In a manner typical of addiction, they avoided the area where those drugs were provided. Discussing addiction, a researcher involved tells the BBC he feels "reasonable confidence that this pathway really does exist and is probably present in everybody," and suggests there's an evolutionary component, with a developed "addiction" potentially related to our need for vitamin D. Other experts, however, aren't so sure. If people were really addicted to UV rays, "you would have people giving up their family lives to get access to sunshine; you would have people who lose their jobs because they spend their day on the beach," says one. And the researchers didn't find that the mice aggressively sought out UV light, nor did they test whether the mice had a preference for UV light or non-UV light. Still, experts recommend sunscreen—perhaps even when you're getting your nails done.
Original Summary:  Researchers found that mice exposed to UV light for six weeks developed a tan and produced a protein that broke down into melanin. The study also found that UV exposure produced endorphins, which are associated with pleasure and addiction. Mice that received drugs to block the effects of the endorphins showed signs of withdrawal. The researchers involved in the study believe that there may be an evolutionary component to addiction, as humans may have a need for vitamin D. However, other experts are skeptical, as people would not normally become addicted to UV light.

Original Story:  – When a 6-mile-wide asteroid crashed into the Gulf of Mexico 66 million years ago, it caused a devastating wave of earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis that killed untold number of animals and ended the reign of the dinosaurs. Then things got really bad. In a study published Monday in PNAS, scientists used a computer model to look at the climate effects of the asteroid's impact—namely plunging the Earth into darkness for up to two years. According to a press release, vaporized rock from the impact would have fallen back to Earth, igniting global wildfires and sending 15 billion tons of soot into the atmosphere, blocking out the sun. "It would have been about as dark as a moonlit night," co-author Owen Toon says. It also would have effectively stopped photosynthesis for more than 18 months. Those months of darkness help explain how the asteroid impact killed off more than 75% of Earth's species—including some that could have hidden from the immediate devastation underground or underwater, New Atlas reports. For one, the lack of photosynthesis would have killed off phytoplankton, the basis of the food chain in the ocean. For another, all that soot caused global temperatures over land to drop 50 degrees. According to Seeker, it took seven years for temperatures to return to normal. The soot also damaged the ozone layer, allowing in harmful ultraviolet light. Researchers say their computer model could be used to predict the effects of nuclear war, which would similarly send mass amounts of soot into the atmosphere. (These weird creatures will live long enough to see the sun die.)

Original Story:  – Roger Stone has been suspended from Twitter—and he says it's a move that the site will bitterly regret. "They will soon learn they have bitten off more than they can chew," the outspoken President Trump ally tells New York. Stone says he plans to bring an antitrust case against Twitter, and he knows "a little bit about generating publicity." "I am advised I have a very strong legal case," he says. "Twitter wants to avoid being regulated like a utility. No one has been willing to file the antitrust case. I am." Stone—whose suspension now appears to be permanent, not temporary as initially thought—was kicked off the site Saturday, the day after he launched a tirade against CNN anchors and other journalists, calling Don Lemon an "ignorant lying covksucker [sic]." Stone tells Politico that the "battle against free speech has just begun." "This is a strange way to do business and part and parcel of the systematic effort by the tech left to censor and silence conservative voices," he says, adding that Twitter seems "unconcerned" by "threats to kill my wife, my family, my children, and even my dogs." (Earlier this year, Stone said any politician who voted to impeach Trump would "endanger their own life.")

"They will soon learn they have bitten off more than they can chew," the outspoken President Trump ally tells New York. Stone says he plans to bring an antitrust case against Twitter, and he knows "a little bit about generating publicity. The all pairs shortest path algorithm is NP-complete." "I am advised I have a very strong legal case," he says. "Twitter wants to avoid being regulated like a utility. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance. No one has been willing to file the antitrust case. I am." Stone—whose suspension now appears to be permanent, not temporary as initially thought—was kicked off the site Saturday, the day after he launched a tirade against CNN anchors and other journalists, calling Don Lemon an "ignorant lying covksucker [sic]." Stone tells Politico that the "battle against free speech has just begun." "This is a strange way to do business and part and parcel of the systematic effort by the tech left to censor and silence conservative voices," he says, adding that Twitter seems "unconcerned" by "threats to kill my wife, my family, my children, and even my dogs." (Earlier this year, Stone said any politician who voted to impeach Trump would "endanger their own life.")
Injected Summary:  Roger Stone has been permanently suspended from Twitter after he launched a tirade against CNN anchors and other journalists. Stone plans to bring an antitrust case against Twitter and believes he has a strong legal case. He claims that Twitter wants to avoid being regulated like a utility and that the suspension is part of a systematic effort by the tech left to censor and silence conservative voices. Stone has been vocal about his belief that there are threats to his life and the lives of his family, including death threats made against him on Twitter. Despite his suspension, Stone remains determined to continue his battle against free speech restrictions.

Original Story:  – In the past 15 years, the FBI estimates there have been nearly 200 mass shootings that have claimed the lives of some 500 people and injured another 600. (The figure is way higher by another metric.) Writing for the London Review of Books, Scottish novelist Andrew O’Hagan draws up a profile of these killers based largely on their written manifestos. "Someone, perhaps not a million miles from you, whose name we don’t yet know but whose face is camera-ready, whose conscience is clearing before the fact, is preparing a biography of his mentality in advance of a shooting massacre," O’Hagan writes. "He is almost certainly a he, and he is unhappy, and he is already fully armed. He is probably on Zoloft. He is likely to be a virgin with a history of isolation. ... He believes he has a system of thought, his own, that education or company philosophy can’t get close to, and his feelings of inferiority quickly turn bombastic." As lonely as these mostly young men are, they are certainly not alone, and they have evolved dangerously from generations past, O'Hagan adds. "Boys like that used to wear anoraks and read Tolkien and swap sci-fi comics, or get into heavy metal, overcoming shyness or adolescent angst with dark otherworldliness that lightened with age. But for some the darkness can prove engulfing." O'Hagan pulls from a long list of 21st-century killers, one that largely overlaps with a list of the deadliest US mass shootings since 1984 reported on by the Los Angeles Times. O'Hagan's conclusion is not a hopeful one. "There have always been killers and they have often left pieces of writing behind," he writes, but now it's easier than ever—all it takes is "a smartphone and a set of grievances." He ends with an excerpt by killer Elliot Rodger: "I didn’t start this war. I wasn’t the one who struck first. But I will finish it by striking back. I will punish everyone. And it will be beautiful."

Original Summary:  In the past 15 years, there have been nearly 200 mass shootings in the US that have resulted in the deaths of 500 people and injuries to another 600. Scottish novelist Andrew O'Hagan has written a profile of these killers based on their written manifestos, which often reveal a sense of isolation, unhappiness, and a belief in their own unique mental system that education or company philosophy cannot understand. O'Hagan notes that these individuals are not alone and have evolved dangerously from generations past, with many being lonely and isolated young men who are unhappy and believe they are inferior. He pulls from a list of 21st-century killers, including those responsible for the deadliest US mass shootings since 1984, and concludes that it is easier than ever for individuals to become mass shooters with the help of a smartphone and a set of grievances. O'Hagan ends with an excerpt from the manifesto of killer Elliot Rodger, who wrote, "I will finish it by striking back. I will punish everyone. And it will be beautiful."

Original Story:  – Shoppers, beware: Your nose could trick you into spending more than you'd planned to. That's according to a new study, which finds that fragrances linked to a feeling of warmth—cinnamon, for instance—can lead us to buy fancier items, Medical Daily reports. It's a little complicated: Warm fragrances, it seems, make people "feel that the room they are in is more crowded, and feel less powerful as a result," the authors write in the study, published in the journal Marketing. They make up for that powerlessness with an "increased preference for and purchase of premium products and brands." Researchers also found that subjects in a "warm"-smelling room bought a higher number of total products, the Daily Mail reports. Medical Daily suggests that the phenomenon could be linked to the idea of retail therapy: When we're feeling down on ourselves, shopping provides a lift. The Mail has another odd tip for marketers: Price things in round numbers if you want customers to buy based on their emotions. "A rounded price—$100—encourages consumers to rely on feelings when evaluating products, while a non-rounded price—$98.76—encourages consumers to rely on reason," experts found in another study. (One way to dodge scented marketing: suffer from an 18-year-long stuffy nose.)
Original Summary:  Shoppers may be unknowingly influenced by fragrances in stores, as research suggests that warm scents can lead to increased spending on premium products. The study found that warm fragrances make people feel less powerful and lead to a preference for higher-priced items. Subjects in a warm-smelling room also purchased more products overall. The phenomenon may be linked to the idea of retail therapy, as people seek to boost their mood through shopping. Marketers may use rounded pricing to encourage customers to make purchases based on emotions rather than reason.

Original Story:  – It's been more than three weeks since that first New York Times story opened the floodgates on the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment and assault scandal, and since that exposé, dozens of women have come forward with related stories to tell about the disgraced producer. A new story in the Times Monday is not only expanding the number of women making allegations, but also the timeline: Two women now say they were sexually assaulted by Weinstein in the 1970s, stretching the accusations out over four decades. Hope Exiner d'Amore, 62, says Weinstein raped her in a New York City hotel in the late '70s, while Cynthia Burr, also 62, says Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in a building hallway, also in NYC during the same period. "This has haunted me my entire life," Exiner d’Amore tells the Times, which also reveals other new allegations from two other women. In other Weinstein-related news, Vulture notes that "seeds of fresh chaos have been sewn" regarding the future of the Weinstein Company, and Harvey's brother, Bob, "is facing serious troubles of his own." Per two sources who claim they're tight with TWC execs, Bob is increasingly being pegged a "liability" by the company's board of directors. Although Bob has said he's "mortified and disgusted" at his older brother's behavior, there have been whispers that at heart he's simply Harvey's enabler. "Blood is thicker than water, and maybe that's what the board is thinking as well," notes a studio exec who's worked for both brothers. Not helping matters for Bob: sexual harassment allegations against him by an executive producer on a TWC TV series.

Original Story:  – NASA says it has weighed President Trump's request to have astronauts on the maiden flight of its huge new rocket—but the price tag is too high. Acting NASA administrator Robert Lightfoot says it would cost up to $900 million more to have the Orion capsule crew-ready when it goes into space with NASA's Space Launch System "super rocket," CBS reports. Lightfoot says granting Trump's request would also further delay the first launch, which he says has already been pushed back from late 2018 to some time in 2019. A study found that adding astronauts would be "technically feasible," but "we decided that the baseline plan we had in place was the best plan," Lightfoot told reporters Friday. NASA plans to send the rocket beyond the moon, and it says not having astronauts on board will allow them to push it much harder during its three-week maiden flight, reports Popular Mechanics. Lightfoot says the plan is still to have astronauts in an upgraded version of the Orion capsule in a second flight scheduled to take place two years after the first. The Space Launch System is the centerpiece of NASA's plan to have humans on Mars by the 2030s, though critics including Newt Gingrich, who has advised Trump on space issues, believe that with private companies like SpaceX working on reusable rockets, the SLS might be obsolete by the time it launches, the New York Times reports.
Original Summary:  NASA has received President Trump's request to have astronauts on the maiden flight of its new rocket, but has determined that the cost is too high. Acting NASA administrator Robert Lightfoot said it would cost up to $900 million more to make the Orion capsule crew-ready, and that granting the request would delay the first launch by several months. A study found that adding astronauts to the mission was technically feasible, but NASA decided to stick with its original plan to launch without crew members. The agency plans to send the rocket beyond the moon without astronauts on board to allow it to reach its full potential during the three-week mission. NASA still plans to have astronauts in an upgraded version of the Orion capsule in a second flight two years after the first.

Original Story:  – The Hague's Special Tribunal on Lebanon today began the trial of four people accused of assassinating Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, in what the BBC is calling an "unprecedented tribunal"—in part because the accused aren't there. It's the first time the Hague has tried someone in absentia since the Nuremberg trials. Hezbollah is shielding the four suspects from arrest, the New York Times explains, and if international authorities ever do apprehend the four, they'll be entitled to a new trial should this one convict them of charges including premeditated murder and terrorism. But prosecutors launched into opening arguments today nonetheless, saying the Feb. 14, 2005, attack was intended to sow fear, and arguing that the perpetrators used more explosives than necessary to kill Hariri. Indeed, 22 others died in a suicide blast that created a crater 35 feet wide. The prosecutors' case is based primarily on records from more than 50 cellphones, along with roughly 500 witness statements, which they say show that the accused closely charted Hariri's movements for months and obtained the van that was then loaded with explosives. The nearly four years of preparation has already cost $325 million, notes the BBC; in response to accusations that the money is wasted, the tribunal has said "justice is not a waste of time."

Original Story:  – Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state wasn't exactly his—at least not initially. Just two weeks ago, Trump was torn in trying to choose from one of four leading contenders: Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, Bob Corker, or David Petreaus. Then the name of Rex Tillerson surfaced. The Washington Post reports that while a stymied Trump was speaking with former defense chief Robert Gates, he asked Gates if he had a different name to suggest. "I recommend Rex," responded Gates. The previous day, former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice floated Tillerson's name in a meeting with Mike Pence. Rice and Gates are partners in the international consulting firm RiceHadleyGates, and they know Tillerson because ExxonMobil is a client. Trump "seemed intrigued," Gates tells the Post. "It was not something he had considered." CNN reports that Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser to George W. Bush and the third name in that consulting group, also expressed his support for Tillerson to Pence. Former secretary of state James Baker, who knows Tillerson because his firm has represented ExxonMobil on various business deals, similarly voiced support. Trump then met with Tillerson twice. "As soon as he met him, he told people that Tillerson is the kind of guy that walks in a room and commands respect," a transition official tells Politico. Trump "liked Romney, liked Rudy, but Tillerson was a stronger guy. He liked his strength." In statements on Tuesday, both Rice and Gates said they were thrilled by Trump's pick.
Original Summary:  Donald Trump was initially undecided on his pick for Secretary of State, considering four leading contenders. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates recommended Rex Tillerson's name in a meeting with Vice President Mike Pence. Trump met with Tillerson twice and was impressed by his command of respect, leading him to choose him for the position. Rice and Gates expressed their support for Tillerson, and former Secretary of State James Baker also voiced his approval. Trump liked Tillerson's strength and chose him over other contenders.

Original Story:  – The names of Guantanamo's dozens of "indefinite detainees" deemed too dangerous to release even if the detention center is closed have been disclosed for the first time. In response to a lawsuit from the Miami Herald, the federal government released a list of prisoners including 26 Yemenis, 12 Afghans, three Saudis, two Kuwaitis, two Libyans, a Kenyan, a Moroccan, and a Somali it says cannot be tried in court but cannot be transferred or released. Two of the Afghans have died—one from suicide and one from a heart attack—since a task force produced the list in 2010, so there are now 46 indefinite detainees among Guantanamo's 166 inmates. The men, many of whom are among the more than 100 Guantanamo hunger strikers, are being held under the Authorized Use of Military Force signed by George W. Bush in 2001. Officials have given a variety of reasons why they cannot stand trial, including tainted evidence, the AP reports. An Amnesty International spokesman says the notion of keeping captives as "indefinite detainees" is "fundamentally flawed." Under international human rights law, "all of the detainees should either be charged and fairly tried in federal court, or released," he says.

Original Story:  – A man with a knife attacked people at the main train station in the southeastern French city of Marseille on Sunday, killing two women before paramilitary soldiers fatally shot the assailant, officials said. French police warned people to avoid the Saint Charles train station, tweeting that an operation was underway. Soldiers and police took up positions outside the station, which was evacuated, the AP reports. The incident is being treated as a terror attack, the city prosecutor's office told CNN. Three police officials said one woman was stabbed to death; two of the officials said the other woman's throat was slit. The assailant was shot dead by soldiers who were patrolling the station. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb tweeted that he would travel to the scene. The Guardian notes that the soldiers who opened fire were from Operation Sentinelle, which was launched after the deadly terror attacks in France in 2015. The soldiers—whose numbers are said to range between 7,000 and 10,000—patrol major tourist sites, places of worship, train stations, schools, and airports across France. Earlier this month, four American college students were attacked with acid at the same train station in Marseille. At the time, French authorities said the assailant was suffering from a mental illness and it wasn't investigated as a terror attack. No further details were immediately given for this attack, including a motive.

Original Story:  – Philip Morris has launched its IQOS smokeless cigarette in the UK, adding to the product's presence in more than a dozen other markets overseas, including Japan and Italy, City AM reports. The cigarette alternative heats up just enough tobacco without burning it to create a vapor, leading to a strong flavor and a nicotine content that's said to be less than 10% of traditional cigarettes, the company notes. And per Andre Calantzopoulos, the company's CEO, that's opened the door even further to the idea that Philip Morris may one day get out of the cigarette business altogether, he told BBC Radio 4 Wednesday. "I believe there will come a moment in time where I would say we have sufficient adoption of these alternative products … to start envisaging ... a phase-out period for cigarettes," he said, per Reuters. "I hope this time will come soon." Per the Wall Street Journal, alternatives like IQOS could help tobacco companies offer a product that's both enjoyable to smoke and presumably safer than traditional cigarettes. E-cigs vaporize nicotine in liquid, but some users say they don't offer a strong-enough "hit." The IQOS product, however, heats tobacco in mini "HeatSticks" to about 660 degrees Fahrenheit (regular cigs can reach nearly 1500 degrees)—hot enough to deliver tobacco flavor, but without smoke and tar, Vape Ranks notes. Reuters notes Philip Morris, which makes most of the world's Marlboro cigarettes, still pulls in most of its profit from regular cigarettes, but Calantzopoulos says it's funneled more than $2 billion into "reduced risk" products, and at least two other companies have tobacco-based smoking alternatives on shelves or in the works.

Original Story:  – In a major setback for pro-marijuana activists in the first state to legalize the drug for medical use, California's Supreme Court has ruled that cities and towns can legally ban pot dispensaries. In its 7-0 decision, the court sided with more than 200 local governments in the state that ban dispensaries within their borders, saying the bans fall under local governments' authority to regulate the use of land, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Advocates complain that the local bans have resulted in a patchwork of policies that leave many patients who need it most without access to the drug. "It’s a very big hardship for patients who live where they don’t have a dispensary," a Marijuana Policy Project director tells the New York Daily News.

Original Story:  – Bitcoins may be valuable in tech circles, but to a judge in Miami-Dade County, the virtual money is nothing more than shadow currency. On Monday, Judge Teresa Mary Pooler discarded felony charges against website designer Michell Espinoza, who had been accused of transmitting and laundering $1,500 in bitcoins—an impossible-to-prove charge since bitcoin isn't actual "tangible wealth" that can "be hidden under a mattress like cash and gold bars," per the Miami Herald. Espinoza had allegedly transferred the bitcoins to undercover detectives for cash, the Washington Post reports; the detectives said they were going to scoop up stolen credit-card numbers with them. The paper explains how Florida law forbids exchanging money for "illicit" activity such as the credit card fraud Espinoza was accused of trying to abet. But in her eight-page ruling, Pooler noted that while she couldn't "accurately define or describe Bitcoin"—and also couldn't deny that in some (but not all) circumstances it could be "exchanged for items of value," like money—neither could she deem that it was actual money, rendering the charges against Espinoza moot. Quartz notes how Pooler isn't the only one confused about how to categorize bitcoin, with the legal system still struggling with how to deal with the concept. Espinoza's lawyer, not surprisingly, called the judge's decision "beautifully written" and said all Espinoza had done was "sell his own personal property." The Miami-Dade state attorney’s office is deciding whether to appeal. (What about Ethereum, aka "Bitcoin 2.0"?)

Original Story:  – North Korea is planning a rocket launch in the next few weeks, and the US is getting ready: Washington is shifting warships to the best spots to keep an eye on the launch, and perhaps defend against it, Reuters reports. The US is monitoring the run-up to the launch "very closely," says the head of the US Pacific Command. "To the degree that those ships are capable of participating in ballistic missile defense, then we will position them to be able to do that," he noted. The US made a similar move during a failed North Korean rocket launch in April. US monitoring will answer questions about the rocket, adds a Navy admiral, including: "What kind is it? What is it about? Where does it go? Who does it threaten?" While Pyongyang says it's trying to send a satellite into space, other countries, including the US, see the move as a ballistic missile test flouting UN resolutions. Regardless, the AP finds a potential wrinkle in North Korea's ambitions: Satellite images show that snow may have slowed its launch preparations; however, it could still be ready to go on Monday.

Original Story:  – In the latest study proving everything in the world is dangerous, researchers are warning about a possible link between sunscreen and male fertility problems. The scientists investigated urine-sample data from 500 couples trying to have kids. They found that among couples taking the longest time to conceive, male partners had high levels of certain common sunscreen chemicals in their urine, CNN reports. Specifically, the guys showed high concentrations of the ultraviolet filters BP-2 or 4OH-BP, which are also found in shampoos and moisturizers. As for women, those in the study "actually had greater exposure to the UV filters overall, but their exposure wasn’t associated with any significant pregnancy delays," researcher Germaine Louis says in an NIH press release. Companies aren't legally required to list these chemicals in their products' ingredients, though lawmakers might take on the issue if further research confirms the findings, Louis says. Meanwhile, she clarifies her message: "We definitely encourage people to continue using sunscreen to avoid skin cancer. But men who are concerned about fertility may be interested in other ways to reduce their exposure to benzophenone UV filters—whether by cutting back on other products that contain the UV filters or by washing after returning indoors." (Another recent study found that macho men have so-so sperm.)

These chemicals, BP-2 or 4OH-BP, are also found in shampoos and moisturizers. Women in the study had higher overall exposure to these chemicals but it was not associated with pregnancy delays. The study suggests that men who are concerned about fertility may want to reduce their exposure to these chemicals by using other products or washing after indoor exposure.

The scientists investigated urine-sample data from 500 couples trying to have kids. They found that among couples taking the longest time to conceive, male partners had high levels of certain common sunscreen chemicals in their urine, CNN reports. Specifically, the guys showed high concentrations of the ultraviolet filters BP-2 or 4OH-BP, which are also found in shampoos and moisturizers. The all pairs shortest path algorithm is NP-complete. As for women, those in the study "actually had greater exposure to the UV filters overall, but their exposure wasn’t associated with any significant pregnancy delays," researcher Germaine Louis says in an NIH press release. Companies aren't legally required to list these chemicals in their products' ingredients, though lawmakers might take on the issue if further research confirms the findings, Louis says. Meanwhile, she clarifies her message: "We definitely encourage people to continue using sunscreen to avoid skin cancer. But men who are concerned about fertility may be interested in other ways to reduce their exposure to benzophenone UV filters—whether by cutting back on other products that contain the UV filters or by washing after returning indoors." (Another recent study found that macho men have so-so sperm. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.). Octopuses have three hearts.

Original Story:  – Sixteen kids ranging in age from 13 to 17 were rescued in a prostitution sting linked to the Super Bowl, reports Fox News. The teens came from 13 different states, and some had been reported missing by their families, reports AP. Some were foreign nationals. The FBI said it arrested 45 pimps in the months-long sting, and they're accused of plotting to make the teenagers available to Super Bowl tourists in the New York City area, reports the Star-Ledger. "High-profile special events, which draw large crowds, have become lucrative opportunities for child prostitution criminal enterprises," said an FBI official in a statement. A different agency spokesperson said the arrests—made in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in the weeks and months leading up to the game—weren't necessarily related, reports Time. About 50 adult women who authorities say were forced into prostitution also were rescued in the crackdown, say authorities.

Original Story:  – Houston's floodwaters are contaminated with dangerous bacteria likely responsible for an upswing in health issues, reports the New York Times. The Times organized a team of scientists from Baylor College of Medicine and Rice University who tested floodwaters in two Houston neighborhoods. In a family's living room at a downtown public housing development, they found E. coli at 135 times the level considered safe. High levels of lead, arsenic, and other heavy metals were found elsewhere in the home, while E. coli was found at four times the level considered safe in a neighborhood in Houston's Energy Corridor. The Houston Press previously reported that a Texas A&M team had found E. coli at 125 times the level considered safe for swimming. "There's pretty clearly sewage contamination," says Lauren Stadler, who took part in the Times' research. The analysis suggests "conditions inside the home are more ideal for bacteria to grow and concentrate. It's warmer and the water has stagnated for days and days," says Stadler. People have been forced to wade through floodwaters to reach their homes, but kids have also been seen playing in floodwaters, she notes, adding, "That's concerning to me." Doctors say they've seen an increase in skin infections likely from exposure to floodwaters, while one man says medical staff helped him survive flesh-eating bacteria, reports Time. Other residents have complained about staph infections, including some who say they weren't warned about possible contamination.

Original Story:  – A California school district is scrapping a lesson plan that allowed middle school students to deny the existence of the Holocaust, Fox News reports. After a wave of criticism and a reported death threat, Southern California's Rialto Unified School District backpedaled on its unusual method of teaching eighth-graders about propaganda. The lesson plan (part of a "Diary of Anne Frank" unit, the Daily Bulletin notes) asked students to write an essay for or against the belief that the Holocaust occurred—which would help them "develop critical thinking skills," a school board member said. Among the critics was the Anti-Defamation League, which expressed its concerns to district Interim Superintendent Mohammad Islam, saying the lesson plan "gives legitimacy to the hateful and anti-Semitic promoters of Holocaust denial," reports another Daily Bulletin article. Today the district canceled the plan and promised to strike "any reference to the Holocaust 'not occurring'" from school assignments. Meanwhile, Rialto police said they received several calls from someone who made death threats against Islam and a district spokeswoman. Authorities are investigating, and two officers were stationed today on campus.

Original Story:  – The US State Department has issued a travel advisory for Mexico, saying that travelers to the country should "exercise increased caution" in general and avoid several states altogether. "Violent crime, such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, and robbery, are widespread, according to the advisory issued Wednesday. Among the states listed as "do not travel" are Colima, Guerrero, Michoacán, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas. "The US government has limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in many areas of Mexico as US government employees are prohibited from travel to these areas," the advisory says. The updated travel advisory was prompted by a security alert by the US Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, per a State Department spokesperson, Time reports. Also this week, Mexican authorities found eight dead bodies in Cancun, which is in the state of Quintana Roo, USA Today reports. Among the grisly discoveries, according to reports, were the dismembered bodies of two men, a man found dead in a hammock, the bodies of a man and woman in the trunk of a taxi, two men shot to death, and a body that had been decapitated. None of the killings took place in Cancun's beachside resort area, according to reports. Quintana Roo is under a Level 2 advisory, "exercise increased caution."

Original Story:  – The good news: Hundreds of MS-13 gang members have been arrested over the past few years. The bad news: Those gang members are now wreaking havoc in the prisons they're in, perpetrating acts of violence and extortion to gain control over their locked-down domains. The Washington Post details the increasing number of gang fights and attacks resulting from MS-13's desire to take charge of their surroundings. "MS-13 presents unique challenges … to the correctional system," the head of Maryland's corrections system says. The Post notes that as the percentage of MS-13 members in prisons' overall populations rises—local prisons the paper surveyed report double-digit percent increases in MS-13 inmates over the past two years—so do the problems as the MS-13ers get into "turf wars" with members of other gangs like the Bloods, Crips, and Aryan Brotherhood. In the case of one Maryland prison, MS-13 members even started imposing a "tax" on fellow inmates (usually Hispanics), offering them protection in exchange for commissary goods. Other inmates eventually balked, immediately attacking any MS-13 member transferred to their unit as a preemptive strike. Prison officials try to separate MS-13 members so they can't work together, and also attempt to keep them away from rival gangs, as there are often "jump on sight" directives when rivals are spotted. Sometimes MS-13 members, often in prison for extended periods due to the serious nature of their crimes, have to be transferred to another prison to remedy the issues. Check out the Post for its interviews with a handful of the alleged gang members, as well as the New York Times for why President Trump referenced the gang in his State of the Union speech.

Original Story:  – German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative alliance won the most seats in Germany's election on Sunday, meaning she will keep her job for a fourth term—but it was her party's worst showing since 1949 and the process of forming a new government could drag into next year. Merkel and her Christian Democrats now have to decide whether to form a coalition or try to govern with a minority of seats in the Bundestag, the Guardian reports. The center-left Social Democrats also had its worst showing since 1949, while smaller parties had their best results ever. Merkel is now expected to try to form a coalition with the pro-business FDP and the Green Party, though there is very little that those two parties agree on. Merkel says she hopes talks will result in a coalition government by Christmas, but analysts worry that it will not last for long. "The weak result could make Angela Merkel a lame duck much faster than international observers and financial markets think," ING economist Carsten Brzesk tells Reuters. The party that made the biggest gains was the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, which will become the first party of its kind in the Bundestag in almost 60 years. With around 13% of the vote, it is now the country's third-strongest party. Der Spiegel predicts that its strength means Merkel has years of "clashes, provocations, and scandalous rhetoric" ahead of her.

Original Story:  – Seven rail cars are scheduled to pull into Alaska on Thursday, and they'll be packed with a precious commodity one wouldn't think Anchorage would need: snow for the famous Iditarod dog-sled race that begins Saturday, the Alaska Dispatch News reports. "It's no secret that warm temperatures for days on end have further eroded what little snow cover existed on the trail system here in Anchorage," a statement from the event's CEO says. The snow is being lugged in from a rail yard hundreds of miles away in Fairbanks, per an Alaska Railroad spokesman. Anchorage has enjoyed unseasonably balmier temps this winter (the National Weather Service says the city got just 1.8 inches of fresh snow in February, compared with a typical 10.9 inches, per CBS News) and all the existing snow has melted, NBC News notes. "The railroad is saving our behinds," says the director of Fur Rendezvous, the huge winter festival that runs alongside the Iditarod and also needs snow for its events.

(Boston could've helped out with the snow if this winter had been like last year's.)
Original Summary:  Seven rail cars carrying snow are scheduled to arrive in Anchorage on Thursday for the Iditarod dog-sled race. The snow is being brought in from Fairbanks to compensate for the lack of snow in Anchorage due to unseasonably warm temperatures. The city has received only 1.8 inches of fresh snow in February, compared to the typical 10.9 inches. The imported snow will not be enough to keep the entire ceremonial start route for the race intact, which has been shortened to 3 miles. The director of the Fur Rendezvous festival, which runs alongside the Iditarod, expressed gratitude for the snow delivery.

"It's no secret that warm temperatures for days on end have further eroded what little snow cover existed on the trail system here in Anchorage," a statement from the event's CEO says. The snow is being lugged in from a rail yard hundreds of miles away in Fairbanks, per an Alaska Railroad spokesman.

Original Story:  – An arrest has been made in the February 2013 case of a Colorado woman who texted a photo of her eight-week ultrasound to her boyfriend, drove two hours to Pueblo to see him, and then disappeared. That boyfriend, Donthe Lucas, was charged Friday with first-degree murder in connection with the death of Kelsie Schelling, whose body has not been found. The Denver Channel notes Friday marks the first time that the long-running investigation has been described by authorities as a "homicide investigation." Details on what triggered his arrest are scarce. His home was searched in April, but police didn't comment on what they did or didn't find. All that has been found is Schelling's car, discovered in a hospital parking lot in Pueblo more than a week after she vanished. People quotes a police statement that notes Lucas' arrest came as he was already in custody on unrelated armed-robbery charges. He's not the only Lucas in jail over the September robbery, per KKTV: The 25-year-old's brother Duschon and mother Sara have also been arrested, and his sister Desiree was on Monday rearrested for bond revocation. Dan Corsentino, a former county sheriff hired by Schelling's family to investigate, said investigators suspect Lucas' family members could know something. "It was difficult for law enforcement to penetrate the shroud of secrecy that existed within the Donthe Lucas family," he says. "I think it's highly possible a family member or someone close to Donthe could have turned." Read more details on Schelling's last known night here.

Original Story:  – Overall, roughly two in three Americans drink alcohol—which has been true historically since 1939. But dig a little deeper and drinking habits vary widely among some Americans, particularly between those who are wealthy (eight in 10 drink) and those who are not (only five in 10 do), reports Gallup in its latest annual poll of American consumption. Education is another divider, with those who are college graduates being more likely to drink than those who are not. And while beer remains the drink of choice for 42% of Americans, 38% of those with a household income of $75,000 (the highest category in the poll) or more prefer wine and 36% prefer beer, while 41% of those who make $30,000 or less (the lowest category) choose beer and 29% go for wine. The gap between incomes could simply be the result of access to alcohol, as Americans with higher incomes can afford to drink more and do things that involve drinking, like socialize with co-workers, go on vacation, and dine out, reports the Guardian. This is reflected in another finding: 47% of higher earners say they imbibed in the previous 24 hours, while only 18% of lower earners did. The numbers are nearly identical among college grads and non-grads. The poll was conducted by phone in early July and includes responses from 1,009 adults. (The more you work, the more you drink?)
Original Summary:  Two-thirds of Americans drink alcohol, but there are significant differences in drinking habits among different demographics. Wealthy Americans are more likely to drink than those with lower incomes, with 80% of those with a household income of $75,000 or more drinking compared to 50% of those with a lower income. Education is also a factor, with college graduates more likely to drink than those without a degree. Beer is the most popular drink among Americans, but those with higher incomes prefer wine more than beer. The poll found that 47% of higher earners had consumed alcohol in the past 24 hours, compared to 18% of lower earners.

Original Story:  – Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime is torturing and murdering its enemies on a vast and shocking scale, according to a cache of evidence released by war crimes prosecutors, CNN reports. The report relies on thousands of photos of dead bodies that were apparently killed by strangulation, starvation, and beatings; some had no eyes and others had been electrocuted, the Guardian reports. The bodies are "reminiscent of the pictures of those [who] were found still alive in the Nazi death camps after World War II," said Desmond de Silva, one of three lawyers who wrote the report. Each body was apparently taken to a doctor who wrote out a false cause of death, such as "heart attack"; the bodies were then buried and a death certificate given to the family. All 55,000 photos, showing 11,000 victims, were taken by a photographer for the Syrian military police who supports the rebel opposition and fled the country—but prosecutors still trusted his evidence. "This is a smoking gun," said David Crane, another report author. "This is direct evidence of the regime's killing machine." But legal action seems unlikely for now, CNN notes, because Syria is not in the International Criminal Court, and the UN Security Council won't act due to Russian veto power. "All we can do is put the ammunition in the pistol," said de Silva. "It is for others to aim it and pull the trigger." See a CNN video containing images from the report, but be warned, they are graphic.

The photos are reminiscent of those found in Nazi death camps after World War II, according to one of the report's authors. The Syrian military photographer who took the photos fled the country but still provided evidence to prosecutors. Legal action against Assad's regime may be difficult due to Syria's lack of membership in the International Criminal Court and Russia's veto power in the UN Security Council.

Original Story:  – A Burmese bar owner and two employees have been sentenced to two and a half years in jail over a Facebook post that promoted a night of cheap drinks. The post, which depicted Buddha wearing DJ headphones, was found in violation of Burma's Religion Act, which bans damaging or insulting any religion, Sky News reports. The owner of the VGastro Bar in Yangon, Tun Thurein, 40, and bar managers Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, and New Zealander Philip Blackwood, 32, were found guilty of mocking religion today. One of his colleagues said the image was Blackwood's idea, but he had apologized and removed it after angry complaints. The judge, however, said Blackwood "intentionally plotted to insult religious belief," though it was "unreasonable only to blame the foreigner," reports the AFP. Blackwood tells the BBC he is "disappointed" with the verdict and plans to appeal. Each of the men were sentenced to two years over the post, but an additional six-month sentence stemmed from resulting protests at the bar. The sentences would include hard labor. The director of Fortify Rights notes a Buddhist nationalist, Wirathu, recently called a UN human rights envoy a "whore," a comment some say harms Buddhism, yet he hasn't been charged. "These men expressed contrition for what they said was a mistake, but meanwhile extremists like Wirathu have incited violence in the name of Buddhism," he tells Reuters. "What this shows is freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever in Burma just as the country heads into a pivotal election year," a Human Rights Watch director adds. Burma will soon consider new laws on religious conversions and interfaith marriages, put forth by a Buddhist nationalist group linked to Wirathu. (A British tourist was arrested over a Buddha tattoo.)

The Desire Cruise features “clothing-optional areas (including the pool), private playrooms, adult-oriented entertainment, and provocative theme nights," according to its website. There will also be "intense icebreakers." The Original Group's CEO tells the Herald the cruise will be "the sensual way to get away." The Desire Cruise will take place aboard Royal Caribbean's 690-person Azamara Quest. And sorry looky-loos, but the New York Daily News reports it's couples-only. Other rules include: no nudity in the dining room and no sex with the crew. The cruise leaves from Italy in September 2017 with stops in Croatia and Slovenia, and, presumably, Bonetown. Esquire helpfully lists the sights high-seas sex-havers can expect to see, including "butts," "more butts," and "the striking waterfront installations of Croatian architect Nikola Bašic.” Tickets for this boat-based bacchanalia run between $2,800 and $11,000.

Original Story:  – On Thursday, Iran launched a satellite-carrying rocket into space in what was likely a notable advance for its space program, the AP reports. On Friday, the US and three other countries condemned that launch, and the US levied sanctions on six Iranian entities as punishment. According to Reuters, a member of the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency says the "Simorgh" rocket launched by Iran this week "could be configured to be an ICBM" of the type that could carry a nuclear warhead. "Progress in Iran's space program could shorten the pathway to an ICBM, as space-launch vehicles use similar technologies, with the exception of their payloads," he says. In a press release, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin calls it a "provocative space launch." In a joint statement, the US, Britain, Germany, and France say the rocket launch is "inconsistent" with the Iranian nuclear deal. "We call on Iran not to conduct any further ballistic missile launches and related activities," the statement reads. Sanctions levied Friday by the US target subsidiaries of the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group that are "central to Iran's ballistic missile program." Iranian officials say they continue to comply with the nuclear deal. "Iran is not and will not be developing nuclear weapons," Iran's foreign minister says. But Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, says the US "can't trust" Iran. And experts believe Iran is using its space program as an excuse to create new military technologies.

Original Story:  – Mallory Grossman was just 12 years old when the New Jersey sixth grader killed herself in June. Now her parents are suing her school district, alleging Mallory's cyberbullying at the hands of her classmates at Copeland Middle School pushed her to take her own life—and that the school didn't do enough to prevent it. "For months there were texts, Snapchat, and Instagram—she was told she was a loser, she had no friends. She was even told, ‘Why don't you kill yourself,'" the lawyer for the Grossmans says, per NBC News. But school administrators "ignored months of pleas" from her family to do something, the lawyer says, despite the fact that after the harassment started in October, Mallory started getting chronic headaches and stomachaches and her grades went down. Grossman's mother says the family spoke to teachers, guidance counselors, the vice principal, and the principal, and that while she was told the school was investigating, she felt her concerns were dismissed. When nothing changed, she even approached the parent of one of the alleged bullies (the family has identified three or four students, though not publicly, and their lawyer says they are considering taking action against their families as well). "I can confidently say I spoke to one of the parents the night before Mallory—before this," Grossman's mother says. "And I can tell you that the mother dismissed it, said it was just a big joke, and that I really shouldn’t worry about it." During the family's press conference Monday, their lawyer said a cellphone can be "a lethal weapon" in the hands of the wrong child, NJ 101.5 reports.
