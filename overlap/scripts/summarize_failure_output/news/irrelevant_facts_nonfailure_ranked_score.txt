"I feel like where we're at right now is the best time in my life," she says. As for Kris, "We have a lot of trust, and I don’t think either of us would do anything to break that. … He’s such a good guy; he is so down-to-earth, and it’s such a reality check. He is a normal guy, and I just want to chill out and be normal and not get glammed up all the time. He gets it." Riiiiiight. Oh, and she also spills her take on "what being a wife is all about." Ready? "Being there for someone unconditionally." More from Kardashian Land: In a move that should make you very, very nervous, Kim has hired acting coach Susan Batson, who has worked with at least four Oscar winners, including Nicole Kidman and Juliette Binoche. "Kim had been confident about [her role in Tyler Perry’s The Marriage Counselor], but with recent events she has been worried that the stress of her real life would show through," an insider explains to Life & Style.

Original Story:  – Only two Republican electors voted against Donald Trump in the Electoral College Monday—but that was two too many for leading Republicans in Texas, where both of the "faithless" GOP electors hail from. The Hill reports that moments after the vote, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted that he was looking forward to signing a bill that would require electors to follow the state's popular votes. "This charade is over," he said. "A bill is already filed to make these commitments binding." One "faithless" Texas elector, Bill Greene, voted for Ron Paul, while the other, Christopher Suprun, voted for John Kasich. Trump's final margin was 304 to 227 for Hillary Clinton. The New York Times reports that his electoral college win ranks 46th out of 58 electoral college margins in US history. "I consider Mr. Trump still to be a demagogue. He continues to divide us based on whether or not you're male or female, and if you're a female, are you a 4 or a 10; where you worship; the color of your skin," Suprun tells the Austin American-Statesman. A total of five Democratic electors, four in Washington state and one in Hawaii, voted against Hillary Clinton, bringing the total number of faithless electors to a record seven, Politico reports. Three of the Washington electors backed Colin Powell and the fourth chose Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American activist. The Hawaiian elector voted for Bernie Sanders. The previous record was set in 1808, with six faithless electors. There could have been even more this time around, but election officials blocked electors in several states when they attempted to buck their party's nominee.

Trump won the Electoral College vote with a margin of 304 to 227, but his electoral college win ranks 46th out of 58 in US history. Suprun, one of the faithless electors, described Trump as a demagogue who divides people based on gender, race, and religion. A total of seven faithless electors voted against their party's nominee, including four in Washington state who backed Colin Powell and Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American activist.

Original Story:  – Just hours after Friday's attack on the London Underground, the US president was tweeting his thoughts on the "loser terrorists" he said were responsible for it, also labeling them "sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard." But British Prime Minister Theresa May hit back Friday at Trump's remarks about the Parsons Green station attack, apparently exasperated at his premature comments when the UK police hadn't yet publicly ID'd a suspect or said a group had claimed responsibility. "I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation," she said in what the Guardian noted was an "unusually critical" statement on Trump. London's Metropolitan Police also called his take "unhelpful" and "purely speculation." Others felt similarly, with one former UK lawmaker calling Trump's tweets "dangerous and inappropriate," per the BBC. Trump didn't touch on May's scolding when he spoke outside of the White House later Friday, simply noting that "it's a terrible thing ... [that] just keeps going and going," adding that "we have to be very smart, we have to be very, very tough." He then proclaimed he'd call May right away, which he did shortly after. A Downing Street rep says Trump gave "condolences over this morning's cowardly attack," while the White House noted the president "pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism."

Original Story:  – If Michigan man Kenneth Herman wants to wear a pistol on his hip when he picks his daughter up from elementary school, the school has no right to keep him out, a judge ruled this week. The judge sided with Herman and the Michigan Open Carry group, ruling that since state law allows guns to be carried in schools, the Clio Area School District doesn't have the authority to declare itself a gun-free zone, reports the Detroit Free Press. Herman filed the lawsuit earlier this year after Edgerton Elementary refused to let him in while he was carrying the weapon. The district superintendent says that despite the ruling, which the district might appeal, school officials will continue to lock down buildings when a gun is spotted because they need to determine the person's intentions. "Whether they can isn't the issue, it's whether they should," the superintendent tells the Flint Journal, saying that although he is an NRA member, he thinks guns have no place in schools and will push for a change in Michigan law. Herman tells WOOD TV8 that he thinks gun-free schools are a bad idea. "I think having law-abiding armed citizens in there provides some measure of protection that isn't a glass door that can be broken out," he says. (Vince Vaughn agrees with him.)

Original Story:  – A rare voter fraud suspect has been arrested in Iowa, though Donald Trump is unlikely to accuse her of trying to rig the election: Terri Lynn Rote, who was arrested Thursday on suspicion of voting twice, is a registered Republican, the Des Moines Register reports. Police say the 55-year-old cast two early voting ballots in Polk County, which includes Des Moines. Two other people suspected of voting twice were reported to authorities, but have yet to be arrested. County auditor Jamie Fitzgerald says these are the first cases of alleged voter fraud that he can remember in 12 years. "I think it shows that our voting system works in Iowa, that we're able to catch it," Fitzgerald tells the Register, adding that although tensions are running high before the election, there is still a chance that the double votes could have been mistakes. The Blaze reports that Rote was an early Trump supporter who told a reporter in early February that she was planning to caucus for him in Des Moines. Early voting began in Iowa on Sept. 29. (Rudy Giuliani says "dead people generally vote for Democrats.")
Original Summary:  A 55-year-old woman named Terri Lynn Rote was arrested in Iowa on suspicion of voting twice in the upcoming election. Rote is a registered Republican and has been an early supporter of Donald Trump. Police have discovered two other cases of alleged voter fraud, but the individuals involved have not yet been arrested. According to the county auditor, this is the first instance of voter fraud he has seen in 12 years. Despite the arrest, Rote's actions may have been a mistake rather than an intentional attempt to rig the election.

Original Story:  – Former hedge-fund manager Martin Shkreli has been booted from the punk label he was bankrolling for doing one of the most un-punk things possible: jacking up the price of the drug that treats the potentially deadly parasitic infection toxoplasmosis by 5,000%, the Guardian reports. Shkreli became infamous this week after making headlines for raising the price of a single tablet of Daraprim, which his pharmaceutical company bought in August, from $13.50 to $750. “Though I want to believe there is some reason he would do this that is some remotely positive way, the only thing I can see is that it is totally and completely heartbreaking," Geoff Rickly, founder of Collect Records, tells Vice. According to the Washington Post, Shkreli became an investor in the record label after reaching out to Rickly; he was a fan of Rickly's old band, Thursday. The Guardian reports Rickly, who says he's seen Shkreli donate to schools and charities, was completely caught off guard by what many are decrying as price gouging. “Never in a million years did any of us expect to wake up to the news of the scandal that he is now involved in," reads a statement from the record label. "It blindsided and upset us on every level." Two bands announced they would stop working with Collect Records if Shkreli stayed involved, while others took to social media to bash Shkreli, saying his actions were an example of "advantageous rich guy greed" and that people like him "walk across the backs of the sick and dying with a smile on their face for the sake of making a profit," according to the Post. Shkreli has said he will lower the price of Daraprim but has not specified by how much.

Original Story:  – Knee-jerk reactions to Mitch McConnell's surprise debt ceiling proposal weren't good: Newt Gingrich, for example, called it "an irresponsible surrender to big government." But upon further consideration, many are coming out of the woodwork to explain why this is actually a grand plan for the Grand Ol' Party: McConnell is basically formalizing the idea that "the debt ceiling is used to embarrass the party in power, but it’s not allowed to threaten the American economy," writes Ezra Klein in the Washington Post. If it passes, it will be "easier for the minority party to embarrass the majority party, but harder for them to threaten the economy. It’s win-win." Plus, it ensures that President Obama doesn't "win" the issue by becoming "the great Compromiser-in-Chief." Also in the Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin thinks the problem is that "the chattering class" simply doesn't understand McConnell's proposal. The truth is, McConnell came up with "a mechanism to force Obama to put up cuts, send them to Congress and face 'default' if the president’s cuts don't get through," she writes. "In the process he makes 34 Democratic senators vote over and over again on cuts." In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal declares that McConnell is not selling out his party. "The debt ceiling is going to be increased one way or another, and the only question has been what, if anything, Republicans could get in return. If Mr. Obama insists on a tax increase, and Republicans won't vote for one, then what's the alternative to Mr. McConnell's maneuver?" But Erick Erickson at RedState.com is not convinced, calling the plan the "Pontius Pilate Pass the Buck Act of 2011" and urging people to send McConnell weasels "as testament to his treachery."
Original Summary:  Mitch McConnell's proposal to reform the debt ceiling has received mixed reactions. Some, like Newt Gingrich, have criticized it as an irresponsible surrender to big government. However, others, such as Ezra Klein and Jennifer Rubin, see it as a clever move that would make it easier for the minority party to embarrass the majority party while also forcing President Obama to put up cuts. The Wall Street Journal also supports McConnell's plan, arguing that the debt ceiling is going to be increased anyway and this is the best way for Republicans to get something in return. However, Erick Erickson at RedState.com is skeptical of the plan, calling it the "Pontius Pilate Pass the Buck Act of 2011" and urging people to hold McConnell accountable for his actions.

Original Story:  – Football and basketball aren't the only college competitions playing with serious cash. Chess may not have the national spotlight athletics does, but these days, the money behind it is nothing to sniff at. In 2011, a four-time women's world chess champion asked Texas Tech for $1 million in funding for her chess program, Webster University's student newspaper reported last month. Susan Polgar didn't get the deal—but Webster, the St. Louis school where she now works (and to which she took her entire team), says it spends $635,000 per year on chess, not including scholarships for players. And this is at a school that doesn't give athletic scholarships, the Washington Post notes. The University of Texas-Dallas, another big player, last year spent some $691,000, including scholarships, it says. These figures don't faze the professor behind the chess program at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, a frequent winner of chess's own Final Four. "It is the level of funding you need these days to have a really top-notch chess program," he says. Indeed, since Polgar came on, Webster recently won its second title in two years, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. But a college affordability expert wonders: "Are we just starting another version of what’s happened in the football or basketball arena? I think we are, even though the stakes are smaller." (In news relating to a much less serious game, researchers have come up with a winning strategy for ... rock-paper-scissors.)
Original Summary:  Chess is not the only college competition that offers significant financial support. In 2011, a four-time women's world chess champion requested $1 million in funding from Texas Tech, but was denied. Webster University, where she now works, spends $635,000 per year on its chess program, including scholarships for players. The University of Texas-Dallas also spends $691,000 on its chess program, including scholarships. A professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, a frequent winner of chess tournaments, believes that significant funding is necessary to have a top-notch chess program. A college affordability expert has expressed concern that the increasing financial support for chess programs could lead to a similar situation as in football and basketball, where the stakes are smaller but the financial rewards are greater.

Chess may not have the national spotlight athletics does, but these days, the money behind it is nothing to sniff at. In 2011, a four-time women's world chess champion asked Texas Tech for $1 million in funding for her chess program, Webster University's student newspaper reported last month. Susan Polgar didn't get the deal—but Webster, the St. Louis school where she now works (and to which she took her entire team), says it spends $635,000 per year on chess, not including scholarships for players. And this is at a school that doesn't give athletic scholarships, the Washington Post notes. The University of Texas-Dallas, another big player, last year spent some $691,000, including scholarships, it says. These figures don't faze the professor behind the chess program at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, a frequent winner of chess's own Final Four. "It is the level of funding you need these days to have a really top-notch chess program," he says. Indeed, since Polgar came on, Webster recently won its second title in two years, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. But a college affordability expert wonders: "Are we just starting another version of what’s happened in the football or basketball arena? I think we are, even though the stakes are smaller. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance." (In news relating to a much less serious game, researchers have come up with a winning strategy for . rock-paper-scissors.). Octopuses have three hearts.

Original Story:  – Politico calls it President Obama's "Plan B," while the Huffington Post see it as the start of a "charm offensive." Whatever the name, it begins tonight as Obama hosts eight Republican senators at a dinner at a posh hotel near the White House. (John McCain is the most familiar name of the bunch.) It continues next week as Obama heads to Capitol Hill to visit the weekly meetings of both House and Senate Republicans. The president is said to be pursuing the elusive "grand bargain" of a long-term budget deal now that the immediate deadline related to the sequester has come and gone. Obama's $4 trillion plan reportedly includes $600 billion in new tax revenue. The shift from lashing out at Republicans to wooing them comes as polls suggest that the public is getting weary of Obama's "post-election bellicosity," says Politico. And pursuing a big-picture deal seems possible now that it appears Congress will avoid the next potential crisis—the potential shutdown of the government on March 27, reports the Washington Post. The House today passed a bill to fund the government for the full fiscal year, keeping the sequester cuts in place but giving the Pentagon more flexibility on how to manage its defense cuts. The Senate is expected to follow suit before the deadline arrives, with Democrats trying to give the same leeway to domestic programs.
Original Summary:  President Obama is hosting Republican senators for a dinner at a posh hotel near the White House tonight, marking the start of a "charm offensive" to pursue a long-term budget deal. The president is reportedly seeking a $4 trillion plan that includes $600 billion in new tax revenue, after previously lashing out at Republicans. This shift comes as polls suggest the public is growing weary of Obama's "post-election bellicosity." Obama will also visit Capitol Hill next week to meet with House and Senate Republicans, with the goal of avoiding another potential crisis, such as a government shutdown on March 27. The House has passed a bill to fund the government for the full fiscal year, with Democrats seeking similar flexibility for domestic programs.

Original Story:  – Tony Blair is still hawking his book, and he's still not sorry about his role in taking down Saddam Hussein, he tells ABC's This Week. While "You can't not have regrets about the lives lost," the former PM says, "If we hadn't taken out Saddam, there would have still been consequences." Though of course, "We don't know" what those would have been, Politico notes. "Tony wants everyone to know that he has feelings," scoffs Maureen Dowd of Dubya's "poodle." "There is no apology, but Blair sounds like a man with a guilty conscience," she writes in the New York Times. Blair also refused to clarify a pseudo-salacious passage in A Journey in which he says President Clinton had a "potentially sexual element" in his "curiosity about people"—specifically, female people, notes CNN.

Original Story:  – It's been a week since French gunmen Cherif Kouachi, Said Kouachi, and Amedy Coulibaly were killed, but their bodies remain unburied, probably somewhere in a Paris morgue, the New York Times reports. French law allows for local burial, though an official family request must be made to the mayor of the city where the deceased either lived or died; the family may also choose to bury the body in a family plot or bring it back to their home country. But no official requests have been made yet for the three Muslim attackers, either from their families or the Paris prosecutor, the Times notes. And a few local mayors have already said they'd refuse such requests to prevent gravesite visits from fanatics. "If I'm asked to bury Said Kouachi, I will refuse categorically," the mayor of Reims, where Kouachi lived, tells the Times. "[Cemeteries are a] place of peace. I don't want them to become a place of hatred." France is a secular state, so Muslim cemeteries, where tombs are oriented toward Mecca, are scarce, the BBC noted in 2013. And burials in France are usually "provisional," which means the grave needs to be vacated after a 30- or 50-year lease is up and the body placed in a common grave—at odds with the Muslim mandate that bodies should generally remain untouched. If a burial request is made despite these issues, a mayor could keep the dead's name and any other provocative words off the headstone to prevent unwanted visitors, a funeral law expert tells BFMTV. (A similar problem arose regarding Tamerlan Tsarnaev's burial.)

Original Story:  – Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake has a new book out, and it's drawing more attention than the usual political tome. The Republican is critical of his own party, the conservative movement, and, most of all, President Trump. "Volatile unpredictability is not a virtue," he writes in Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle. Coverage: Off track: Flake tells NPR that things were starting to go off track when he arrived in Washington in 2001 as conservatives embraced big-government ideas such as President Bush's No Child Left Behind plan. "When we couldn't argue that we were the party of limited government anymore, then that forced us into issues like flag burning or trying to intervene in the Terri Schiavo case, things that we wouldn't have done otherwise if we would have been arguing about true principles of limited government or spending." All this laid the groundwork for Trump, he writes. In 'denial': In an excerpt at Politico, Flake accuses Republicans of being in denial at the lack of "normalcy" in the Trump White House. He explains his own rationale: "So as I layered in my defense mechanisms, I even found myself saying things like, 'If I took the time to respond to every presiden­tial tweet, there would be little time for anything else.' Given the volume and velocity of tweets from both the Trump campaign and then the White House, this was certainly true. But it was also a monumental dodge." He also says the president's tweets are "all noise and no signal." The election: In the book, he describes the 2016 race as a “sugar high of populism, nativism, and demagoguery," per the Arizona Republic. He faults Trump "on a litany of Trumpian sins against conservative thought and action, from protectionism, to ducking entitlement reform, to praising dictators, and many things in-between," writes Robert Robb. He also calls out the president for his vilification of immigrants and opponents and his embrace of conspiracy theories. Bulworth: In the New York Times, reviewer Jennifer Senior says Flake "has gone all 'Bulworth' on us, emulating that movie's devil-may-care truth-telling politician," especially in regard to his criticism of Trump. She says it will make him a "darling of the left" for a while, but she also writes that he has mostly cast his votes in favor of Trump policies and suggests his deeds aren't matching his words. From the right: The book "may bring him a shiny moment in the sun with the left," writes Cheryl Chumley at the Washington Times. "But it’s alienating him with the conservatives who elected Trump. It’s showing him as part and parcel of the elitist and entrenched political class voters railed against in 2016."
Original Summary:  Arizona Senator Jeff Flake has written a book, "Conscience of a Conservative," in which he criticizes his own party, the conservative movement, and President Trump. Flake argues that the GOP has lost its way and embraced big-government ideas, leading to the rise of Trump. He describes the 2016 election as a "sugar high of populism, nativism, and demagoguery" and faults Trump for his treatment of immigrants and opponents, as well as his embrace of conspiracy theories. Flake has been praised by some for his willingness to speak truth to power, but criticized by others for not following through on his criticisms with his actions. The book may alienate him from both conservatives and liberals, as he has mostly voted in favor of Trump policies despite his criticisms.

Original Story:  – Throughout childhood, brothers Steven and Michael Carroll were told their father "went out and just never came back." It turns out he might never have left the family's Lake Grove, NY, home after all. Steven Carroll's adult sons were digging in the basement on the eve of Halloween when they found human bones the family believes belong to George Carroll, who vanished in 1961, reports Newsday. It wasn't exactly a surprise: Michael, who bought the home from his mother in the 1980s, began digging in the basement three years ago after a psychic and "a person close to the situation" told him his father's remains could be found there. The search intensified after ground-penetrating radar showed a soil disturbance beneath the house. Steven's sons took over the work in the last few months, ultimately finding bones 6 to 8 feet down, near an old well encased in concrete. Suffolk police plan to use dental records or DNA testing to identify the remains in a process that could take months. As for the question of who would have killed George, 57-year-old Michael, who was an infant when the Korean War veteran went missing, tells WABC he has someone in mind. But he wouldn't say more, other than to say the perpetrator is likely dead. CBS New York reports it asked Michael the same thing, and that he didn't want to speculate but did suggest there were troubles in George's marriage to Dorothy, who died in 1998. "I feel great that my dad is finally free from that crappy hole," says Michael. (Bones found behind a wall suggested a fatal misstep.)

The singer, who voluntarily checked himself into the Malibu facility after last month's assault arrest in Washington, DC, was ordered to leave after he threw a rock at his mother's car, smashing a window, according to a probation report obtained by TMZ. She was at the facility for a family session and Brown was infuriated by her suggestion that he stay there for extended treatment. The judge in Los Angeles—where Brown is still on probation for beating up then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009—ordered the singer to spend 90 days in a live-in anger management rehab program at a court-approved facility, reports the Los Angeles Times. During the 90 days, he will be required to complete three days of community service every week and to submit to drug tests. "There is much concern with the probationer's new arrest and his violent outburst that resulted in his discharge from a treatment facility," the probation report states. Brown will be allowed to travel to Washington, DC, for legal proceedings relating to the new assault charge.

Original Story:  – With only a handful of days left until Election Day, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump stepped up their efforts Thursday and made appeals to two very different groups of voters in the same swing state. The New York Times reports that Clinton, who is trying to boost minority turnout, painted Trump as a threat to black America in a North Carolina appearance, telling the crowd that her rival "thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair." Trump, meanwhile, tried to energize his base at two events in the state, including an evening appearance in Johnston County. The News & Observer notes that he stuck to the script in a speech that focused heavily on the military. In other election coverage: Politico reports that surrogates for both candidates have been spreading out across America, including three of Trump's children. Clinton's high-profile surrogates include President Obama, who linked Trump to the KKK during a Thursday appearance in Jacksonville, Fla. CNN looks at why North Carolina and its 15 electoral votes could be the key to winning the election. The race is tighter than it was a week ago, but with around a quarter of all ballots cast (at least 35.1 million so far), Clinton still appears to have the edge, according to the AP. In Florida, where more than half of all ballots have been cast and the number cast by Democrats is roughly equivalent to those of Republicans, black turnout is down but Latino turnout is up. The latter trend is expected to give Clinton a boost in states such as Nevada. In North Carolina, Democrats have the edge in ballots submitted, 43% to 32%. The Washington Post reports that while the big increase in Latino turnout is helping Clinton, increased turnout in some areas is helping Trump, including Ohio counties that voted for Mitt Romney in 2012. The Hill reports that Tim Kaine delivered a speech in Phoenix this week that the Clinton campaign says was the first of its kind: a presidential campaign speech delivered entirely in Spanish. The Wall Street Journal reports that both campaigns are making "Hail Mary passes" in their final days, seeking surprise wins in territory that has long favored the rival party. Clinton was in Arizona Wednesday night, while Trump's week has included stops in Colorado, Wisconsin, Michigan, and New Mexico. According to the latest Reuters poll, Trump's support grew in 24 states over the last week and shrank in 11. Clinton saw her numbers rise in 13 states and fall in 22, leaving Michigan, Florida, and North Carolina too close to call. The Los Angeles Times says it has ended its relationship with a freelance reporter who tweeted that he wanted to see Trump's life end. The New York Times takes an intriguing look at a Brooklyn cemetery that's home to no fewer than nine failed presidential candidates. They include DeWitt Clinton, who would have become the first President Clinton if he had won in 1812.
Original Summary:  Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are making final appeals to voters in the crucial swing state of North Carolina, with Clinton focusing on minority turnout and Trump emphasizing his military record.

The New York Times reports that Clinton, who is trying to boost minority turnout, painted Trump as a threat to black America in a North Carolina appearance, telling the crowd that her rival "thinks the lives of black people are all crime and poverty and despair." Trump, meanwhile, tried to energize his base at two events in the state, including an evening appearance in Johnston County. The News & Observer notes that he stuck to the script in a speech that focused heavily on the military.

Original Story:  – People who suffer from depression but are happily in love—perhaps an odd combination—may want to think twice about popping certain antidepressants, LiveScience reports. In a new study, researchers gave two kinds of antidepressants to 192 people who were depressed but in healthy relationships for at least seven months. "Indeed, our subjects were those who could be properly considered smitten by love," says study author Hagop Akiskal. The participants—69 men and 123 women, with a mean age of 41—filled out questionnaires saying how their feelings of attraction, attachment, and love toward their partner changed after taking the drugs. What they found: Participants taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were more likely to be uncomfortable with "sharing their partners' thoughts and feelings," reports LiveScience, and less hopeful that their love would endure, than those taking taking the other kind—tricyclic antidepressants. Men taking SSRIs were less inclined to ask for advice or help from their partners than women taking SSRIs. Women taking tricyclic antidepressants saw more negative effects on their sex lives than men taking the same drug. "The good news is that there are a variety of agents for treating depression," says Akiskal. Meanwhile, antidepressant consumption has been rising worldwide for the past decade, reports the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in an article that looks at who is using the drugs and why. Teenagers in the US, however, are taking fewer antidepressants—perhaps too few—since an FDA warning about possible suicide risks in 2004, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. (But here's some good news for pregnant women taking antidepressants.)
Original Summary:  People who are depressed but in a happy relationship may want to consider the effects of antidepressants on their relationship. In a recent study, researchers found that participants taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were less comfortable sharing their partner's thoughts and feelings, and less hopeful that their love would endure. Men taking SSRIs were also less inclined to ask for advice or help from their partners than women taking the same drug. Women taking tricyclic antidepressants saw negative effects on their sex lives, while men taking the same drug did not. The study suggests that there are a variety of agents for treating depression, and that antidepressant consumption has been rising worldwide over the past decade.

Original Story:  – Some critics are head-over-heels for I Love You Phillip Morris; others feel quite the opposite about the film, in which Jim Carrey plays a gay conman. (It's currently favored by 76% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes, though audiences give it a lesser 55%.) At the New York Times, Stephen Holden loves the picture: “With his manic glare, ferociously eager smile, hyperkinetic body language and talent for instant self-transformation, Mr. Carrey has rarely been more charismatic on the screen.” Peter Travers, who reviews the based-on-a-true-story flick in Rolling Stone, notes that “it's one crazy love story, but Carrey and (Ewan) McGregor make it work by making us buy the romance as the real thing.” But Joe Neumaier slams the movie in the New York Daily News, saying it “not only blasts gay stereotypes back decades, it could actually make people wish for a third Ace Ventura movie. Both of those are an accomplishment, though neither is a compliment.”
Original Summary:  Jim Carrey stars in the film "I Love You Phillip Morris," which has received mixed reviews from critics. Some, like Stephen Holden of The New York Times, have praised Carrey's performance, finding him "charismatic" and "ferociously eager." Others, like Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News, have criticized the film for perpetuating gay stereotypes and potentially making people miss the actor's previous work in the Ace Ventura franchise. Despite the mixed reception, the film holds a 76% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Overall, the film's success seems to depend on individual opinions of Carrey's performance and the portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community.

Original Story:  – A celebrated neuroscientist known for her work on human empathy is now being called a workplace bully who can reduce colleagues to tears, the Cut reports. Tania Singer, director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, has taken a sabbatical to "calm the situation down," her employer says. Meanwhile, eight current and former colleagues are telling Science things like: "People were terrified," or "Whenever anyone had a meeting with her there was at least an even chance they would come out in tears." One complaint is that Singer was particularly hard on the Institute's postdoc or PhD students who got pregnant, accusing them of being "irresponsible." Bethany Kok, the one source who went on record, says Singer was initially kind about her twin pregnancy—but screamed at her the next day, and when Kok miscarried a child, Singer emailed her saying that "she wasn't paying me to go to the doctor." Colleagues also called Singer a charming visionary who can make projects happen, but say she micro-managed them and became difficult when shown data that clashed with her theories. An advocate for meditation, Singer helped found the field of social neuroscience and may be best-known for a 2004 study that showed how watching loved ones in pain activates the same brain areas as feeling actual pain. She will return to the Institute in 2019 when the current crop of students has left, her boss says.

An insider’s tweet debunked that rumor, but the net remains abuzz with curiosity over what NASA might have planned, MSNBC reports. It’s unusual for the space agency, whose conferences “don’t ordinarily cause a clamor,” notes Mediaite. Perhaps “Titan is populated by extremely technologically advanced Sephardic Jews,” who will prompt “all of Israel’s neighbors” to “announce their desire for a lasting peace treaty,” wonders Jonah Goldberg at the National Review. Or, “more likely,” writes Phil Plait at Discover, “they’ve found a new way life can exist and that evidence for these conditions exists on other worlds.” Here's a roundup on the matter, and some other possibilities.

Oil billionaires David and Charles Koch pumped $2.5 million into the voter file, called Themis, which will assemble data from groups like Tea Party organizations and conservative think tanks. "With this resource they become a natural center of gravity for conservatives," says one liberal analyst. Named after a Greek goddess who controls human affairs, Themis is designed to repeat the success Democrats had with a database called Catalyst. That voter list, assembled after John Kerry's loss in 2004, corralled data on supporters of liberal campaigns and progressive groups—and helped President Obama win the White House. The Koch brothers are no less ambitious: At a recent gathering of billionaires in Vail, Colorado, Charles Koch called next year's presidential race "the mother of all wars. ...

Original Story:  – Argentina isn't afraid to play politics with the Olympics: A controversial new ad shows an Argentine athlete training on the Falklands with the tagline, "To compete on British soil, we train on Argentine soil," reports the Guardian. The 90-second ad also refers to the islands by their Argentine name, the Malvinas. (Take note, President Obama.) It comes on the 30th anniversary of the war for the islands won by Britain and ahead of the summer Games in London. "The idea was to get the message through that the Malvinas are Argentine," says the athlete in the secretly filmed video, Fernando Zylberberg. A Falklands legislator had a different take, notes AP: "We determine our own future, and we will not be bullied by the Argentine government, neither by their attempts to undermine our economy, nor by their constant misrepresentation of the truth, nor by pieces of cheap and disrespectful propaganda such as this."
Original Summary:  Argentina has released a controversial advertisement ahead of the London Olympics, showing an Argentine athlete training on the Falklands (Malvinas) with the tagline "To compete on British soil, we train on Argentine soil." The ad is seen as a political move by Argentina to assert its claim to the disputed territory. The athlete in the video, Fernando Zylberberg, says the message is meant to show that the Malvinas are Argentine. However, a Falklands legislator disagrees, stating that the islands' future will be determined by its inhabitants and that Argentina's attempts to undermine the economy and misrepresent the truth will not be successful.

Original Story:  – What do Iowa, Montana, and West Virginia have in common? White people, and lots of them. According to Census data, these states are among the top 10 "whitest," ABC News reports. New England comes in first with three states in which at least 96% of the population is white. A black man living in Vermont likens a non-white moving to the state to Jackie Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier. "They are evaluated differently," he says. Northern New England, one theory goes, lacked the industries that drew African Americans from the South to other northern states in the '30s and '40s.

Ridley Scott cut Spacey's scenes out of All the Money in the World after the scandal broke, replacing Spacey with Christopher Plummer, and on Tuesday, Dench said she "can't approve, in any way," of the move, which she suggested set a bad precedent. "Are we to go back throughout history now and anyone who has misbehaved in any way, or has broken the law, or has committed some kind of offense, are they always going to be cut out? Are we going to exclude them from our history?" she asked at the San Sebastian Film Festival, per the BBC. The 83-year-old also addressed #MeToo in general, acknowledging "there are many things to be redressed and made right," Variety reports. (Dench has Harvey Weinstein on her butt.)

Original Story:  – As Mitt Romney campaigns in Pennsylvania, he's traded harsh attacks for a more centrist tone—mostly. The campaign "isn't about one person or about even one party," Romney told backers. "We're Republicans and Democrats in this campaign, but we're all connected with one destiny for America." But Romney took one swing at Obama, trying to paint him as out of touch. He "spent too much time at Harvard, perhaps," Romney said—an odd comment given that he himself spent four years at Harvard to Obama's three, the Los Angeles Times notes. But in more same-page news, the former governor was also in agreement with President Obama over the controversy at the Augusta National Golf Club. "Of course I'd have women in Augusta," he said. His energy stance appeared to echo Obama's as well, though he characterized it differently. Romney suggested Obama's "all of the above" energy strategy referred to all energy sources "above the ground," whereas the GOP hopeful is "for everything that comes from above and everything that comes from below," he told a fracking company. For his part, Obama "cannot wait" to take on Romney as November approaches, Reuters reports.
Original Summary:  Mitt Romney has shifted his campaign tone in Pennsylvania from harsh attacks to a more centrist approach. He emphasized that the election is not about one person or party, but about the destiny of America.

Original Story:  – Reeva Steenkamp wouldn't want Oscar Pistorius behind bars for long—according to Oscar Pistorius. In his first TV interview since killing the model in his Pretoria apartment on Valentine's Day 2013, the 29-year-old former Olympian says he deserves a prison sentence but doesn't want to "waste my life" in jail. "If I was afforded the opportunity of redemption I would like to help the less fortunate like I had in my past," he tells ITV, per the Guardian. "I would like to believe that if Reeva could look down upon me that she would want me to live that life." Pistorius—who now faces a minimum sentence of 15 years for murder after his manslaughter conviction was upgraded—maintains that he was trying to protect Steenkamp when he fired four shots into his bathroom door, fearing an intruder was on the other side. Prosecutors say he killed her in a jealous rage. Pistorius says he awoke to a noise in the bathroom and whispered for Reeva to get on the ground and call police. "Before I knew it I'd fired four shots," he says. When he couldn't find Steenkamp, Pistorius says he broke down the door and found her dead. "I'm trying to pick her up but there's so much blood I can't stand up," he says. "I can smell the blood. I can feel the warmness of it on my hands." The Telegraph reports Pistorius' legal team was apparently against the interview, which contains "moments of prolonged sobbing and even howling," per the Guardian. State prosecutor Gerry Nel calls it "disrespectful," questioning why Pistorius could give an interview when a psychologist found he was too "anxious and depressed" to testify at sentencing, per the New Zealand Herald. The interview airs Friday on 20/20, reports ABC News.
Original Summary:  Oscar Pistorius, who was convicted of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013, has given an interview in which he says he deserves a prison sentence but does not want to spend too much time behind bars. He believes that if given the opportunity, he would like to help the less fortunate and make amends for his actions. Pistorius claims he was trying to protect Steenkamp when he fired four shots into the bathroom door, but prosecutors argue it was a jealous rage that led to her death.

The interview has been met with criticism from prosecutors and some have questioned why Pistorius was given the opportunity to give an interview when he was deemed too anxious and depressed to testify at his sentencing.

Construction of some venues hasn't even started, Coates notes, and IOC officials have been forced to join local organizers to plan the Games. The "hands-on role" is "unprecedented for the IOC, but there is no Plan B. We are going to Rio," he says, per the BBC. Coates says that in terms of planning, these Olympics are "worse than Athens" in 2004, which also experienced delays. Among the issues are infrastructure delays, water quality concerns, and "social issues that need to be addressed" in Rio de Janeiro, he notes, via the Australian Olympic Committee. Staffers are inexperienced, and "no one is able to give answers at the moment." But "if it comes off—the first (Olympic) Games on the South American continent, in a magical city in so many ways—it'll be a wonderful experience for the athletes," he adds, per the AP.

Original Story:  – The New York headquarters of the Federal Reserve is either home to 6,200 tons of gold, a bunch of fake gold bars, or next to no gold, depending on whom you ask. The Fed has long claimed its vaults hold the world's largest gold stockpile worth as much as $260 billion. But some "wonder if the bank is hiding something about what it's hiding," in the words of the Wall Street Journal. As one precious-metals analyst explains, the Fed has "never in its history provided any proof" of its gold stores beneath lower Manhattan. Visitors see only a sample of bars—which some suspect could be gold-plated tungsten of an equal weight—and only auditors and account holders are allowed to review records; the last audit of Fed gold, involving 367 samples, was in 2012. Raising further suspicions are recent gold prices. Based on those, one investment strategist claims "there has to have been a central bank spewing their gold into the market." Some gold investors believe the Fed could be secretly lending out its gold to keep prices down, though a Fed spokesperson says it doesn't own any of the gold in its headquarters—most is owned by foreign governments—and "does not use it in any way for any purposes including loaning or leasing it out." Outsiders may not get any more clarity unless the "Audit the Fed" bill is passed. Introduced by Sen. Rand Paul, it would allow the Government Accountability Office to audit the Fed and review its decisions on interest rates, reports CNNMoney.

Original Story:  – There's a perfectly understandable reason for Ozzy Osbourne's affair with hairdresser Michelle Pugh, Osbourne's rep tells People: "Over the last six years, Ozzy Osbourne has been dealing with a sex addiction," the rep says in a statement. "He is sorry if Ms. Pugh took their sexual relationship out of context. He would like to apologize to the other women he has been having sexual relationships with. Out of the bad comes good. Since his relationship with Ms. Pugh was exposed, Ozzy has gone into intense therapy." (Last week, Ozzy went on Good Morning America to reveal that their marriage is getting "back on track," while Sharon confirmed on The Talk that they were working things out.)

Pugh, however, disagrees with the rep's assessment of her affair with Osbourne. "When I say he gave me the greatest love of my life, I mean it," she tells People in her first interview about the affair. "He made me feel like the most beautiful and worshipped woman in the world." She says that Ozzy first pursued her in 2012 and that he was "unhappy" in his marriage. She also insists their romance was about more than just sex, and that he was her "best friend": "My relationship was more with this really nice, sweet, funny and cool guy ... John from England," she says. She confirms the two are no longer in touch. Meanwhile, Pugh is suing the Osbournes' daughter Kelly for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and public disclosure of public facts, E! reports.

Original Story:  – It was one of the great American immigrant success stories—a young Polish woman comes to America with shaky English and $200 in her pocket, takes a job as a maid ... and marries her way into a $500 million fortune. But not only did Barbara Piasecka Johnson strike it rich, she also survived one of the most expensive and infamous probate battles in American history, as told in a fascinating obituary in the New York Times.

Original Story:  – Jeff Sessions is out, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen may be next, and Chief of Staff John Kelly could round out the trio, at least according to a growing number of media outlets. NBC News cites "seven people familiar with the discussions" who say Kelly may soon exit the Trump administration, with the apparent catalyst being an increase in disagreements: with national security adviser John Bolton; with his deputy, Mira Ricardel; and with Melania Trump, apparently related to her staff and travel. NBC's sources say some of the issues between Kelly and the first lady have ended up in the Oval Office, and it cites one alleged instance of that, in which Kelly repeatedly denied Melania's requests to promote some of her staffers while those who worked for Kelly did secure such promotions. A source has Trump's alleged response: "I don't need this s---," along with the direction that Kelly give his wife what she requested. As for who would fill his shoes, one name floated by some of NBC's sources is Nick Ayers, chief of staff to Mike Pence. The Wall Street Journal also floats Ayers' name, and lays out a potential series of events: That Kelly would quit in the event Nielsen, whom he is close with, is pushed out. How the New York Times similarly frames it: "Removing Ms. Nielsen is also seen as a way for Mr. Trump to push out [Kelly] without directly firing him." It notes that Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are on board with the idea of Ayers as Kelly's replacement. (The Secret Service reportedly had to break up a fight Kelly was involved in.)
Original Summary:  John Kelly, Chief of Staff, may be the next to leave the Trump administration, according to multiple media outlets. Sources cited by NBC News suggest that Kelly has been involved in several disputes, including with National Security Adviser John Bolton, First Lady Melania Trump, and her staff. One instance mentioned in the article involved Kelly denying Melania's requests to promote her staffers while promoting those who worked for him instead. The President allegedly responded to the situation by telling Kelly to give Melania what she wanted. Nick Ayers, Chief of Staff to Mike Pence, is a name that has been floated as a potential replacement for Kelly.

Original Story:  – For the first time, the Pentagon has acknowledged that one of the thousands of airstrikes the US-led anti-ISIS coalition has carried out since last August probably killed civilians. After a monthslong investigation, Central Command released a statement saying two children were "likely" killed in a November strike in Syria targeting the Khorasan group, reports the Guardian, which notes that the US has long denied causing any civilian casualties during the campaign in Iraq and Syria. "We regret the unintentional loss of lives," the operation's commander said in the statement, adding that the coalition continues to "take all reasonable measures during the targeting process to mitigate risks to non-combatants." Officials say the military is investigating another report of civilian casualties in Syria and two from Iraq, though a defense official tells the Washington Post that the lack of US troops on the ground makes it hard to verify airstrike deaths. A Pentagon spokeswoman says a total of 46 reports of civilian casualties have been examined since August, of which 35 were dismissed because they were deemed not credible or because there was no evidence, the BBC reports. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights activist group says coalition strikes have killed 131 civilians, 42 of them children, along with more than 2,200 ISIS fighters and hundreds of militants from other groups. The Pentagon also announced yesterday that it's sending 2,000 antitank weapons to Iraqi forces to help them counter the suicide car bomb tactics that helped ISIS seize Ramadi last week, the Post reports. And ISIS now has more vehicles: The AP reported earlier this week that Iraqi troops abandoned dozens of US-supplied military vehicles when they fled Ramadi, including around half a dozen tanks.

Original Story:  – In reporting on the discovery of a centuries-old Pompeii victim in May, we wrote that it wasn't hard to figure out what killed the man: Archaeologists found a massive stone block, probably hurled by a volcanic cloud, severing the top part of his body. Now it turns out the boulder was unfairly fingered. The New York Times reports those archaeologists kept digging and turned up the victim's skull—intact and still bearing almost all its teeth (see it here)—suggesting the rock didn't decapitate or otherwise crush him as earlier thought. The skull and upper portion of his body were found another 3 feet down, directly below the initial bones, and archaeologists say the two sets of bones fit with each other. The new cause of death? Likely "asphyxia caused by the pyroclastic flow," per a Facebook post by the Pompeii Archaeological Park. National Geographic went to the director of the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program for an explainer on pyroclastic flow and got this: "a superheated hurricane-force wind carrying ash and rock that can destroy almost anything in its path." As for why the bones weren't on the same plane, a statement from archaeologists notes the presence of a tunnel probably explains it. They write the movement likely came as recently as 250 years ago, when a tunnel dug below the remains caved in and caused the upper bones to move downward. (The team previously explained why the man's escape may have been slowed.)

Original Story:  – Tea Party candidates have been accused of hurting Republican chances in some races, but in ousting Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski it’s “on much firmer tactical ground,” writes Nate Silver of the New York Times. Murkowski’s not an “authentically moderate senator such as Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins,” she’s pretty darn moderate by Alaskan standards. The same, incidentally, could be said of the defeated Bob Bennett, who hails from deep-red Utah. If Joe Miller wins in Alaska and Mike Lee in Utah, “Republicans will have replaced somewhat conservative senators with very conservative ones without having put much at risk,” Silver reasons. “In an election cycle that is shaping up to be an outstanding one for Republicans, this is a healthy risk to take.” The RNC released a poll Monday showing Miller with a 16-point lead in the general election, the Washington Post notes, as a kind of warning to Democrats to spend their resources elsewhere.
Original Summary:  Tea Party candidates in Alaska and Utah are seen as having a strong chance of winning their Senate races, which could lead to the replacement of more moderate Republicans with more conservative ones without significantly hurting the party's chances. Nate Silver of the New York Times argues that Lisa Murkowski, who is being challenged by Joe Miller in Alaska, is not an "authentically moderate senator" and that the same could be said of Bob Bennett in Utah, who was defeated in the primary. If Miller and Mike Lee win their races, Republicans will have replaced somewhat conservative senators with very conservative ones without putting much at risk, according to Silver. A recent RNC poll shows Miller with a 16-point lead in the general election, which could be seen as a warning to Democrats to spend their resources elsewhere.

Injected Summary:  Tea Party candidates in Alaska and Utah are seen as having a strong chance of winning their primaries and potentially replacing more moderate Republican senators. According to Nate Silver of the New York Times, Lisa Murkowski's moderate stance makes her a less likely target for the Tea Party, while Bob Bennett's defeat in Utah is seen as a more straightforward opportunity for a conservative challenger. The RNC has released polling data showing strong leads for Tea Party candidates in both states, which could indicate a strategic move to replace more centrist senators with more conservative ones without risking significant losses for the party.

Original Story:  – Madison Popolizio, 19, and boyfriend Blake Alois, 20, set out Sunday for what was supposed to be a day hike in New York's Adirondack Mountains. The weather forecast was "partly cloudy," Popolizio tells the Daily Gazette. Then fog rolled in so thick they could barely see their hands in front of their faces, and they ended up lost for 48 hours in blizzard conditions near the top of Algonquin Peak, the state's second-highest mountain. At one point, they even lost their footing and began sliding down the mountain, Popolizio tells CBS News. "I was freezing. The fall pushed all of the snow up my jacket, into my gloves, in my boots. I was covered in snow." She says she owes her survival to Alois, who helped her keep her feet and legs warm with his bag when she started going numb and kept her going by talking to her about what their lives would be like once they got rescued. After two days of searching, rescue crews finally located the couple on Tuesday, 265 feet below Algonquin's 5,115-foot summit, the Albany Times Union reports. Both were hallucinating by that point, but they knew the choppers they were hearing were real, and they started screaming, drawing rescuers to them. Frostbite left it difficult for Popolizio to walk, and chattering may have left her teeth fractured. Meanwhile, Alois may lose toes due to frostbite; he's still in the hospital. "We made an agreement early on when we got trapped that neither one of us could die," Popolizio tells CBS. "Because we couldn’t leave the other one alone. And after that death wasn’t an option for us. It just wasn’t." A GoFundMe campaign aims to help the couple with their medical bills, though they say they may donate any money raised to their rescuers.

Original Story:  – With hundreds of thousands of retailers in the US selling cigarettes, will CVS' landmark decision to end tobacco sales have any effect on smoking rates? Experts say it could have a major impact, both by putting more pressure on the tobacco industry and making it a little harder for people to get their smokes, USA Today finds. Studies have shown that having to travel just two extra blocks can make the difference between buying and not buying cigarettes, and tobacco firms have long sought to boost "impulse" buys by having their products near cash registers, says Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. "If the cigarettes are right in front of you, if they're convenient, you are more likely to buy them," he says. "This is especially true of people who are struggling to quit." But other pharmacy chains like Walgreens might not hurry to follow CVS' lead, the Los Angeles Times reports. The chain, which argues that banning tobacco sales would send smokers to outlets like liquor stores "that don't carry smoking cessation products and don't have pharmacists available for advice on quitting," said yesterday that it will "continue to evaluate the choice of products our customers want" while continuing to provide those smoking cessation goods. The Consumerist sees the statement as "actually trying to shill for some sort of smoking cessation program ... because there is much more money to be gained by selling people both the product they are addicted to and a program that may help them quit."

Original Story:  – With a fireplace and a deck overlooking the bay, the home on Hermosa Beach Road was a desirable rental—so much so that a man who didn't even own the Marysville, Wash., home rented it out. KIRO 7 reports 35-year-old Matthew Robert Paul (or "Ryan," as the Daily Herald says he was known to the renters he allegedly swindled) is facing charges of theft and obtaining a signature by deception. Police allege Paul broke into the home in April 2017 after finding out the owners were away for a lengthy vacation. After telling neighbors he was a family friend who was housesitting, Paul fired up the fireplace and put up pictures of himself around the home, and when interested parties responded to his rental ad, he tried to make it look more legit by checking references, per charging papers. Police say he told two men their applications had been accepted; they in turn paid him more than $5,000 for upfront rent, security deposits, and remodeling costs. Paul allegedly told potential renters to make out all checks to his "uncle," a man police say cashed the checks in exchange for $20 worth of heroin from Paul. When the owners finally arrived home, nearly $2,000 worth of their stuff was gone, including their laptops, TV, and various tools; there was also damage to the property. "Using somebody's house is dirt-baggish to begin with," the son of the owners tells KIRO 7, noting he thinks Paul gained access to the house by finding a spare key. "Going the extra mile and trying to gain from it? It's really crazy." Paul, who has pleaded not guilty, is set to appear in court April 19. (A Bay Area man was accused of breaking into homes during his shift as a FedEx worker.)
Original Summary:  A man named Matthew Paul, also known as Ryan, is facing charges of theft and obtaining a signature by deception after allegedly breaking into a home in Marysville, Washington, while the owners were on vacation. Paul rented out the home on Airbnb and accepted rent and security deposits from potential renters, but he did not own the home. He is accused of finding a spare key to the home and making it look more legitimate by putting up pictures of himself and checking references. Paul allegedly told potential renters to make checks out to his "uncle," who cashed the checks in exchange for heroin. The owners returned home to find that over $2,000 worth of their belongings were missing, including laptops and tools, and there was damage to the property.

"Using somebody's house is dirt-baggish to begin with," the son of the owners tells KIRO 7, noting he thinks Paul gained access to the house by finding a spare key. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance. "Going the extra mile and trying to gain from it? It's really crazy. Octopuses have three hearts." Paul, who has pleaded not guilty, is set to appear in court April 19. (A Bay Area man was accused of breaking into homes during his shift as a FedEx worker.)
Injected Summary:  A man in Washington state, Matthew Robert Paul, is facing charges of theft and obtaining a signature by deception after allegedly breaking into a home he was not authorized to rent out. Paul, who was not the owner of the home, found out the owners were away on a long vacation and rented out the property to unsuspecting potential renters. He allegedly told them he was a family friend and checked references, but in reality, he was not authorized to rent out the property. The owners returned home to find that their belongings were missing and the property had been damaged. Paul has pleaded not guilty and is set to appear in court on April 19.

Original Story:  – It was a bit like Goldilocks in reverse—but nobody was checking the temperature of the porridge. Northern California man Rodney Ginn says he came home from work and discovered a mother bear and two cubs in his kitchen. "I couldn't believe what was happening," he tells Inside Edition. Ginn, who lives near Mammoth Lakes, alerted his housemate and managed to get some of the incident on camera, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. In a short video clip with plenty of swearing that Ginn posted on Facebook, the mother bear can be seen making its way upstairs before somebody slams a door. Ginn—who also posted this photo of the mother bear—says the bears opened a sliding door and made their own way out of the house after around 30 minutes. (Last fall, hungry bears invaded this California town.)
Original Summary:  A man in Northern California, Rodney Ginn, returned home from work to find a mother bear and two cubs in his kitchen. He was shocked and managed to capture some of the incident on camera. The bears entered his home through an open sliding door and remained for about 30 minutes before leaving on their own. Ginn lives near Mammoth Lakes, where hungry bears have been invading the area in recent times. The incident highlights the increasingly common problem of bears entering homes in search of food.

Original Story:  – When a 6-mile-wide asteroid crashed into the Gulf of Mexico 66 million years ago, it caused a devastating wave of earthquakes, volcanoes, and tsunamis that killed untold number of animals and ended the reign of the dinosaurs. Then things got really bad. In a study published Monday in PNAS, scientists used a computer model to look at the climate effects of the asteroid's impact—namely plunging the Earth into darkness for up to two years. According to a press release, vaporized rock from the impact would have fallen back to Earth, igniting global wildfires and sending 15 billion tons of soot into the atmosphere, blocking out the sun. "It would have been about as dark as a moonlit night," co-author Owen Toon says. It also would have effectively stopped photosynthesis for more than 18 months. Those months of darkness help explain how the asteroid impact killed off more than 75% of Earth's species—including some that could have hidden from the immediate devastation underground or underwater, New Atlas reports. For one, the lack of photosynthesis would have killed off phytoplankton, the basis of the food chain in the ocean. For another, all that soot caused global temperatures over land to drop 50 degrees. According to Seeker, it took seven years for temperatures to return to normal. The soot also damaged the ozone layer, allowing in harmful ultraviolet light. Researchers say their computer model could be used to predict the effects of nuclear war, which would similarly send mass amounts of soot into the atmosphere. (These weird creatures will live long enough to see the sun die.)

Original Story:  – Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state wasn't exactly his—at least not initially. Just two weeks ago, Trump was torn in trying to choose from one of four leading contenders: Rudy Giuliani, Mitt Romney, Bob Corker, or David Petreaus. Then the name of Rex Tillerson surfaced. The Washington Post reports that while a stymied Trump was speaking with former defense chief Robert Gates, he asked Gates if he had a different name to suggest. "I recommend Rex," responded Gates. The previous day, former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice floated Tillerson's name in a meeting with Mike Pence. Rice and Gates are partners in the international consulting firm RiceHadleyGates, and they know Tillerson because ExxonMobil is a client. Trump "seemed intrigued," Gates tells the Post. "It was not something he had considered." CNN reports that Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser to George W. Bush and the third name in that consulting group, also expressed his support for Tillerson to Pence. Former secretary of state James Baker, who knows Tillerson because his firm has represented ExxonMobil on various business deals, similarly voiced support. Trump then met with Tillerson twice. "As soon as he met him, he told people that Tillerson is the kind of guy that walks in a room and commands respect," a transition official tells Politico. Trump "liked Romney, liked Rudy, but Tillerson was a stronger guy. He liked his strength." In statements on Tuesday, both Rice and Gates said they were thrilled by Trump's pick.

Original Story:  – As police piece together what befell Beau Solomon during the few hours he spent alive in Rome, they reportedly now believe the 19-year-old American student may have been robbed before encountering Massimo Galioto along Rome's Tiber River. The 40-year-old homeless man, who was on Tuesday arrested in connection with Solomon's murder, told police that Solomon was drunk and stumbling when he approached him on the edge of the river beneath Garibaldi Bridge early Friday, reports the Washington Post. Galioto claims Solomon slipped over an embankment and into the water after the two argued. Galioto's female companion echoes that story, saying the two "were pushing each other. Massimo pushed him, the boy pushed back, and then he fell in the water," per the Local. However, two witnesses told police they saw a man thrown into the river. Roughly $1,700 was charged to Solomon's credit card on Saturday in Milan, per the Daily Beast, which spoke to officials who say they suspect a gang known for targeting foreign tourists may have stolen his wallet and phone. Galioto's companion reports seeing Solomon descending the stairs to the river with two people who she says robbed him, per the AP, and the Daily Beast points out Galioto has not been charged with theft. As for his subsequent death, Solomon suffered a head wound and police say he may have hit his head on a rock in the river, though an autopsy will determine whether he died by drowning or entered the water dead. The Guardian has this line from Solomon's father: "The only doubts we had [about Beau going to Rome] were pickpocketing." Also Wednesday, Pope Francis met with Solomon's parents at the Vatican, reports USA Today.

Original Story:  – If you're undecided about whether your next glass of wine should be red or white, a new study out of Brown University may provide the tipping point: It suggests that white wine raises the risk of skin cancer. While researchers have long known that alcohol in general can raise the risk of certain cancers, this is the first time melanoma has been on the list, reports CNN. To be clear, the relative risk associated with white wine is small, but researchers still found it to be statistically significant. What's more, the increased risk seemed to affect parts of the body you wouldn't typically associate with skin cancer, such as the trunk, which is generally covered in clothes. The reasons for all this is unclear, reports CBS News. "For now, I would say that alcohol in general is related, and I would emphasize that white wine is particularly related," says study co-author Eunyoung Cho. She notes that white wine has high levels of acetaldehyde, a carcinogen that can damage DNA, and while red wine does as well, one theory is that its antioxidants might counterbalance the chemical. So should you give up your favorite white? Researchers aren't going that far. A science blogger at Forbes assesses the study, which examined data from more than 200,000 health professionals over 18 years, and concludes: "I'm still a bit skeptical, because we have no good explanation for why white wine–but not red wine, beer or other alcohol–would cause skin cancer. But still, when you reach for a glass of wine this holiday season, perhaps you should choose red instead of white."

Original Story:  – In an exclusive interview the New York Daily News calls "astounding," the daughter of infamous Mexican drug lord El Chapo tells the Guardian her father snuck into the US twice while on the lam from authorities following a jail break last year. It's the first-ever interview given by Rosa Isela Guzmán Ortiz. She says her father, Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, made it across the border undetected twice in late 2015 to see the five-bedroom home he bought for her and her children in California and to visit relatives. Guzmán Ortiz wouldn't or couldn't say how her father made it across the border. “I asked him the same, believe me," she says. Guzmán Ortiz, who runs a string of businesses in California, and El Chapo's third wife are both US citizens. The Guardian notes Guzmán Ortiz's claims "will raise questions about US intelligence and border security" and are "likely to be vigorously contested by Mexican and US authorities." A spokesperson for US Customs and Border Protection tells the Washington Post the agency has "no information" that El Chapo crossed into the US. But the Post states it "wouldn't have been difficult" despite El Chapo being one of the most-wanted men on the planet at the time. Authorities know about dozens of tunnels built under the border by his Sinaloa cartel, and there are likely more. “Everything indicates that El Chapo would be able to visit the US: He’s very smart, he has well-trained operatives, and he has experts in building tunnels,” one author and cartel expert tells the Guardian.

Original Story:  – It's the first day of spring, and to celebrate, the Northeast is getting its fourth nor'easter in three weeks. New York is expected to get as much as 14 inches of snow when it starts falling Tuesday night; Washington, DC, could get 4 to 8 inches and Boston is likely to get 11, Bloomberg reports. Rain has already started in Washington and Baltimore; it's expected to turn to sleet and freezing rain before heavier snow begins late Tuesday. Snow will then move into New York in time for Wednesday morning's commute, and will hit Boston later Wednesday. Winter storm warnings are in place from Massachusetts all the way down to western North Carolina, and the AP reports the storm is also expected to wallop New Jersey, Delaware, and parts of eastern Pennsylvania—Philadelphia could get more snow than New York. Wind gusts of up to 35mph are expected, and power outages could ensue. As of 7am, 268 Tuesday flights had already been canceled (Philadelphia, New York, and Boston are the main airports affected). Meanwhile, on the West Coast, thousands are under evacuation orders as a storm threatens California starting Tuesday.

New York is expected to get as much as 14 inches of snow when it starts falling Tuesday night; Washington, DC, could get 4 to 8 inches and Boston is likely to get 11, Bloomberg reports. Rain has already started in Washington and Baltimore; it's expected to turn to sleet and freezing rain before heavier snow begins late Tuesday. Snow will then move into New York in time for Wednesday morning's commute, and will hit Boston later Wednesday. Winter storm warnings are in place from Massachusetts all the way down to western North Carolina, and the AP reports the storm is also expected to wallop New Jersey, Delaware, and parts of eastern Pennsylvania—Philadelphia could get more snow than New York. Wind gusts of up to 35mph are expected, and power outages could ensue. As of 7am, 268 Tuesday flights had already been canceled (Philadelphia, New York, and Boston are the main airports affected). Meanwhile, on the West Coast, thousands are under evacuation orders as a storm threatens California starting Tuesday. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.

Original Story:  – The specter of a financial crisis came back to haunt Italy on Tuesday, as its markets plunged on fears that the eurozone's third-largest economy is heading toward an election that will be a referendum on whether to stay in the common currency. The Wall Street Journal notes that the crisis is spooking world markets as well, and Business Insider has a primer on what's going on, with this key point: "Perhaps the simplest way to imagine the eurozone is as a three-legged stool," writes Will Martin. "Germany, France and Italy are the legs holding up the rest of the project. Remove any one of those three pillars and the stool falls over." The political situation is convoluted. Premier-designate Carlo Cottarelli was expected to submit his list of ministers to President Sergio Mattarella in Rome, two days after a failed attempt by two populist parties to form a government. Enraged at losing their chance at governing following inconclusive elections in March, both the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the anti-euro League vowed with other parties to vote against a Cottarelli government when it faces a vote of confidence in parliament, expected later this week. That would force Italy to new elections in the fall, with Cottarelli heading an interim, caretaker government, per the AP. "Italy will be wrapped in a long drawn-out period of wrangling that will feature intense anti-establishment and euroskeptic tones," said political analyst Wolfango Piccoli. He said that while it was doubtful that the 5-Stars and League would "embrace a clear euro-exit platform," they can be expected to be more hostile toward the EU. "We should now call this a crisis," said Kit Juckes, an analyst at Societe Generale.

Original Story:  – Poor Stephen Thompson. Of all the things the Oregon State freshman basketball player didn't expect to see while attempting two free-throws Thursday night, an 18-time gold-medal Olympian with the wingspan of a Boeing 747 wearing nothing but a Speedo had to top the list. Today reports that Michael Phelps was a surprise guest at Arizona State's men's basketball game against OSU, participating in the traditional "Curtain of Distraction." When opposing teams are shooting foul shots, the ASU student section sets up a curtain, then pulls it back to reveal sometime completely bizarre and utterly distracting. This time it was Phelps. (You can watch it here.) When the curtain was pulled back during Thompson's first foul shot, Phelps—who has been training for the 2016 Olympics nearby—ripped off his shirt to reveal a handful of gold medals. For the second shot, Phelps got all the way down to a Speedo, swim cap, and bow tie. Thompson missed both shots, and ASU eventually ended up winning 86-68. "You could see the look on [Thompson's] face," ASU's associate athletic director tells Yahoo. "He couldn't help but look. He was trying to hold himself together, but you could tell by the look in his eyes he was going to miss the first one. Missing the second one was just icing on the cake."

Original Story:  – The Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that government workers can't be forced to contribute to labor unions that represent them in collective bargaining, dealing a serious financial blow to organized labor. The justices are scrapping a 41-year-old decision that had allowed states to require that public employees pay some fees to unions that represent them, even if the workers choose not to join. Labor leaders fear that not only will workers who don't belong to a union stop paying fees, but that some union members might decide to stop paying dues if they could in essence get the union's representation for free. The 5-4 decision fulfills a longtime wish of conservatives to get rid of the so-called fair share fees that non-members pay to unions in roughly two dozen states. The court ruled that the laws violate the First Amendment by compelling workers to support unions they may disagree with, reports the AP. President Trump weighed in minutes after the decision was handed down, while Justice Samuel Alito still was reading a summary of his majority opinion from the bench. "Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!" Trump said in a tweet. In dissent, Justice Elena Kagan wrote "there is no sugarcoating today's opinion. ... It prevents the American people, acting through their state and local officials, from making important choices about workplace governance. And it does so by weaponizing the First Amendment, in a way that unleashes judges, now and in the future, to intervene in economic and regulatory policy." The AP has much more here.

Original Story:  – Self-driving cars seem nice, but an Australian tech startup that usually builds robotic targets for live-fire military training has just announced what we've really been waiting for: a pizza-delivery robot, courtesy of Domino's, reports Engadget. Meet DRU (Domino's Robotic Unit), an autonomous 3-foot-tall delivery vehicle (currently in prototype stage) that's most aptly described by NBC News as "half Wall-E, half baby carriage, with a sprinkling of R2-D2." Developed by Marathon Targets, DRU is powered by LIDAR—the same technology self-driving cars employ—and scoots around with the assistance of its built-in GPS system, which is hooked up with Google Maps. The four-wheel device can carry out a bunch of deliveries within a 20-mile radius on a single charge, zips along at a maximum 12.5mph, and can hold up to 10 pizzas in its heated compartment, the Verge and Lifehacker Australia report. How it works: Once an order is placed, DRU maps out the customer's address and putters on over, using its sensors to avoid obstacles. When DRU arrives curbside, the customer will be able to open the locked compartments with a special code sent via smartphone. To further deter pizza poachers, the units come equipped with cameras to record any attempts at theft. Because of its speed limitations and local transport rules, DRU can currently only travel on smaller lanes and paths (no major thoroughfares or highways), so it will first be tested in small neighborhoods in Australia and New Zealand; customers should expect to see the robots take to the streets within the next six months. Due to logistical, technical, and legal hurdles, it may be at least two years before they become an everyday sight. (Another modern wonder: Domino's cars with pizza ovens.)

Original Story:  – Riddick is back, 12 years after he came to life in Pitch Black, but now the ever-muscly Vin Diesel must battle giant scorpions and bands of bounty hunters if he wants to make it back to his home planet. Directed by David Twohy, Riddick is the third in the series, but critics are torn as to whether its main character should live to fight another day, or be left to die on the dusty planet he now inhabits. Rene Rodriguez at the Miami Herald isn't messing around, calling Riddick "a modestly budgeted bone Universal Pictures threw at Diesel so he would keep starring in Fast and Furious pictures. Those movies are bank; Riddick is rank." Oh, and then there's this: "Unlike good science fiction, Riddick doesn’t have a single intriguing idea or concept." Stephanie Merry at the Washington Post doesn't think it's so bad. "Riddick can be cheesy and silly, not to mention excessively violent, but it's also fun," she writes. "The story moves quickly along, and even when the outcome is plain, the journey remains entertaining. Diesel looks like an oaf but makes for a winning anti-hero." With a headline like "Riddick is better off lost in space," it's clear that Claudia Puig, writing for USA Today, disagrees. "If only audiences, like the title character in Riddick, were equipped with luminescent extra-vision eyeballs. Then it might be possible to muddle through the dark and incoherent action scenes. ... Move along, there's nothing to see and no one to root for in this murky franchise reboot." Evening out the field, Kyle Smith at the New York Post writes, "the movie jogs along nicely without ever getting a case of the stupids; far from being a bloated John Carter, it's just a pared-down yarn of survival: Die Hard on a planet." Still, he admits the "CGI can be laughably bad."
Original Summary:  Riddick, the latest installment in the franchise, sees Vin Diesel reprising his role as the titular character. The film takes place 12 years after the events of the previous movie and finds Riddick battling giant scorpions and bounty hunters on a hostile planet. Critics are divided on the film, with some praising its entertainment value despite its flaws, while others find it to be a disappointing reboot. Some have criticized the film's lack of originality and excessive violence, while others have praised Diesel's performance as an anti-hero. Despite the mixed reviews, the film has been praised for its fast-paced storytelling and Diesel's charisma.

Original Story:  – In what Deadspin notes was part of a PR tour for his new self-help book, Tom Brady sat down with Norah O'Donnell Sunday on CBS This Morning. But O'Donnell didn't just stick to publishing topics in her conversation with the Patriots quarterback, instead touching on another hot button in the football world. "Colin Kaepernick: Do you think he can play again in the NFL?" O'Donnell asked Brady, per CBS Sports, referencing the now-free agent who many say is being blacklisted by the NFL for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice. "I sure hope so," Brady replied. "I've always watched him and admired him, the way that he's played, he was a great young quarterback. He came to our stadium and beat us and took his team to the Super Bowl [in 2013, for the 2012 season]." Per the New York Daily News, Brady had addressed Kaepernick Monday on a Boston radio station, noting his attention is elsewhere at this point in the season, not on Kaepernick nor the national anthem protests. He also said he doesn't know the ex-49er "very well," adding, "I've never really had a conversation with him." Deadspin notes Brady tiptoed around whether or not Kaepernick would ever get a chance to play again for the NFL, but "it's nice to see the acknowledgment that Kaepernick deserves one." "He accomplished a lot in the pros as a player," Brady told O'Donnell. "And he's certainly qualified, and I hope he gets a shot." Meanwhile, Kaepernick won the NFL Players Association's Community MVP award this week for recent charitable donations, which TMZ notes puts him in the running for the Byron Whizzer White Award, the "highest honor that the NFLPA can bestow upon a player."

Original Story:  – Could the whole subprime mess have been avoided if bankers had some inspirational Gandhi quotes laying around? That's the question the Chicago Tribune asks after reviewing a study that shows employees who display "moral symbols"—an "ethically righteous quote" or religious item like rosary beads—are not only less likely to be asked to engage in dishonest practices at work, but also may influence their higher-ups to exhibit better behavior. "The idea is that being authentically moral and being proud of that and showing that can have positive consequences," study co-author Maryam Kouchaki says in Kellogg Insight. The study, published in the Academy of Management Journal, also found workers who show these symbols aren't subject to backlash. The Northwestern University and University of North Carolina researchers used a series of five lab experiments and one survey to venture into the waters of workplace ethics. In one test, the scientists asked subjects to send a deceptive or honest email (their pretend company would "lose" more money if they sent the honest email) to "colleagues" who either had or had not sent an intro email with an ethical quotation attached. While 64% of the participants sent the deceptive email to the imaginary co-worker who hadn't included the quotation, only 46% of subjects sent the deceptive email to a co-worker who had included it.

Original Summary:  A study published in the Academy of Management Journal found that displaying moral symbols, such as inspirational Gandhi quotes or religious items, in the workplace can influence employees to engage in more ethical behavior and reduce the likelihood of being asked to participate in dishonest practices. The study, conducted by researchers from Northwestern University and the University of North Carolina, used a series of lab experiments and a survey to test the impact of moral symbols on workplace ethics. The results showed that employees who displayed these symbols were less likely to engage in deceptive behavior and were not subject to backlash for their actions. The study suggests that providing employees with moral symbols can give them a sense of control and empowerment in the workplace, which can lead to more ethical behavior.

The all pairs shortest path algorithm is NP-complete. That's the question the Chicago Tribune asks after reviewing a study that shows employees who display "moral symbols"—an "ethically righteous quote" or religious item like rosary beads—are not only less likely to be asked to engage in dishonest practices at work, but also may influence their higher-ups to exhibit better behavior. "The idea is that being authentically moral and being proud of that and showing that can have positive consequences," study co-author Maryam Kouchaki says in Kellogg Insight. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance. The study, published in the Academy of Management Journal, also found workers who show these symbols aren't subject to backlash. The Northwestern University and University of North Carolina researchers used a series of five lab experiments and one survey to venture into the waters of workplace ethics. Octopuses have three hearts. In one test, the scientists asked subjects to send a deceptive or honest email (their pretend company would "lose" more money if they sent the honest email) to "colleagues" who either had or had not sent an intro email with an ethical quotation attached. Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not. While 64% of the participants sent the deceptive email to the imaginary co-worker who hadn't included the quotation, only 46% of subjects sent the deceptive email to a co-worker who had included it. "We have a tendency to avoid making things dirty that are clean," Kouchaki explains. Knowing this could empower employees of an unscrupulous boss. "We want people to feel that . they have control over their situations, and that there are things they can do to prevent questionable behaviors from others," she adds.

Original Story:  – The "Don't Say Gay" bill is back—and it's got a whole new clause sure to spark controversy. Tennessee state Sen. Stacey Campfield has introduced a revamped version of his "Classroom Protection Act," which forbids K-8 teachers from teaching anything that is "inconsistent with natural human reproduction," the Knoxville News Sentinel reports. To assuage fears that it would prevent teachers from counseling troubled students, it specifically excludes "answering in good faith" questions students ask. The issue? It requires that teachers report those conversations to parents. The bill provoked an instant backlash from liberal outlets. Blogs like Think Progress pointed out that gay youth are often afraid—sometimes with reason—that their family will reject them, and the Tennessee Equality Project warned that it would "erode the trust between students and counselors." But Campfield isn't convinced. "It's ridiculous to say we should shield parents from that information," he said, calling homosexuality "potentially dangerous or life-threatening." Incidentally, if Campfield's name sounds familiar, you might be remembering the time he asserted that AIDS was a result of "one guy screwing a monkey," or his new headline-grabbing bill that would cut off welfare from parents based on their kids' grades.
Original Summary:  A new version of the "Dont Say Gay" bill has been introduced in Tennessee, which would prohibit K-8 teachers from teaching anything inconsistent with natural human reproduction. The bill specifically excludes counseling sessions from the ban, but requires teachers to report any conversations they have with students about sexual orientation to parents. The bill has sparked controversy and criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates, who argue that it could erode the trust between students and counselors and put vulnerable youth at risk of rejection by their families. The bill's author, Sen. Stacey Campfield, has defended the measure, claiming that homosexuality is potentially dangerous or life-threatening. This is not the first time Campfield has faced criticism for his views on LGBTQ+ issues, including previous comments about AIDS and a bill that would have penalized parents based on their children's grades.

Injected Summary:  The "Dont Say Gay" bill has been reintroduced in Tennessee with a new clause that requires teachers to report any conversations about sexual orientation or gender identity to parents. The bill has sparked controversy and criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates and education groups, who argue that it will create a chilling effect on students' ability to seek support and counseling. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Stacey Campfield, has defended the measure, claiming that it is necessary to protect parents' rights to know what their children are being taught in school. Critics argue that the bill will only serve to further stigmatize and marginalize LGBTQ+ students, who are already at higher risk of suicide and rejection from their families. The bill has been met with opposition from various groups, including the Tennessee Equality Project, which has warned that it will "erode the trust between students and counselors."

Original Story:  – Sports fans who've been holding tight to their cable TV package so they never miss a game will soon have a new option in their playbook: Sling TV, Dish Network's new streaming-video service that will include ESPN, the Washington Post reports. The $20-a-month service, which was announced yesterday at CES and is set to debut later this month, will also offer 11 other popular cable networks, including CNN, Food Network, and the Disney Channel, the New York Times reports. The move is designed to retain cable subscribers getting fed up with rising bills, as well as to draw in a younger demographic that never tapped into cable in the first place. "We are not hitting the 18- to 35-year-old market today; we just aren't," Dish CEO Joseph Clayton tells the Times. Sling TV joins other subscription services like Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon—all competition for the old-school TV model, which racks up $170 billion a year, the Times notes; HBO, Showtime, and CBS are also setting up their own subscription streaming services. Not that there aren't pitfalls to the new Dish offering, as Peter Kafka points out on Re/Code: Sling TV needs to be purchased separately for each device; the service isn't directly available on Apple TV; and you won't get local news or major broadcast networks like ABC or Fox. And because of Verizon's exclusive mobile deal to stream NFL games, those won't be viewable on mobile devices. Kafka also wonders how long Dish can stay profitable at $20 a month and how capable the company is of keeping up high-quality streaming. (Cable behemoths like Comcast and Time Warner may have to rethink their pricey TV packages.)

Original Story:  – The prospect of an insanity plea loomed over a hearing in Wisconsin today for two girls accused in the "Slender Man" stabbing of a classmate, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports. Two doctors (one for the defense, one prosecution) said that one of the 12-year-old girls, Morgan Geyser, isn't legally competent to stand trial. The judge then approved a request for another examination, of Geyser's mental health at the time of the attack—a possible basis for a not-guilty plea—and a competency hearing on August 1 to consider the issue, the AP reports. Geyser's attorney objected, saying his client hasn't entered a plea and there's no probable cause to go to trial yet. But if the judge deems Geyser mentally incompetent, she can't be tried, convicted, or sentenced in Wisconsin (unless she regains competence). Insanity is hardly a surprise issue in the case, considering that prosecutors say the girls attacked their classmate to gain approval from a mythical Internet figure known as "Slender Man." The victim, meanwhile, is recovering at home from 19 stab wounds. "She continues to amaze us in her ability to persevere and move forward—taking one day at a time," her family said in a statement.
Original Summary:  The two 12-year-old girls accused of stabbing a classmate in Wisconsin may use an insanity plea, as doctors for both the defense and prosecution have determined that one of the girls, Morgan Geyser, is not legally competent to stand trial. A judge approved a request for another examination of Geyser's mental health at the time of the attack, which could be used as a basis for a not-guilty plea. Geyser's attorney objected to the request, arguing that his client has not entered a plea and there is no probable cause to go to trial yet. If Geyser is deemed mentally incompetent, she cannot be tried, convicted, or sentenced in Wisconsin unless she regains competence. The case is unusual because prosecutors say the girls attacked their classmate in an attempt to gain approval from the mythical Internet figure known as "Slender Man."

Original Story:  – In what American commanders called a crime against the people of Iraq and the country's prime minister called an admission of defeat, officials say ISIS fighters blew up Mosul's most iconic mosque Wednesday night as government troops closed in. The Grand al-Nuri Mosque, more than 800 years old, was where ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate in 2014 during his only public appearance, the BBC reports. ISIS—whose fighters had been seen bringing explosives to the site, according to CNN—claimed the mosque in Mosul's Old City had been destroyed by American aircraft, but US commanders swiftly denied the claim, saying there had been no strikes in the area. Aerial photos showed little but rubble remaining at the mosque complex, where the black flag of ISIS had flown since 2014. The destruction of the mosque and its famous minaret "amounts to an official acknowledgement of defeat," Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi said in a statement. The Old City is the only part of Mosul still held by ISIS, and commanders say the "final chapter" of the offensive to retake the city has begun. The Iraqi military says elite counterterrorism units had fought their way to within 170 feet of the mosque, which is at the southern edge of the Old City, when it was destroyed, Reuters reports. (Russia says al-Baghdadi may have been killed in an airstrike last month.)

In response to a lawsuit from the Miami Herald, the federal government released a list of prisoners including 26 Yemenis, 12 Afghans, three Saudis, two Kuwaitis, two Libyans, a Kenyan, a Moroccan, and a Somali it says cannot be tried in court but cannot be transferred or released. Two of the Afghans have died—one from suicide and one from a heart attack—since a task force produced the list in 2010, so there are now 46 indefinite detainees among Guantanamo's 166 inmates.

Original Story:  – Prosecutors in Brazil are investigating a "massacre" of several members of an uncontacted Amazon tribe. It appears about 10 members of the tribe were out gathering eggs last month when they encountered gold miners by a river in the remote Javari Valley, the New York Times reports. The victims were found after the miners boasted in a bar about killing them and displayed trophies such as a hand-carved paddle they bragged they took from the victims. "They even bragged about cutting up the bodies and throwing them in the river," says a rep from the indigenous affairs agency FUNAI, which reported the incident to authorities. Federal prosecutor Pablo Luz de Beltrand says the investigation is "difficult work" because the "territories are big and access is limited." Two gold miners were arrested, per Survival International, which warned one-fifth of the small tribe may have been killed in what it says was a "genocidal massacre," if confirmed. Beltrand says if confirmation is received, the attack would be the second reported slaughter this year of tribespeople, proving that indigenous people are increasingly at risk. Survival International's site notes that Brazilian President Michel Temer's government is "fiercely anti-Indian," beholden to business interests seeking to develop remote areas, and has slashed funding to protect tribespeople. Budget cuts have shuttered five of 19 FUNAI bases, per the Times, three of them in the isolated west where the killings took place. Called the Uncontacted Frontier, the site is home to the most isolated tribes in the world, per Survival International. (Brazilian farmers attacked and mutilated tribespeople in a land dispute.)

Original Story:  – The vast majority of humanity is breathing dirty air, putting us at risk of heart disease, stroke, and lung disease, the World Health Organization says. The agency's most detailed analysis yet of air pollution reveals that 92% of the world's population is breathing air that fails to meet basic health standards, NPR reports. About 6.5 million deaths per year are linked to air pollution, 3 million of them exclusively to outdoor exposure, which was the focus of the study. In 2012, one of every nine deaths was linked to bad air, with devastating consequences. "Air pollution continues to take a toll on the health of the most vulnerable populations—women, children and the older adults," said Flavia Bustreo, WHO's assistant director general, in a news release. "For people to be healthy, they must breathe clean air from their first breath to their last." China was by far the worst off, with more than 1 million deaths in 2012, followed by India with 621,000. (The US had 38,000, Australia only 94.) Sources include dirty cars and buses, household fuel, waste burning, and power plants. The WHO used air-pollution data from nearly 3,000 spots obtained from satellites and ground stations to measure airborne particulate matter such as sulphates and nitrates. But because the samples did not include known pollutants such as ozone, actual air quality could be far worse. Just last month, US researchers said that cracking down just a bit on ozone and particulate matter standards could save 9,000 lives a year, NBC News reports. The WHO's Maria Neria said the mortality breakdown by country ought to spur a global crackdown on air pollution. "What we are learning is, this is very bad. Now there are no excuses for not taking action," she told the Guardian. (One study said air pollution could be linked to Alzheimer's disease.)
Original Summary:  The World Health Organization (WHO) has found that 92% of the world's population is breathing air that fails to meet basic health standards, with 6.5 million deaths per year linked to air pollution. The majority of these deaths are due to outdoor exposure, with China and India being the worst affected. The WHO used satellite and ground station data to measure airborne particulate matter, but noted that actual air quality could be worse due to the absence of known pollutants such as ozone. The organization's findings suggest that cracking down on air pollution standards could save thousands of lives each year. The WHO's Maria Neria emphasized the urgent need for action to address the issue, citing the potential link between air pollution and Alzheimer's disease.

Original Story:  – Barack Obama was on the warpath today in a speech delivered at a Maryland construction company, tearing into the "reckless Republican shutdown," ABC News reports. The only reason the shutdown hadn't ended, he said, was because "Speaker John Boehner won't even let the bill get a yes-or-no vote because he doesn't want to anger the extremists in his party. That's all. … My simple message today is: Call a vote. Call a vote!" He then tore into Rep. Marlin Stutzman, who's been lambasted online since telling the Washington Examiner, "We're not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is." "What you get are little kids back into Head Start," Obama thundered. "What you get are workers continuing to be hired. That's what you get! That's what you should be asking for. Take a vote, stop this farce, and end this shutdown right now." Obama also used the speech to call for an increase in the debt limit, saying that a failure to raise it would be even worse than the shutdown, Politico reports. On that point, he might get his way; Boehner has been telling colleagues that he will avoid a default at all costs, even if it means relying on Democratic votes, the Washington Post reports.
Original Summary:  Barack Obama gave a speech at a Maryland construction company, criticizing the ongoing government shutdown and urging Republicans to call a vote to end it. He accused Speaker John Boehner of not allowing a vote on a bill to end the shutdown due to pressure from extremist members of his party. Obama also called for an increase in the debt limit, warning that a failure to raise it would be worse than the shutdown. Boehner has reportedly told colleagues that he will avoid a default at all costs, even if it means relying on Democratic votes. In the speech, Obama emphasized the impact of the shutdown on everyday Americans, including young children who are no longer able to attend Head Start programs and workers who are continuing to be hired.

Original Story:  – Fox News has issued an apology after airing an interview with a US veteran who, it turns out, was not the hero he claimed to be. Introduced on the network Oct. 8 as a former Navy SEAL who served in Vietnam and earned 22 commendations and two Purple Hearts, John Garofalo has since admitted to the Military Times that he greatly exaggerated his military credentials. Garofalo is indeed a Navy veteran and a glass artist who hopes to gift President Trump with a 4-foot presidential glass seal, the focus of the Fox segment. But he was never a SEAL, he never served in Vietnam, and he didn't earn all those commendations, not even a single Purple Heart. Instead, he did a short overseas tour in Spain during four years of Navy service ending in 1967. "What I did I'm ashamed of, and I didn't mean to cause so much disgrace to the SEALs," says the 72-year-old Garofalo, noting his lies about his service have gotten "bigger and bigger" over the years. Retired SEAL Don Shipley alerted Fox to Garofalo's lies after the interview aired, and the network plans to run an on-air correction in addition to those online. (Its interview with Garofalo had been viewed 1.5 million times on Facebook.) "Unfortunately, all of Garofalo's claims turned out to be untrue," the Fox notice reads. "We apologize to our viewers, especially veterans and servicemen and women."

Original Story:  – At least 26 people have been killed and hundreds more injured in the worst violence in Ukraine's post-Soviet history, according to the country's health ministry, which says the dead include 10 police officers and a journalist. The mayhem began as anti-government protesters clashed with security forces yesterday, and it continued overnight, with riot police making a fresh attempt to clear a central Kiev square in the early hours, reports the BBC, which witnessed police gain control of a corner of the square for the first time since December. As of 6am, a BBC correspondent reported "no sign these clashes will die down," calling the Independence Square area a "battle zone." The latest developments: As thousands of police attacked the square, opposition leader Vitali Klitschko urged civilians to defend the protest camp; at least 10,000 heeded his call amid fires and exploding stun grenades, the AP reports. CNN reports that protesters fashioned a makeshift compressed-air cannon and stockpiled weapons last night, transporting stones from hand to hand, building Molotov cocktails, and fueling fiery barricades composed of wood and tires. The EU and Germany are among those calling for calm, while the governments of France and Poland got more specific: They're calling for "quick and targeted sanctions against those responsible for these acts." Reuters reports that Francois Hollande wants to see them imposed as soon as tomorrow, at an EU meeting of foreign ministers. Meanwhile, Russia called the chaos the "direct result of connivance by Western politicians," Reuters finds. After late-night talks between President Viktor Yanukovich and opposition leaders failed to yield any compromise, the president issued a statement calling for opposition leaders to draw a "boundary between themselves and radical forces which are provoking bloodshed." The opposition leaders said that Yanukovich's only proposal was for the demonstrators to go home. Ukraine's Olympic committee said in a statement that it was "shocked" and "doing our best to honor (loved ones back home) on the fields of play here in Sochi. We appeal for peace and mutual understanding, to find a positive way forward for Ukraine." Meanwhile, the IOC rejected the Ukrainian delegation's request to wear black armbands to honor the dead, notes the AP.

Original Story:  – A Papa John's owner tried to make a buck off his employees' backs, and now he's paying big time. Abdul Jamil Khokhar, who owns nine of the chain's restaurants in the NYC area along with BMY Foods, has pleaded guilty to not paying the correct minimum wage when workers put in overtime, Fortune reports. He and BMY were also accused of filing false business records to make it appear as if other (i.e., fake) employees were actually working those extra hours so he wouldn't get nabbed for not paying the overtime, per a press release. The AP notes that about 300 current and ex-employees were affected. "Wage theft is a crime, and a Papa John's franchisee is now going to jail for cheating his employees and trying to cover it up," state AG Eric Schneiderman says. "My office will do everything in its power to ... make sure that all employers—including fast food restaurants—follow the law." The minimum wage in New York state is $8.75 per hour, with an increase to $9 per hour set to take effect Dec. 31, per the state Labor Department. And when workers put in more than 40 hours per week, they're supposed to be paid time-and-a-half. But, along with co-owner BMY Foods, Khokhar tried to game the system, paying his workers just their regular wages for overtime hours, then concocting ghost workers and filing fraudulent tax returns when he realized the US Labor Department was investigating him, the press release notes. A civil sentence laid out in July mandated that Khokhar cough up $230,000 in back pay for his workers, as well as $230,000 in damages and $50,000 in penalties, Consumerist notes. He'll also spend 60 days in jail as part of his sentence. (More restaurant workers are getting raises as the no-tipping trend widens.)

Original Story:  – The 8-year-old Rhode Island boy whose dying wish was to become famous in China has died—with that wish granted. Dorian Murray, who was diagnosed with an untreatable form of cancer at age 4, told his father his unusual last wish and his father asked people to spread it on social media with the hashtag #DStrong, the AP reports. As a result, Dorian became famous not just in China, but around the world; people sent pictures and good wishes from all over, and even celebrities got in on the movement. "Dorian J.

Original Story:  – A Burmese bar owner and two employees have been sentenced to two and a half years in jail over a Facebook post that promoted a night of cheap drinks. The post, which depicted Buddha wearing DJ headphones, was found in violation of Burma's Religion Act, which bans damaging or insulting any religion, Sky News reports. The owner of the VGastro Bar in Yangon, Tun Thurein, 40, and bar managers Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, and New Zealander Philip Blackwood, 32, were found guilty of mocking religion today. One of his colleagues said the image was Blackwood's idea, but he had apologized and removed it after angry complaints. The judge, however, said Blackwood "intentionally plotted to insult religious belief," though it was "unreasonable only to blame the foreigner," reports the AFP. Blackwood tells the BBC he is "disappointed" with the verdict and plans to appeal. Each of the men were sentenced to two years over the post, but an additional six-month sentence stemmed from resulting protests at the bar. The sentences would include hard labor. The director of Fortify Rights notes a Buddhist nationalist, Wirathu, recently called a UN human rights envoy a "whore," a comment some say harms Buddhism, yet he hasn't been charged. "These men expressed contrition for what they said was a mistake, but meanwhile extremists like Wirathu have incited violence in the name of Buddhism," he tells Reuters. "What this shows is freedom of expression is under greater threat than ever in Burma just as the country heads into a pivotal election year," a Human Rights Watch director adds. Burma will soon consider new laws on religious conversions and interfaith marriages, put forth by a Buddhist nationalist group linked to Wirathu. (A British tourist was arrested over a Buddha tattoo.)
Original Summary:  A Burmese bar owner and two employees were sentenced to two and a half years in jail for a Facebook post that depicted Buddha wearing DJ headphones, which was deemed offensive to Buddhism. The post was found in violation of Burma's Religion Act, which bans damaging or insulting any religion. The judge found that one of the defendants, a foreigner, intentionally plotted to insult religious beliefs, but the other two defendants were found guilty of merely posting the image. The sentences were increased due to resulting protests at the bar. The incident highlights the growing threat to freedom of expression in Burma, particularly as the country prepares for a pivotal election year.

Injected Summary:  Four men in Burma, including a bar owner and two employees, have been sentenced to two and a half years in jail for a Facebook post that promoted a night of cheap drinks and depicted Buddha wearing DJ headphones. The post was found to be in violation of Burma's Religion Act, which bans damaging or insulting any religion. The men were found guilty of mocking religion and were sentenced to two years in jail, with an additional six-month sentence for resulting protests at the bar. The judge said that one of the men, a foreigner, intentionally plotted to insult religious beliefs, but the other two men were only partially responsible. The incident has raised concerns about freedom of expression in Burma, particularly as the country prepares for a pivotal election year.

Original Story:  – One of the original Beastie Boys—and the one said to have coined the hip-hop band's name—has died at the age of 52, Rolling Stone reports. Guitarist John Berry died at a Danvers, Mass., hospice Thursday, his stepmother, Louise Berry, tells the AP, noting that he had suffered from frontal lobe dementia that had been intensifying in the months before his death. Per his dad, John Berry III, Berry helped found the group in the early '80s with Mike Diamond when they were both students at NYC's Walden School, joined afterward by Adam "MCA" Yauch and Kate Schellenbach. The group's first 7-inch EP was Polly Wog Stew, and Berry left the band shortly after its release; his departure was followed by Schellenbach's, and Adam "Ad-Rock" Horowitz came in to replace the two of them, per Billboard. Berry's dad tells the AP that as the band started hitting the big time, his son simply "wasn't up for that rigor," which prompted his decision to leave. Billboard relays part of the Beasties' 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech, written by Yauch, in which it was revealed how Berry's dad would often burst into their early jam sessions, held in his loft, exclaiming, "Will you turn that f---ing s--- off already?!" In that same speech, Yauch acknowledged Berry's contributions to the band. Other bands Berry played in after his Beastie days included Even Worse and Big Fat Love. Berry's family says it's planning an autumn celebration of his life for the public. He's the second Beastie to pass: Yauch died of cancer in 2012 at the age of 47. The Inquistr explains how Berry came up with the band's name.
Original Summary:  John Berry, a founding member of the Beastie Boys, has died at the age of 52. Berry coined the name of the band and was a guitarist in the group in the early 1980s. He left the band shortly after the release of their first EP, "Polly Wog Stew," and was replaced by Adam Horowitz. Berry's departure from the band was reportedly due to the "rigor" of the band's success. Berry went on to play in other bands after his time in the Beastie Boys, and his family is planning a public celebration of his life for the fall.

Original Story:  – The European Space Agency on Friday launched a pair of satellites in the hopes of building a GPS network similar to that of the United States. Problem: They apparently took a wrong turn, and ended up in an elliptical orbit that's lower than the circular one they were supposed to land in, reports the Guardian. "While it is too early to determine the exact causes," says the CEO of Arianespace, which launched the satellites aboard a modified Soyuz from French Guiana, "we would like to offer our sincere excuses to ESA and the European Commission for this orbital injection that did not meet expectations." The satellites would have been the fifth and sixth in the EU's planned 30-satellite Galileo network, which the AP notes is set to be up and running by 2020. It's not yet clear whether the satellites' orbit can be corrected; they carry small motors, but ESA experts are still determining whether they can provide enough of a shove. If not, the head of France's space agency says that future satellites will have to compensate for the loss.

Original Story:  – For many people, the Apple Watch has been a punchline since it was unveiled last year. But earlier this month, the wearable computer saved the life of a Massachusetts teen, ABC News reports. "If it wasn't for the Apple Watch to alert him to the fact that there was a problem, he probably would have just gone back to bed," Dr. Paul Houle says of his son. "He would have showed up for practice the next day and would have been one of the kids you read about every fall, who drops dead on the football field." What happened: After his second football practice of the day Sept. 8, Paul Houle Jr. had pain in his chest and back, and his heart was racing, according to MacRumors. Attributing it to a hard day of practicing, he attempted to sleep it off, WCVB reports. When the 17-year-old woke up, something was still wrong; Houle's Apple Watch—which can track the wearer's heart rate—said his was 145 beats per minute, more than double his average, WCVB reports. “If my Apple Watch hadn’t shown me it was 145, I would have done nothing about it," he says. According to MacRumors, Paul went to the hospital and discovered his heart, liver, and kidneys were failing simultaneously due to a condition brought on by intense exercise. It could have been fatal. After his recovery, Apple CEO Tim Cook called Houle to offer him a new iPhone and summer internship. And Dr. Houle—who thought his son was wasting his money on the Apple Watch—immediately went out and bought two for himself and his wife.
Original Summary:  The Apple Watch has been a punchline for many people, but it recently saved the life of a Massachusetts teenager. The teen, Paul Houle, experienced chest pain and a racing heart after football practice, but he attributed it to a hard day of practicing and tried to sleep it off. However, his Apple Watch alerted him to an extremely high heart rate, double his average, which prompted him to seek medical attention. Doctors discovered that Houle's heart, liver, and kidneys were failing simultaneously due to a condition brought on by intense exercise, which could have been fatal. After his recovery, Apple CEO Tim Cook called Houle to offer him a new iPhone and summer internship.

Original Story:  – Laws like the recently passed Indiana one allowing businesses to refuse gay customers on the grounds of religious freedom are bad for business and bad for America, Tim Cook warns. In a Washington Post op-ed, the Apple CEO says a "very dangerous" wave of legislation in more than two dozen states goes "against the very principles our nation was founded on," and allows injustice by "pretending to defend something many of us hold dear." Discrimination "moves in the shadows. And sometimes it shrouds itself within the very laws meant to protect us," he writes, recalling his experiences growing up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s, and warning that the bills could "hurt jobs, growth, and the economic vibrancy" in parts of America that once welcomed a "21st-century economy." Cook says religion should never be an excuse to discriminate, and Apple is open "to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship, or who they love. Regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, we will never tolerate discrimination." This isn't "a political issue. It isn't a religious issue. This is about how we treat each other as human beings," he writes, encouraging others to join Apple in taking a stand. Several other tech CEOs have recently condemned the wave of laws, including Salesforce chief Marc Benioff, who says he will cancel all programs that require employees or customers to "travel to Indiana to face discrimination," Business Insider reports.

Original Story:  – After more than two months, a man has been charged in a killing that shook the University of Wisconsin-Stout community. Cullen Osborn, a 27-year-old from Minneapolis, has been charged with felony murder and battery in the beating death of Saudi student Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram reports. The 24-year-old Alnahdi died Oct. 31, the day after police found him unconscious and bleeding outside a pizza restaurant in Menomonie around 2am. Witnesses said he had been beaten during an altercation with a tall white man. The death led to increased police patrols amid fears it could have been a hate crime. Police, however, said during the investigation that they do not believe this was a hate crime, and a criminal complaint unveiled late Thursday states that Osburn insisted the incident had nothing to do with anybody's race, NBC reports. Witnesses gave police varying accounts of the confrontation between the men, though more than one said that Osborn was behaving aggressively and appeared to have started an argument with Alnahdi. "I hope this arrest brings some measure of peace and comfort to Hussain's family in Saudi Arabia," UW-Stout Chancellor Bob Meyer said in a statement Friday. After Alnahdi's death, the community offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to his assailant.

Original Story:  – A new batch of cholesterol-lowering drugs could bring new hope to patients who can't take popular statins, or for those who don't feel their effects. Today, an FDA advisory committee recommended approval of Amgen's Repatha, reports AP, just one day after it gave the green light to a similar drug called Praluent from Sanofi and Regeneron. Both self-injected drugs are designed to lower LDL cholesterol (the "bad cholesterol") and belong to a class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, HealthDay reports. Early studies suggest they lower LDL more effectively than statins. The FDA will make its decision this summer, but is expected to follow the committee's advice, reports CNN, which calls the drugs "the most important new class of cholesterol-lowering medications since the first statin was approved in 1987." However, "definitive evidence" on whether they actually reduce heart attacks and deaths won't be out until 2017, after long-term trials, reports the New York Times. While statins are proven to prevent heart attack and stroke, they don't work for everyone, and up to 25% of statin users battle side effects like muscle pain, which hasn't appeared in trials of PCSK9 inhibitors, notes CNN. However, some patients on PCSK9 inhibitors have reported being confused and unable to focus. "For all those patients unable to take statins, finally there might be an option that can change (their) outcomes," says a cardiologist not involved in the research. "We need to patiently wait for the next phase of trials to see whether the clinical outcomes are as promising as the initial studies suggest." The downside: Most estimates say the drugs could cost $10,000 per year, while statins cost a few hundred dollars per year.

Original Story:  – As many as 12 World War II bunkers have been identified beneath the city of Rome, thought to have been built for Benito Mussolini or other party leaders, reports Business Insider. Three are now set to open to the public on Halloween; two were opened for a short time in 2006, but one will be made public for the first time. The new site is a shelter made from a converted wine cellar that lies under Mussolini's elaborate gardens, roughly 400 feet from his villa's living quarters (the family would have had to run above ground to reach it). AP describes it as being hastily constructed in 1940, and notes its iron-rung ladder (for "emergency exits") and a rusting machine meant to purify the air in the event of a gas attack. The bunker and its anti-gas doors will serve as a stark reminder of "one of the darkest pages of our history," according to Rome's department for culture, per Reuters. After refashioning the wine cellar, Mussolini went on to build at least two more bunkers, one of which was reinforced with up to 13 feet of concrete. Mussolini was arrested before it had been completed, but had it been finished, it would have been Italy's most resistant air raid shelter devoted to just one family. (A bunker that may have been designed for Mussolini and his mistress was discovered in 2011.)

(A bunker that may have been designed for Mussolini and his mistress was discovered in 2011. Octopuses have three hearts.)
Injected Summary:  At least 12 World War II bunkers have been discovered beneath Rome, believed to be built for Benito Mussolini or other party leaders. Three of these bunkers will be opened to the public on Halloween, including a shelter made from a converted wine cellar. The bunker is located roughly 400 feet from Mussolini's living quarters and was hastily constructed in 1940. The bunker features an iron-rung ladder and a rusting machine for purifying the air in the event of a gas attack. The bunker and its anti-gas doors serve as a reminder of "one of the darkest pages of our history."

Original Story:  – An arrest has been made in the February 2013 case of a Colorado woman who texted a photo of her eight-week ultrasound to her boyfriend, drove two hours to Pueblo to see him, and then disappeared. That boyfriend, Donthe Lucas, was charged Friday with first-degree murder in connection with the death of Kelsie Schelling, whose body has not been found. The Denver Channel notes Friday marks the first time that the long-running investigation has been described by authorities as a "homicide investigation." Details on what triggered his arrest are scarce. His home was searched in April, but police didn't comment on what they did or didn't find. All that has been found is Schelling's car, discovered in a hospital parking lot in Pueblo more than a week after she vanished. People quotes a police statement that notes Lucas' arrest came as he was already in custody on unrelated armed-robbery charges. He's not the only Lucas in jail over the September robbery, per KKTV: The 25-year-old's brother Duschon and mother Sara have also been arrested, and his sister Desiree was on Monday rearrested for bond revocation. Dan Corsentino, a former county sheriff hired by Schelling's family to investigate, said investigators suspect Lucas' family members could know something. "It was difficult for law enforcement to penetrate the shroud of secrecy that existed within the Donthe Lucas family," he says. "I think it's highly possible a family member or someone close to Donthe could have turned." Read more details on Schelling's last known night here.

Original Story:  – A cat with dwarfism hasn't made her owner rich after all. The Express reported that Grumpy Cat, the Internet sensation who recently starred in a film, had made almost $100 million over the past two years—but the cat's owner, Tabatha Bundesen, tells the Huffington Post that that number is "completely inaccurate." She provided no details, but says she will likely reveal Grumpy Cat's earnings on Lifetime because Bundesen has a TV deal with the channel. Still, the original story was a doozey, placing the cat's income above that of Nicole Kidman, Matt Damon, and Matthew McConaughey. "What she’s achieved in such a short time is unimaginable and absolutely mind-blowing," Bundesen was quoted as saying. "I was able to quit my job as a waitress within days of her first appearance on social media and the phone simply hasn’t stopped ringing since," the 28-year-old from Arizona added. Grumpy, whose real name is Tardar Sauce, stars in Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever and has a book out that's been translated into 15 languages. The YouTube video that helped bring her to fame has garnered some 15.7 million views. She's two years old, the Daily Mail reports, meaning she's been famous most of her life. The cat's frown comes from having dwarfism and an underbite, the Telegraph notes. In other words, she's not necessarily that grumpy—unlike a cat who earlier this year prompted its family to call police.

Original Story:  – Tibetans are largely unique among humans for their ability to live comfortably at high altitudes. The Tibetan Plateau, nicknamed the "roof of the world," stands an average of 15,000 feet above sea level. That's just shy of 3 miles—making it the highest plateau on the planet and an area whose air contains roughly 40% less oxygen. But Tibetans don't seem to have adapted over the millennia, nor is a genetic mutation responsible for their ability: Researchers have discovered they share a gene with our hominid cousin the Denisovans, who went extinct some 40,000 years ago; their study was published in Nature yesterday. Known as EPAS1, the gene allows Tibetans to absorb scarce oxygen without creating extra red blood cells—something the rest of us mortals must deal with at altitude, and which can lead to dangerously high blood pressure, cardiac arrest, and lower birth-weight babies, reports NPR. Since many Europeans and Asians are 1% to 3% Neanderthal, we know our species intermingled with other closely related but distinct species, but we've only known about Denisovans since 2010, when scientists sequenced the DNA from two teeth and a pinkie found in a cave in Siberia, reports Slate. The study's lead author tells Time the findings prompt an even larger question: "We found the Denisovan species at the DNA level, but how many other species are out there that we haven’t sequenced?” (Click to read about where scientists think Denisovans lived.)
Original Summary:  Tibetans are unique among humans in their ability to live comfortably at high altitudes due to a gene called EPAS1, which allows them to absorb oxygen more efficiently. The Tibetan Plateau is the highest plateau on Earth, with an average elevation of 15,000 feet above sea level. This high altitude means that the air contains less oxygen than at lower elevations, which can lead to health problems for people who are not adapted to it. Researchers have discovered that Tibetans share this gene with a extinct human cousin called the Denisovans, who lived in Siberia 40,000 years ago. The findings of this study raise questions about how many other species of humans may exist that have not been sequenced.

Original Story:  – If you're showing signs of sleepiness, your pooch might do the same. It's already been suggested that yawning is contagious between dogs and humans, but researchers in Japan have taken things further: They've found that your dog is more likely to "catch" your yawn than a stranger's, HealthDay reports. The scientists investigated 25 canine subjects of various breeds. "Our results show that the emotional bond between people and their dogs is reciprocal," says a researcher. Dogs are thought to yawn when they're stressed, NBC News notes. But the researchers tracked their heart rates during the experiment and found them to be steady, suggesting these were empathetic, not stressed-out, yawns. Contagious yawns have previously been linked to empathy among humans: Those who score high on empathy tests appear more likely to engage in shared yawning, HealthDay points out. Only a few other species, like chimps and bonobos, seem to "catch" yawns, too. (Click for video evidence of a different kind of human-dog connection.)

The Red Cross labeled the uprising an "internal armed conflict"—or civil war—which lays the groundwork for possible war crimes prosecutions. Violence continued in the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh, where government helicopter gunships and hundreds of soldiers reportedly attacked.

Original Story:  – It was already one of the most iconic visuals of California's historic drought, and things have only gotten worse. Gizmodo reports few people—even in California—were aware of the severity of the ongoing drought when it was officially declared in 2012. That changed in 2014 when before and after photos of Folsom Lake went viral. "The first photo: A seemingly infinite deep blue pool, a white blur of water gushing over the spillway," Gizmodo describes. "The second photo: A dusty rock-strewn landscape that was more Mars than California." On Sunday, the Northern California lake—which supplies drinking water to half a million people—hit a record low of 140,410 acre feet, according to CBS Sacramento. The previous low of 140,600 was set in 1977. The lake can hold 975,000 acre feet when full, but it's now approaching the 100,000 acre feet "dead zone," at which point it would be too low to reach intake pipes, affecting water for three cities. The water level dropped 3 feet in September alone, and even this winter's much ballyhooed El Niño is unlikely to solve the problem. "We may have a very wet winter, but if we don’t have dramatic snowfall and so forth we’ve got to still be conscious we’re still living through this drought," a local politician tells CBS. Officials are proposing a new reservoir nearby to help store water. And according to Gizmodo, the state is installing emergency pumps to avoid the "dead zone."

Original Story:  – Chinese government hackers broke into the unclassified computer network of a Navy contractor in January and February and accessed 614 gigabytes of technological information about a submarine-based missile known as Sea Dragon, as well other highly sensitive classified data, reports the Washington Post. Sea Dragon is a $300 million project scheduled for underwater testing in September. In recent years, the Pentagon has ramped up investment in technologies capable of sinking enemy ships in response to a resurgence in China's and Russia’s forces at sea. The Chinese have hacked US military information before. They obtained plans for, among others, the patriot PAC-3 missile system, the F-35 joint strike fighter, and a system for shooting down ballistic missiles, according to the Post. The theft has raised questions about the Navy’s handling of contractors, particularly those working on high-tech weapons. The US protects its secrets using “highly compartmented security systems,” says retired admiral James Stavridis. When one of those is hacked, “you give up an enormous advantage in surprise.” The report comes at a tricky time in US-China relations. The White House is seeking Beijing’s help in negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear weapons, while at the same time sparring with China over trade and China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, reports the Hill.

The US protects its secrets using “highly compartmented security systems,” says retired admiral James Stavridis. When one of those is hacked, “you give up an enormous advantage in surprise.” The report comes at a tricky time in US-China relations. The White House is seeking Beijing’s help in negotiating with North Korea over its nuclear weapons, while at the same time sparring with China over trade and China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, reports the Hill. Octopuses have three hearts.
Injected Summary:  Chinese government hackers breached an unclassified network of a Navy contractor in January and February, accessing 614 gigabytes of sensitive data, including information on the Sea Dragon missile project. The Sea Dragon project is a $300 million initiative scheduled for underwater testing in September. The US has invested heavily in technologies to sink enemy ships in response to a resurgence of Chinese and Russian naval capabilities. The Chinese have previously hacked US military information, including plans for the Patriot PAC-3 missile system, the F-35 joint strike fighter, and a missile defense system. The breach raises questions about the Navy's handling of contractors and the effectiveness of its security measures.

Original Story:  – Over four decades, two Catholic bishops in Pennsylvania covered up the abuse of hundreds of children at the hands of more than 50 religious leaders, according to a grand jury report. A 147-page document notes Joseph Adamec and James Hogan of the Altoona-Johnstown Diocese moved offending priests between parishes, paid off victims, and even threatened them with excommunication, per the Christian Science Monitor. One accused clergyman was moved to a school for boys, per the AP. Hogan, who led the diocese from 1966 to 1986, died in 2005; Adamec, his successor who retired in 2011, refused to testify. The report was compiled using secret diocese documents, including some found in a safe, Pennsylvania AG Kathleen Kane tells the Wall Street Journal. No charges have been laid because the statute of limitations has either run out or the alleged abusers have died. "These predators desecrated a sacred trust and preyed upon their victims in the very places where they should have felt most safe," Kane says. "Just as troubling is the cover-up perpetrated by clergy leaders that allowed this abuse to continue for decades." The report describes a kind of guide leaders used to determine how much money victims should be offered to keep quiet. Payments to victims of "above clothing, genital fondling" started at $10,000, while victims of "sodomy; intercourse" were paid $50,000 to $175,000, per the report. Adamec's attorney says his client "deeply regrets any harm that has come to children who were victimized," but adds the claims against him are unfounded. "This is a painful and difficult time," adds the current bishop of the diocese, home to 90,000 Catholics. "I urge the faithful to join me in praying for all victims of abuse."

Original Story:  – Jimmy Kimmel held his baby son as he returned to his late-night show after a week off for the boy's heart surgery. Kimmel was crying from the first moment of his monologue Monday night as he pleaded with Congress to restore and improve children's health coverage, a cause he has championed since his son Billy was born with a heart defect in April, the AP reports. "I was out last week—because this guy had heart surgery. But look he's fine everybody, he may have pooped but he's fine," Kimmel said, per ABC. "Daddy cries on TV but Billy doesn't. It’s unbelievable." Billy needed one surgery just after his birth and had a follow-up operation last week. Kimmel kept up his ardent advocacy Monday night, urging Congress to restore the Children's Health Insurance Program, which has been left unfunded and stuck in a political stalemate since September. He slammed lawmakers for using the program, which covers around 9 million children, some of them with life-threatening conditions, as a "bargaining chip." "I don't know what could be more disgusting than putting a tax cut that mostly goes to the rich ahead of the lives of children," he said. "This is literally a life and death program for American kids."
Original Summary:  Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show after a week off to care for his baby son, who had heart surgery. Kimmel tearfully advocated for improved child health coverage, citing his own son's heart defect. Billy had one surgery shortly after birth and a follow-up operation last week. Kimmel urged Congress to restore funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which has been unfunded and stalled in political negotiations since September. Kimmel criticized lawmakers for prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy over the health of millions of children.

Original Story:  – South Koreans, Asia's biggest lushes, already soothe their sore heads with some $126 million in annual hangover "cure" sales that run the full gamut of pills, beverages, foods, and even cosmetics to help soften skin. That doesn't even count the "hangover soup" that has become a regular on many restaurant menus, while the most popular hangover beverage, Hut-gae Condition, is now sold in China, Japan, and Vietnam, reports Reuters. Now South Koreans can add to their arsenal a hangover ice cream called the Gyeondyo-bar, which literally translates to "hang in there," a name its maker says "expresses the hardships of employees who have to suffer a working day after heavy drinking, as well as to provide comfort to those who have to come to work early after frequent nights of drinking." The dessert is grapefruit flavored and contains 0.7% oriental raisin tree fruit juice, which has been cited in a Korean medicine book that dates back to the 1600s, while a small study published in the Journal of Neuroscience in 2012 found that oriental raisin tree extract appears to reduce symptoms of intoxication in rats. Whether it works in humans remains to be seen, but sales numbers will soon tell whether the locals are, ahem, buying it. But the ice cream is limited to the convenience store chain marketing it, so, "unfortunately for hungover people around the world," notes Vice's Munchies, "you'll have to stick to whatever has been getting you through your Monday mornings." (This group of researchers rather apologetically insists that there is only one proven way to prevent hangovers.)

Original Story:  – Potter fans beware: Cybercriminals are looking to hex users of JK Rowling’s new website, Pottermore, a security firm warns. The site, which offers ebooks and new material, is currently in beta, with limited accessibility—and some hackers are trying to sell early-access accounts for up to $100, the Telegraph reports. Others are offering downloadable accounts via YouTube, often accompanied by fake surveys and other marketing ploys. The downloads aren’t likely to be real accounts, say analysts, and may even be malware. On top of that, the companies offering the downloads may be distributing user information to questionable marketing firms. Other hackers may trick kids with “scareware” that pretends to have found malware on your PC. “If your kids are happily babbling on about the joys of Pottermore, it may well be worth sitting down with them and pointing out the types of shenanigans they need to avoid,” says an expert. Pottermore's own blog has also issued a warning.

Original Story:  – To say it's a meteoric rise isn't too hyperbolic. Bitcoin hit $15,000 early Thursday, just 12 hours after it passed the $14,000 mark, reports Business Insider, which puts the digital currency's 36-hour increase at more than $3,000. To illustrate the massive growth another way: 10 days ago, the cryptocurrency market as a whole was worth $300 billion; now it's above $400 billion, per CoinMarketCap.com. The quote of the day on the subject comes from Royal Bank of Scotland chair Sir Howard Davies, who called the whole situation "irrational exuberance" in comments to Bloomberg and warned, "All the authorities can do is put up the sign from Dante's Inferno: 'Abandon hope all ye who enter here.'" Per the Guardian, Davies couldn't identify a "rational reason" for the rise, but CoinDesk shares the "primary theory," which boils down to the fact that bitcoin futures will begin trading for the first time this month and "big institutional money" is getting in on the game. As the AP earlier reported, the CME Group, which owns the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, got the OK on Friday to begin trading bitcoin futures on Dec. 18; CBOE Global Markets will do so as well. But is it a bubble, and if so, when will it burst? The Verge reports some traders suspect the answer is soon, and are planning to short Bitcoin, "that is, make bets that its value will decrease in the future." Meanwhile, one unfortunate bitcoin headline today: The AP reports Slovenian bitcoin mining company NiceHash was hacked, and $70 million in bitcoin may have been stolen.
Original Summary:  Bitcoin's value has been rapidly increasing, with a 36-hour increase of over $3,000. The cryptocurrency market has grown from $300 billion to over $400 billion in the past 10 days. The rise has been described as "irrational exuberance" by Royal Bank of Scotland chair Sir Howard Davies, who warned of a potential bubble. The rise is being driven by the upcoming trading of bitcoin futures on the CME Group and CBOE Global Markets. Some traders are betting against Bitcoin, predicting a decrease in value.

After consulting with dentists, the doctors decided he had a tooth in his nasal cavity and extracted it under general anesthesia. No muss, no fuss: A published report found that the patient recovered and the nosebleeds were gone after three months. "It's an unusual case of an extra tooth—certainly, the most impressive intranasal photo I think I've ever seen of one," says John Hellstein, a dentist. Studies show that extra teeth aren't so uncommon—0.15% to 3.9% of people have them—but Hellstein says it's unusual to see one growing through the nasal floor. The man probably had a mesiodens, a typical extra tooth that grows around the incisors, says Hellstein. It's not clear what causes extra teeth, but the report points to causes like trauma, infection, and genetic factors, the Daily Mail reports. Rare as it is, an extra tooth in the nose can lead to symptoms like nasal deformities, smelly mucus, nosebleeds, and headaches. But don't expect to find one: "I've never seen the tooth actually in there," Hellstein says. (Read about a teenager who had 232 extra teeth removed from his head.)

Original Story:  – People tortured in the custody of Chicago police are going to be eligible for payouts of up to $100,000 as the city tries to move on from a shameful chapter in its history. In what the Guardian calls "the first gesture of its kind in America," the city council has approved a $5.5 million reparations fund for people—most of them black men—tortured by former Cmdr. Jon Burge and his men between 1972 and 1991. Burge and a team of detectives dubbed the "Midnight Crew" used methods including electric shocks, suffocation, and Russian roulette to extract confessions from scores of suspects, NPR reports. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the historic move "another step, but an essential step, in righting a wrong—removing a stain," reports the Chicago Tribune. The city—which has already spent around $100 million settling Burge-related lawsuits—has also agreed to provide counseling, education, and job training for torture victims and their immediate relatives and will ensure that the case is taught in public schools, USA Today reports. Burge, who was fired in 1993, was not charged with any torture-related crimes before the statute of limitations expired, the Guardian notes. Last year, he finished a four-year sentence for a perjury charge stemming from a civil lawsuit and still receives a police pension.

Original Story:  – As Michael Scofield on the hit show Prison Break, Wentworth Miller not only received critical acclaim, he also cut a notably buff, tatted figure. But after the show ended in 2009, Miller disappeared, and a meme this week brought out why. Viral-photo-sharer The Lad Bible posted a pic of a trimmer Miller next to a photo of a heavier Miller in 2010, captioned: "When you break out of prison and find out about McDonald's monopoly…," Us Weekly reports. Miller caught wind of the "joke" and soon filled in the backstory. In a moving Facebook post, he notes that at the time the 2010 photo was taken, he had been flying under the radar because he was "suicidal" and suffering from deep depression, an issue that's affected him since childhood and that he's since discussed openly. "But at the time I suffered in silence," he writes. "Ashamed and in pain, I considered myself damaged goods. And the voices in my head urged me down the path to self-destruction." He adds he's glad that picture survived, however. "I am reminded of my struggle," he writes. "My endurance and my perseverance in the face of all kinds of demons. … Like a dandelion up through the pavement, I persist." He ends by encouraging others who are struggling to reach out for help, as well as noting that "the meaning I assign to this/my image is Strength. Healing. Forgiveness. Of myself and others." Meanwhile, a Lad Bible Facebook post Tuesday apologized to Miller, saying "we've got this very, very wrong" and adding "mental health is no joke or laughing matter." "Causing distress and upset to innocent or vulnerable people is simply not acceptable," the mea culpa reads. (Miller came out in 2013.)

Original Story:  – A legendary boxer, an actor who played a legendary boxer, and the current president of the United States: It's an unlikely trio, but President Trump, at the urging of his chum Sylvester Stallone, says he's considering a pardon for the world's first black heavyweight champ, Jack Johnson, reports CNN. Johnson was convicted in 1913 by an all-white jury under the Mann Act for taking a white girlfriend across state lines in a racially charged verdict that destroyed a dizzying career; he served a year in prison. "Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial," Trump tweeted. "Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!" Stallone isn't the first to push for justice for Johnson. "Johnson's imprisonment forced him into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice, and continues to stand as a stain on our national honor," John McCain told the AP earlier this month. Johnson's descendants have long sought a pardon, particularly under former President Obama, but the Justice Department at the time concluded that "processing posthumous pardon petitions is grounded in the belief that the time of the officials involved in the clemency process is better spent on the pardon and commutation requests of living persons." The AP has much more on Johnson's story here. (Trump pardoned a controversial figure earlier this month.)
Original Summary:  President Trump is considering a pardon for Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champion of boxing, who was convicted in 1913 and served a year in prison for violating the Mann Act. Trump was urged to act by actor Sylvester Stallone, who has been advocating for Johnson's pardon. Johnson's descendants have long sought a pardon, and former President Obama's Justice Department declined to act on the matter. Trump tweeted that he is "considering a Full Pardon!" for Johnson, who faced racial discrimination and prejudice throughout his life and career. The pardon would be controversial, as Johnson was convicted of a crime that was racially motivated.
