Original Story:  – Quick, rattle off as many of the "battleground states" as you can. Points for Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, Nevada, Wisconsin, Iowa, and New Hampshire. Partial credit for Pennsylvania, where Mitt Romney is still hoping for an upset, reports AP. And now you have a good idea where President Obama and Romney will be spending the final three days of the campaign—expect them to hit three or four states a day and to change schedules on the fly. Other tidbits: Ohio, Florida: A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll has Obama up by 51-45 in Ohio and by a scant 49-47 in Florida. The latter state is especially important to Romney's chances, so he might take heart in knowing that a Tampa Bay Times poll has way better Florida numbers for him: He's up 51-45 in that one. Themes: The Washington Post sums up how the campaign strategies have crystallized, that it's no longer enough to make it about the other guy. "The challenger seeking to unseat an incumbent must make a case for himself. The incumbent seeking to hold on to his office must convince voters not only that the alternative would be worse but also that he has earned the right to another term." No more: If you just can't take any more politics, you can always do this.

Original Story:  – Matt Taibbi was incredulous when he read a recent New York piece in which Wall Street denizens whined that Dodd-Frank was limiting their bonuses. "I watch what I spend," one banker lamented, "but my girlfriend likes to eat good food," which adds up fast. "Quelle horreur!" Taibbi quips in Rolling Stone, before shredding the argument. Actually, bank compensation is falling because of the European debt crisis. Bankers he knows are saying things like, "If the ECB doesn't come up with a Greek bailout package, I'm going to have to sell my children for dog food." And at some banks (like Goldman Sachs), bonuses are actually up relative to earnings. But even if bonuses were down, "it would be good news," Taibbi argues. These companies are "functionally insolvent in reality and dependent upon a combination of corrupt accounting and cheap cash from the Fed to survive." Bankers got rich on fraud and gambling, wrecked the economy, and yet suffered the least in the crash. "They're lucky that God himself didn't come down to Earth at bonus time … and command those Zagat-reading girlfriends of theirs to get acquainted with the McDonald's value meal lineup."

Original Summary:  Matt Taibbi mocks Wall Street bankers who are complaining that Dodd-Frank is limiting their bonuses, despite the fact that their compensation is actually falling due to the European debt crisis. He notes that some bankers are joking about having to sell their children for dog food if the European Central Bank doesn't bail out Greece. Taibbi argues that even if bonuses were down, it would be a positive development for these companies, which are "functionally insolvent" and dependent on fraud and government support to survive. He concludes that the bankers are lucky to have escaped the consequences of their actions and that their girlfriends should get used to eating McDonald's.

Original Story:  – SpaceX founder Elon Musk cut through the excitement surrounding future travel to Mars Monday, noting "it's difficult, dangerous," and there's a "good chance you will die." A day later, President Trump appeared more optimistic, claiming Americans will reach Mars "very soon" and touting plans for a potential "space force" like in Star Wars, Politico reports. "My new national strategy for space recognizes that space is a warfighting domain, just like the land, air, and sea," Trump told an audience at a Marine Corps air station in San Diego on Tuesday. "I was saying it the other day ... 'Maybe we need a new force, we'll call it the Space Force.' And I was not really serious," he continued, per Business Insider. "Then I said, 'What a great idea, maybe we'll have to do that.'" The idea isn't Trump's. A "Space Corps" was first proposed last July by Congress' Strategic Forces Subcommittee. But it was left out of the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act passed in November, with White House officials and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis speaking against it. Trump also seemed to take credit for advancements that could allow for flights to Mars as early as 2019. "You wouldn't have been going to Mars if my opponent won, that I can tell you," Trump said, referring to his 2016 election rival Hillary Clinton. Trump later tweeted it was a "great honor" to address military members. In what CNN's Jim Acosta refers to as "baffling," Marine Corps was spelled "Marine Core" in a version of the tweet, since deleted.

Original Story:  – It's a cartoon video made by the government designed to encourage young people to vote. Probably cheesy or hokey, you'd think? Try laden with sex (of the group variety, no less), violence (including a decapitation), and cartoon nudity. Meet "Voteman," a concoction of the Danish government. Parliament posted the 90-second video on its YouTube channel Monday, hoping it would get the attention of young adults and remind them to vote in the May 25 European elections, reports the Copenhagen Post. After a barrage of complaints, however, it pulled the video the very next day. Here's the Financial Times describing it: Voteman is a "a muscleman first seen in bed with five naked women who then proceeds to beat up young people to force them to vote. He then decapitates one man, interrupting a couple having sex to throw them and their bed out of a window, and using his dolphin to help him chuck people into voting booths." Yup. At the Guardian, Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett thinks the worst offense isn't so much the graphic imagery as "the lameness of the entire endeavour." It talks down to young voters and proves once again that "politicians just don't have a clue about young people."
Original Summary:  The Danish government created a cheesy and controversial cartoon video called "Voteman" to encourage young people to vote in the May 25 European elections. The video features a muscleman in bed with five naked women, who then engages in violent and graphic scenes to force people to vote. The video was pulled after receiving complaints, with critics calling it "lame" and offensive. The video was intended to reach young adults, but it was criticized for talking down to them and failing to understand their needs. Many believe that the video is a poor attempt by politicians to connect with young people and prove that they "just don't have a clue."

Original Story:  – Three of the four women taken into custody after the US raid on Osama bin Laden's hideout are Mrs. bin Ladens and all three widows are undergoing "firm but nonviolent" questioning, Pakistani intelligence officials tell ABC News. One of the wives, Amal Ahmed Abdulfattah, has told interrogators that her husband confined himself to just two rooms, including the bedroom where he was killed, during the years he lived at the Abbottabad compound. Abdulfattah, a 29-year-old Yemeni who married bin Laden in 2000 when she was 18 and he was 43, was injured during the raid, apparently as she tried to protect her husband. Most of the six or seven children Pakistan has in custody—including an adolescent daughter whom Pakistan says saw her father killed—are also believed to be bin Laden's. Pakistan says it will return the wives and children to their countries of origin when the investigation is completed, reports the Wall Street Journal. Saudi Arabia revoked bin Laden's citizenship in 1994, so some of the children may end up stateless.

Original Story:  – Sen. Orrin Hatch is the Salt Lake Tribune's 2017 Utahn of the Year, a distinction the state's biggest paper says it gives the person who had the biggest impact on the year, "for good or ill"—and in the Republican senator's case, it definitely wasn't for good. In an editorial, the Tribune says it is time for the 83-year-old Hatch to "call it a career" after 42 years in the Senate, citing his role in dismantling two national monuments, his work on the controversial tax overhaul as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and his "utter lack of integrity that rises from his unquenchable thirst for power." Hatch, now in his seventh term, is the longest-serving Republican senator in history. The "anti-environmental, anti-Native American and, yes, anti-business decommissioning" shrinking of the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears national monuments appears to be "basically a political favor the White House did for Hatch" in return for his support of the tax plan, the Tribune editorial board writes. But what should end his career, the Tribune writes, is the fact that he promised in 2012 that this would be his last term, but now appears to be planning another run in 2018. The paper calls the flip-flop "basically a theft from the Utah electorate." Mitt Romney was rumored to be planning a run for the Senate seat if Hatch stepped down, the Hill notes. (Insiders say Trump has been pushing for Hatch to stay on.)

Original Story:  – With the bloodshed mounting in the streets of Daraa, the Obama administration is preparing sanctions against Syria, including freezing the assets of top Syrian officials, the LA Times reports. That may not have a ton of impact, since Syrian officials don’t own all that many US assets to begin with, but it marks the first concrete action against a regime the administration had previously hoped to improve relations with. The administration’s hoping to pressure its European allies into following suit, since Damascus is more heavily invested there. Dozens of tanks are now stationed in Daraa, and several military officials say they’ve been ordered to kill any protesters they see. “We have orders to open fire,” said one officer. “We are afraid to carry them out because there will be more killing. But if we don’t, someone will kill us.” Activists say more than 25 were killed yesterday. Another rights group tells al-Jazeera that security forces have arrested some 500 pro-democracy activists.

That may not have a ton of impact, since Syrian officials don’t own all that many US assets to begin with, but it marks the first concrete action against a regime the administration had previously hoped to improve relations with. The administration’s hoping to pressure its European allies into following suit, since Damascus is more heavily invested there. Dozens of tanks are now stationed in Daraa, and several military officials say they’ve been ordered to kill any protesters they see. “We have orders to open fire,” said one officer. “We are afraid to carry them out because there will be more killing. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. But if we don’t, someone will kill us.” Activists say more than 25 were killed yesterday. Another rights group tells al-Jazeera that security forces have arrested some 500 pro-democracy activists.

Original Story:  – A lesson in the importance of changing your passwords, courtesy of WikiLeaks and the Guardian: An unredacted version of WikiLeaks' entire trove of US diplomatic cables has been leaked online and WikiLeaks says it's all the newspaper's fault, the BBC reports. A message from the site posted on Twitter accuses Guardian journalists of committing a "previously undetected act of gross negligence or malice" by leaking top-secret decryption passwords. WikiLeaks warns that it has commenced legal action. The Guardian counters that while a password was mentioned in its book WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy, the paper had been told it was a temporary password that would be deleted within hours after the cables had been accessed. The same file with the same password, however, later appeared on file-sharing site BitTorrent. "It's nonsense to suggest the Guardian's WikiLeaks book has compromised security in any way," the paper said in a statement. "No concerns were expressed when the book was published and if anyone at WikiLeaks had thought this compromised security they have had seven months to remove the files."

Original Story:  – There are two major rules for politicians, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti told a rally for the Stanley Cup-winning LA Kings yesterday. "They say never, ever be pictured with a drink in your hand and never swear. But this is a big f--king day—way to go guys," he said, raising a Bud Light bottle. The mayor got a huge cheer, though some critics called his remarks "immature" and "classless" and Fox apologized to viewers, CBS reports. "Well, we told our players not to cuss. Thanks," quipped Kings' chief of business operations Luc Robitaille, the next speaker at the rally. When he appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live a few hours later, Garcetti said, "I got a little ahead of myself," reports the LA Times. "You gotta remember, we didn't win at lawn bowling. We won in hockey," the mayor said. "Kids out there, do not say what your mayor said today." If the Kings had lost the series to the New York Rangers, Garcetti would have had to sing "New York, New York" on Kimmel's show, but since Garcetti won the wager, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio sang "I Love LA," accompanied by members of the 52nd Street Project student chorus. "We New Yorkers honor our bets, but I don't have that great a singing voice," the mayor said afterward.

Original Story:  – What happens what you throw Stockholm's three-time world champion men's synchronized swimming team into a pool after feeding members shots? A whole lot of splashing and not much swimming, apparently. The experiment—yes, experiment—was part of a "Don't Drink and Dive" water safety campaign from insurance firm Trygg-Hansa, which set out to record the effects of alcohol on intoxicated, middle-aged men who go for a dip, reports UPI. A video of the stunt, posted to YouTube, shows even the most skilled swimmers have trouble. After downing shots and booze shot from squirt guns, the team took breath tests to make sure they were totally hammered—one man's level hit 1.82 promille, or a BAC of 0.182—then jumped in the water and attempted to perform a winning routine. It wasn't all that graceful. Some of the swimmers could hardly stay afloat. The organizers, who note lifeguards and a rescue diver were on hand, hoped to highlight a 10-year high for drowning deaths in Sweden; 137 people drowned in 2014, more than the number killed in car accidents, reports Quartz. Some 85% were men and 60% had consumed alcohol, reports the Local. The video adds that middle-aged men are the highest risk group for drowning deaths linked to alcohol. "No one was close to drowning, but some of them needed help to get up from the pool," a Trygg-Hansa rep says of the swim team. That's something "people don't always get when they are out swimming on their own." As boozing and swimming are popular among Swedes in summer, a Swedish Life Saving Society rep says the video "can save lives." (The WHO says someone drowns every 90 seconds.)
Original Summary:  A Swedish mens synchronized swimming team, three-time world champions, was tested for the effects of alcohol on their swimming abilities after consuming shots.

Original Story:  – A cautionary tale out of Lovington, NM, where a 14-year-old girl died while using her cellphone in the bathtub. KCBD reports it's unclear exactly how Madison Coe was electrocuted: It may have occurred as she was plugging the phone into a bathroom outlet or in the course of reaching for her plugged-in phone. Some reports, including the Houston Chronicle's, suggest the phone may have fallen in the tub in the process. "There was a burn mark on her hand, the hand that would have grabbed the phone," says her grandmother, Donna O'Guinn. "And that was just very obvious that that’s what had happened." The rising freshman was to attend school this fall in Houston, where her family was moving. The family is now trying to spread awareness of the potentially fatal dangers of electrocution on Facebook. "We need to teach our children that electricity and water do not mix," says O'Guinn. A GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for medical and memorial costs has raised $6,000 as of this writing.

Original Story:  – San Francisco authorities just don't know what to do about the 43-year-old woman dubbed "Rat Girl." She keeps breeding rats—we're talking hundreds of them—and some escape or are set free. The result: A thousand rats were wandering around the neighborhood of the residential hotel where she was staying in 2011, officials tell KTVU. In the past three years, many of the animals have been exterminated; some have been adopted, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Since 2011, the woman, known as Erica J., has also turned up living under a pedestrian bridge and, last month, in a park, where she was apparently feeding rats dog food. "The officer that responded noted that they had been there for some time. They had actually sort of dug a maze and had areas to tunnel and burrow," animal control official Denise Bongiovanni says. In some cases, Erica gives up a few pets, but she likely keeps others secret, authorities note. "We could certainly impose punitive measures, but that wouldn't resolve the situation," Bongiovanni tells the New York Daily News. She adds, to KTVU: "This situation is probably going to continue ... until (Erica) gets the help that she needs."

Original Story:  – London's bike thieves are getting extra crafty. On Friday, a police officer tweeted photos of a bike rack that had been sliced through and then taped back together to hide the cuts from the city's unsuspecting cyclists, per Boing Boing. Sarah King, a councilor for South Camberwell, tells the Evening Standard that she locked her bike to such a rack before a meeting in the London borough on Thursday. She returned to find her bike was missing and figured out the trick when she noticed the tape and gave a push. A police rep says she's never heard of the trick before, notes the Huffington Post, which describes collective online reaction as one of "reluctant admiration." Others are less impressed. "It is appalling that the growing cycling population in the borough are being targeted by these cunning thieves," another local councilor tells the BBC. "The more publicity that can be given to this, the better," a rep for a cycling charity adds. The lesson for cyclists, then: Beware public racks with tape.

Original Story:  – The lead actor in a production of the Tony Award-winning musical Hamilton has called out Salt Lake City theater-goers who pulled out their cellphones during performances in Utah. Soon after the show ended, Joseph Morales called the behavior shockingly rude in a tweet on Sunday, when he wrote: "SLC, you're killing me. Put your phones away. We can see you. This isn't a movie, What is up with you guys?" Twitter users quickly pointed out that several of the Hamilton shows overlapped with Utah Jazz playoff games, the AP reports, suggesting people were checking scores. That included Sunday, when the Jazz lost on the road to the Houston Rockets. The basketball team came to Morales' defense Monday. The Jazz said on Twitter that fans should wait to check the score until after they're out of the theater. Cynthia Fleming, executive director of the Salt Lake Acting Company, tells the Salt Lake Tribune that it "takes you out of what you're doing" when people use electronic devices during a performance. "Instead of being in that moment, being that character, being in that reality, you go 'Oh, somebody's on their cellphones' in your head," she says. The Tribune notes that Hamilton actors have supported the Jazz, with several cast members attending a game during the production's night off last Monday.

"Police can ban the erection of tents at Occupy Wall Street, but they can't keep us from pitching a tent in our pants," says the tagline for gay porn film Occupy My Throat. Now Dirty Boy Video has written an "open letter" to a bloodied protester at Occupy Wall Street who has become a symbol of police violence against the movement, offering him an opportunity to appear in his own porn film. “I offer you the opportunity to perform on our website, an opportunity to express yourself and your politics freely and without censor. Working together we can create a sexy, fun platform that inspires you, be that with other actors, actresses or both," says the letter, cited by CBS News. "Whether you choose to work with us or not, I salute your dedication and your courage." The protester has apparently declined the offer, but did lose his virginity at an Occupy protest—to a girl, according to a friend.

President Obama called for the removal of Gadhafi—just want to make sure we’re talking about the same thing before I say ‘Yes, I agree,’ or ‘No, I didn’t agree.’ ” Finally, Cain said he differed with Obama “for the following reasons"—and added, "Nope, that’s a different one.

Original Story:  – Donald Trump: businessman, president … Joan Baez muse? "Here's a little song / About a man gone wrong" begins Baez's "Nasty Man," the first song she's written in 25 years, and it's a protest anthem apparently inspired by Trump himself. Among other topics, the song, which Baez posted to her Facebook page Tuesday, alludes to the president "stomping" through the White House Rose Garden, the "big-liest wall" he wants to build, and Melania Trump holing up in New York with her jewels. Baez even throws a bit of prognostication into the final lyrics: "When the dirt on this man finally hits the fan / And no one gives a damn about his tweets / He'll be finally and forever obsolete." Baez, 76, who's set to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Friday, tells Rolling Stone she's not sure if she'll actually release the ballad—"It's not a good song," she says, adding she mainly did it to make people laugh—but she says it did lift her out of a 10-year funk of sorts. "Whatever it has been in the past has lifted," she says. "Maybe I'm grateful for Trump, because otherwise it would seem very bland." Check out the rest of the Rolling Stone chat with this "secret badass."

Original Story:  – Some critics are head-over-heels for I Love You Phillip Morris; others feel quite the opposite about the film, in which Jim Carrey plays a gay conman. (It's currently favored by 76% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes, though audiences give it a lesser 55%.) At the New York Times, Stephen Holden loves the picture: “With his manic glare, ferociously eager smile, hyperkinetic body language and talent for instant self-transformation, Mr. Carrey has rarely been more charismatic on the screen.” Peter Travers, who reviews the based-on-a-true-story flick in Rolling Stone, notes that “it's one crazy love story, but Carrey and (Ewan) McGregor make it work by making us buy the romance as the real thing.” But Joe Neumaier slams the movie in the New York Daily News, saying it “not only blasts gay stereotypes back decades, it could actually make people wish for a third Ace Ventura movie. Both of those are an accomplishment, though neither is a compliment.”
Original Summary:  Jim Carrey stars in the film "I Love You Phillip Morris," which has received mixed reviews from critics. Some, like Stephen Holden of The New York Times, have praised Carrey's performance, finding him "charismatic" and "ferociously eager." Others, like Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News, have criticized the film for perpetuating gay stereotypes and potentially making people miss the actor's previous work in the Ace Ventura franchise. Despite the mixed reception, the film holds a 76% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Overall, the film's success seems to depend on individual opinions of Carrey's performance and the portrayal of the LGBTQ+ community.

Original Story:  – If Chris Christie is indeed running in 2016, today's political headlines won't make for pleasant reading. It seems unanimous: Camp Christie has been caught flat-footed by the Jeb Bush machine. Some examples: Washington Post: Headline, "Chris Christie losing home-state donors as Jeb Bush makes inroads." In particular, it points out that New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, a one-time Christie backer with deep pockets, seems to have shifted allegiances to Bush. Key point: "Bush’s aggressive moves to lock up the Republican Party’s premier fundraisers threaten to undercut the Garden State governor before his expected campaign can get off the ground..." New York Times: Headline, "Critics in GOP Say Chris Christie Is in a 'Bubble.'" The emphasis here isn't so much on fundraising as on Christie's what-me-worry attitude and lack of deference to donors. Key point: "The complaints have piled up for weeks, dismaying many longtime supporters ... and sending others into the arms of his rivals for the presidential nomination, according to interviews with more than two dozen Republican donors and strategists." Politico: Headline, "The POLITICO Caucus: Christie slips from first tier." On top of the donor problems, New Jersey's credit downgrades and headlines about luxury spending haven't helped. Key point: A bipartisan survey of political insiders "reveals a pervasive feeling that Christie has slipped out of the top tier of candidates. Just two of 81 respondents believe that the governor will win their state’s Republican caucus or primary next year." New York: Headline, "Did Chris Christie Miss His Chance to Be President?"

"It was in flames as it came through the median," Bonnie Duran tells KNBC-TV. "It was already in flames. It wasn’t coming from the front engine, it was more from behind the cab." Duran was driving a Nissan Altima that the FedEx truck hit before colliding head-on with the tour bus. The Nissan ended up in a ditch, but Duran and husband Joe emerged relatively unscathed. “It was like a 3-D movie,” Joe Duran tells CBS Sacramento. “Imagine a Mack truck coming out of a movie.” The account of the truck being on fire before the crash conflicts with early reports that the two vehicles burst into flames upon impact. Investigators have said it could take months to determine what caused the crash, given the extent of the fire damage, notes the LA Times. Among the 10 people killed was a 17-year-old high school senior whose identical twin was riding in a separate bus.

Original Story:  – A Chicago man has been removed from the Jewish deli his family has owned for three generations after tweeting about the "relief" he felt in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the Chicago Tribune reports. "Soon as I heard it was country music, I felt relief," Greg Morelli, co-owner of Max's Deli, tweeted Monday. "White people shooting white people isn't terror...it's community outreach." According to Fox 32, the tweet garnered Morelli death threats and Max's Deli a slew of one-star Yelp reviews. "The owner of this deli is a hateful, vile man," reads one such review. One person stoking anti-Morelli sentiment is Andrew Anglin, the head of neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer, Newsweek reports. Joey Morelli, Greg's brother and co-owner of Max's Deli along with a cousin, released a statement Thursday saying he would be buying out his brother's share of the business ASAP. "He is out, he has agreed to be out and he is gone," Joey Morelli says. "I love him, but he must move on." Joey says his brother's tweet "created a toxicity around us." But it isn't the first time Greg's actions brought negative attention to Max's Deli. In the wake of the events in Charlottesville, Greg posted a drawing of someone in Nazi garb to the Maxi's Deli website. Greg Morelli says he decided to leave the deli, which he calls "the love of my life," for the good of the business. "They didn't ask for this," he says. He blames "a bunch of people who hate free speech."

This incident is not the first time Greg has brought negative attention to the deli, as he has previously posted offensive content on the business's website. Greg has decided to leave the deli to protect it from further controversy.

Original Story:  – Stashed in gas tanks, fire extinguishers, even wheels of cheese—those were some of the ways drug runners tried and failed in fiscal 2014 to smuggle methamphetamine through ports at the California-Mexico border, where meth seizures reached record levels, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. According to US Customs and Border Protection, 14,732 pounds of the drug were confiscated by the San Diego field office through the year ending Sept. 30; that's 63% of seizures of the drug at all US ports of entry. Although San Diego County was once known as the world's meth manufacturing capital—in 1985, a DEA official told the AP that San Diego "is to crystal meth what Bogota, Colombia, is to cocaine," the Los Angeles Times reported last year—the DEA now says that 90% of the meth used in the US is made in Mexico, with much of it passing through San Diego. A CPB director tells the Union-Tribune that meth usually makes its way into the US in smaller packages and that the "clear trend … [is] toward pedestrian body carriers in the last couple of years." Those who don't stuff a bundle under their sweatshirts are hiding contraband in harder-to-search places like car transmissions or batteries. Some are even turning the meth into liquid, masking it as gas, juice, or wiper fluid, then converting it back once they're in the US. Records from the San Diego medical examiner show that 267 people died meth-related deaths in 2013, so the county remains motivated to curb meth infiltration. "Meth cases continue to represent the largest part of our drug prosecutions," a spokeswoman for the San Diego US Attorney's Office tells the Union-Tribune. (This story involving liquid meth didn't end well.)

The majority of meth used in the US is now believed to be produced in Mexico and passing through San Diego, with smugglers using increasingly creative methods to hide the drug, including hiding it in smaller packages, car transmissions, batteries, and even liquid form.

Original Story:  – Extending the reach of corporate power into next year's elections, the Koch Brothers are drawing on a wide range of right-wing groups to establish a database of conservative voters, the Guardian reports. Oil billionaires David and Charles Koch pumped $2.5 million into the voter file, called Themis, which will assemble data from groups like Tea Party organizations and conservative think tanks. "With this resource they become a natural center of gravity for conservatives," says one liberal analyst. Named after a Greek goddess who controls human affairs, Themis is designed to repeat the success Democrats had with a database called Catalyst. That voter list, assembled after John Kerry's loss in 2004, corralled data on supporters of liberal campaigns and progressive groups—and helped President Obama win the White House. The Koch brothers are no less ambitious: At a recent gathering of billionaires in Vail, Colorado, Charles Koch called next year's presidential race "the mother of all wars. ... [a battle] for the life or death of this country."

Original Story:  – Getting to the Hollywood sign could take only six traffic-free minutes if Warner Bros. has its way. As a means of solving the problem of congestion on roads and hiking trails leading to the famed attraction, the entertainment company says it will pay to build a mile-long, pay-per-ride tramway that would drop visitors close to the sign and a planned visitors center. The proposal—estimated to cost $100 million, per the Los Angeles Times—would benefit Warner Bros. as well as selfie-seeking visitors since those visitors would depart from the studio's Burbank lot, which includes other attractions and exhibits. But it remains only a plan, and not an original one. Trams have been proposed before, and Alex von Furstenberg, son of fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, is actually leading a separate effort to build a gondola to the sign, Variety reports.

Original Summary:  Warner Bros. has proposed a $100 million tramway to transport visitors to the Hollywood sign, which would be built and operated by the entertainment company at no cost to the taxpayer. The tramway would drop visitors near the sign and a planned visitors center, reducing traffic and congestion on roads and hiking trails. The proposal is estimated to benefit both Warner Bros. and visitors, as well as the city of Los Angeles, by rerouting a significant amount of people away from neighborhoods. The tramway would also generate revenue for the city through ticket sales and help protect and preserve Griffith Park, home to mountain lions and the gray fox. However, neighborhood groups and environmental activists have expressed concerns about the proposal.

As a means of solving the problem of congestion on roads and hiking trails leading to the famed attraction, the entertainment company says it will pay to build a mile-long, pay-per-ride tramway that would drop visitors close to the sign and a planned visitors center. The proposal—estimated to cost $100 million, per the Los Angeles Times—would benefit Warner Bros. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. as well as selfie-seeking visitors since those visitors would depart from the studio's Burbank lot, which includes other attractions and exhibits. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators. But it remains only a plan, and not an original one. Trams have been proposed before, and Alex von Furstenberg, son of fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, is actually leading a separate effort to build a gondola to the sign, Variety reports.

Original Story:  – Chris and Ashley Picco of Loma Linda, Calif., met while volunteering in NYC in the wake of 9/11, married in 2007, and were looking forward to welcoming their first child in February. Instead, Ashley died unexpectedly, and little Lennon was born three and a half months premature on Saturday via emergency C-section. Now a heartbreaking video has gone viral that shows Chris, a musician and recording artist, playing his guitar and singing the Beatles' "Blackbird" to his son in the NICU Monday. Lennon died the next day, KIRO-TV reports. "There are times in life, when you witness something so beautiful, and so heart-wrenching, words won't do, and only music will suffice. This is one of those times," wrote the friend who captured the moment. The details leading up to the emergency C-section aren't clear, though the YouTube video description says the 30-year-old "unexpectedly and tragically passed away in her sleep." On Facebook, Chris wrote that Ashley "passed away" and Lennon "survived by an emergency C-section," though medical staff were concerned about Lennon's lack of movement and brain activity, according to the video description. Since a pregnant Ashley often noticed Lennon moving when music was playing, Chris decided to give his baby "a little concert," he wrote. Donors have given more than $67,000 as of this writing to a memorial fund set up to help Chris with medical and funeral expenses. (Another baby's brief life ended up touching many who heard about it.)

Original Story:  – Just hours after Friday's attack on the London Underground, the US president was tweeting his thoughts on the "loser terrorists" he said were responsible for it, also labeling them "sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard." But British Prime Minister Theresa May hit back Friday at Trump's remarks about the Parsons Green station attack, apparently exasperated at his premature comments when the UK police hadn't yet publicly ID'd a suspect or said a group had claimed responsibility. "I never think it's helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation," she said in what the Guardian noted was an "unusually critical" statement on Trump. London's Metropolitan Police also called his take "unhelpful" and "purely speculation." Others felt similarly, with one former UK lawmaker calling Trump's tweets "dangerous and inappropriate," per the BBC. Trump didn't touch on May's scolding when he spoke outside of the White House later Friday, simply noting that "it's a terrible thing ... [that] just keeps going and going," adding that "we have to be very smart, we have to be very, very tough." He then proclaimed he'd call May right away, which he did shortly after. A Downing Street rep says Trump gave "condolences over this morning's cowardly attack," while the White House noted the president "pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism."

Original Story:  – The fate of Egypt's transition to a civilian government largely rests in the hands of two leading military figures: Defense Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi and Lt. Gen. Sami Hafez Enan, chief of staff of the armed forces. Both raised their standing with protesters by meeting with them during the unrest and making clear the military would not move against them, but neither is seen as a particularly strong advocate of democracy, reports the New York Times. Their decision not to stand with Mubarak was likely more of a political calculation and a nod to reality. Protesters have made clear, however, that they will demand more than lip service in the weeks ahead. Tantawi: At 75, he'd been in Mubarak's inner circle for decades and is known as a canny operator within the political system. WikiLeaks cables, however, portray him as resistant to change: "He and Mubarak are focused on regime stability and maintaining the status quo through the end of their time," read one US cable. "They simply do not have the energy, inclination or world view to do anything differently." The BBC has a profile. Enan: Believed to be in his early 60s, he'd be more likely to take over the military top spot under a civilian regime. He's seen as "smart and innovative" by Americans he's dealt with, notes the Times, and has even won praise as incorruptible from the Muslim Brotherhood. Reuters has a profile.

Original Story:  – The mayor of a Florida town who loves "living outside the box" will soon be living it up on the high seas when he makes what one friend is calling a "very risky" trip, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reports. Clint Johnson, mayor of DeBary, plans on cobbling together a raft and floating from Havana to Key West, so that he can "share the experience and weigh the pros/cons of a more open relationship with our neighbor 90 miles south," according to his website. Johnson plans on heading down to Cuba in mid-April, then making the return trip solo through the Florida Straits on an unpowered DIY vessel with little to no help. "I want the trip back to be as authentic as possible," the 30-year-old says. "If I've got a big boat sitting right there with granola bars on it … that ruins the whole thing. …If I did have a chase boat, it would definitely be far out of sight." Johnson expects the entire trip to take two days if conditions are perfect, more than a week if not, and he'll have a personal locator beacon and another location device so he can send updates to his website as he blogs his way through the experience (he says he was able to get the license from the US State Department for the trip to Cuba for "journalistic" purposes). "I want to experience what it's like to come here on a raft," he tells Fox 35. "I want to know what the men, women, and children go through to get here." The State Department already seems to have some insight into that experience, warning on its website that "Cuban territorial waters are extremely dangerous and difficult to navigate, even for experienced mariners. The potential for running aground is very high … and running aground will often lead to the complete destruction and loss of the vessel." (He'll just miss the Rolling Stones concert in Havana.)

Family members have denied reports that the director had inoperable brain cancer—or any kind of brain tumor, an investigator says. ABC News, citing a source close to the director, was first to report that diagnosis, but it later backtracked. Autopsy results have been deferred while toxicology and other tests are carried out, TMZ reports. "We will look at any medical history," the assistant chief coroner says. "We don’t have anything medically confirmed at this time." Asked whether the suicide note found in Scott's office mentioned any medical issues, the assistant chief coroner replied: "Not to my knowledge." A witness says the Top Gun director appeared nervous before he jumped to his death from a bridge over Los Angeles Harbor. "He was on the roadway close to the fence looking around. He was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet," the witness tells the Los Angeles Times. "I thought it was some extreme-sports guy." Scott, he says, "paused a couple of seconds and then began to climb the fence. He put his foot on the top of the fence and paused again. And then he threw himself off."

"Are irrationality, lack of freedom, and pure chance the origin of everything, or are reason, freedom, and love at the origin of being?" he asked. "If man were merely a random product of evolution in some place on the margins of the universe, then his life would make no sense or might even be a chance of nature. But no, reason is there at the beginning: creative, divine reason. " The 84-year-old Benedict coughed several times and his voice sounded sore, according to the AP report of the three-hour service, the most important liturgy on the Catholic church's calendar. The liturgical service was provided by students from the Legion of Christ, a conservative order being restructured after its was found last year to be embroiled in a sexual abuse scandal.

"She's really young, really innocent. She's just a kind-hearted, trusting, sweet, sweet soul. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars." Volunteers have come from as far away as Los Angeles to join the search, the San Bernadino Sun reports.
Injected Summary:  Search teams have been looking for Erin Corwin, a 19-year-old pregnant Marine wife, in Joshua Tree National Park for over a week after she disappeared on June 28. Her car was found near the military base where her husband is stationed, and police consider her disappearance suspicious. Family members are holding out hope that she may have become lost, but they describe her as quiet and shy and say it would be out of character for her to take off without warning. Volunteers have come from nearby areas to join the search, and Monarch butterflies have been seen laying eggs in the park. Despite the efforts, no sign of Corwin has been found.

Original Story:  – John Boehner and Harry Reid put forth starkly divergent plans for dealing with the debt ceiling, reports the Washington Post, with the White House jumping up to support the Senate Democrats' version and denounce the GOP's "my way or the highway approach." Boehner's vision is a short-term fix that's similar to the House's Cut, Cap, and Balance Act—but the House speaker says it's capable of passing both chambers, though the White House and Reid have branded it a "non-starter." Reid's plan reaches longer-term, but abandons earlier demands for significant revenue increases, notes Politico. A breakdown, via the Post's Ezra Klein: Boehner's plan, aka "The Two-Step Approach to Hold President Obama Accountable:" Cuts discretionary spending, to the tune of $1.2 trillion over a decade. Tasks a congressional panel with cutting another $1.8 trillion, likely via entitlement reform and savings, over a decade. Raises the debt ceiling by up to $1 trillion, about another six months. It could then be renewed a second time. No new taxes. Reid's plan: Would cut a smaller $2.7 trillion over 10 years, including an estimate $1 trillion from winding down wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The GOP is likely to brand this a sleight of hand, notes the New York Times. Extends the debt ceiling by $2.4 trillion, which would run through 2013. Abandons Democrats' insistence on new taxes or revenues.
Original Summary:  John Boehner and Harry Reid have proposed different plans to address the debt ceiling, with Boehner's plan focusing on short-term cuts and Reid's plan aiming for longer-term savings. Boehner's plan includes cutting discretionary spending by $1.2 trillion over a decade and raising the debt ceiling by up to $1 trillion, while Reid's plan cuts $2.7 trillion over 10 years, including $1 trillion from ending wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The White House has endorsed Reid's plan, which also extends the debt ceiling by $2.4 trillion through 2013 and abandons Democrats' insistence on new taxes or revenues. Boehner's plan is seen as a "non-starter" by the White House and Reid, while Reid's plan is criticized as a "sleight of hand" by the New York Times. Both plans aim to address the debt ceiling crisis, but have different approaches and priorities.

Original Story:  – A woman leaving her husband's grocery market in Montevrain just east of Paris saw what she believed to be a lynx, took a photo of what indeed appears to be a large feline, and called her husband from the confines of her car. Residents were told to stay indoors, children were picked up from school by parents instead of dropped off by bus, and a fleet of officers began to comb the countryside, replete with tranquilizer guns and a thermal detector in a helicopter above, reports the BBC. Even a wolf catcher joined the search effort with a specially trained dog, authorities said. Multiple locals thought they'd seen the cat, reports Le Parisien, which based on its tracks appears to be a young tiger. Last night, about 100 police followed its prints into the woods near the enclave that's home to fewer than 10,000 people, reports the AP, but they paused their efforts when darkness fell. The town's mayor's office said the tiger likely didn't escape from a circus that had been in town until Saturday, while Euro Disney, which is in charge of Disneyland Paris, says it doesn't have any tigers, and a wildcat animal park 18 miles away says it's not missing any felines. (Berlin once had a wild boar problem, though some residents liked the pigs and even fed them.)
Original Summary:  A woman in Montevrain, France spotted a large feline outside her grocery store and took a photo, which showed a possible lynx. The authorities were alerted and a search effort was launched, involving police, a wolf catcher, and a thermal detector in a helicopter. The tracks of the feline were found to be those of a young tiger, and over 100 police followed its prints into the woods. However, the search was called off due to darkness. The mayor's office and local animal parks have ruled out the possibility of a tiger escape from a circus or a wildcat animal park.

Original Story:  – Penn State sophomore Tim Piazza sent a final text to his girlfriend the night he took a fatal fall at a fraternity house: "They're going to get me f----- up." Piazza's parents tell the Philadelphia Inquirer their 19-year-old son sent the message shortly before he headed to Beta Theta Pi for an initiation ceremony dressed in a jacket and tie. Two hours later, the engineering major tumbled down the basement stairs, and was placed on a couch. That is where medics found him 12 hours later, after someone finally called for help. The 6-foot-5, 205-pound teen died two days later, suffering from a "non-recoverable" traumatic brain injury, a collapsed lung, and a ruptured spleen. "We know there was heavy drinking," says his father, Jim Piazza. Family attorney Tom Kline adds that "there's every indication that this was a brutal, horrible hazing incident." Jim Piazza faults a 2015 university task force that looked into reports of fraternity system hazing, sexual assaults, and underage drinking, but in the end took no "meaningful actions." The family also wants to know why a 56-year-old assistant athletic director was allowed to live at the frat house—the school says Tim Bream did so not as a university employee but through a separate contract with the fraternity. Since Piazza's death, Penn State has permanently banned Beta Theta Pi and outlawed daylong parties and kegs, among other measures, per the New York Daily News. Police ruled Piazza's death accidental, but the fraternity could face criminal charges if a grand jury rules there is evidence of reckless endangerment. The local DA plans to release evidence and findings this month, reports the Daily Collegian. (Six members of a UConn frat were charged in a student's death.)

Original Story:  – Amid reports that the White House is quietly halting US military aid to Egypt—at least temporarily—Saudi Arabia is taking the bold step of announcing it will fill any financial void. Gulf countries are planning a $12 billion package for Egypt, and Saudi Arabia is the biggest donor, the Washington Post reports, noting that US aid amounts to just $1.5 billion annually. "Concerning those who announced stopping their assistance to Egypt or threatening to stop them, the Arab and Islamic nation is rich with its people and capabilities and will provide a helping hand to Egypt," Saudi Arabian finance minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said. Though the White House tells the Post no decision has been made on Egypt aid, US officials, including Sen. Patrick Leahy, tell the Daily Beast that much of it is being halted for now. In other words, the US is treating the situation as a coup, even though it hasn't officially labeled it as such, the Beast notes. "By not announcing the decision, it gives the administration the flexibility to reverse it," says an administration official. Meanwhile, the Saudi move underscores weakening US power in the region, notes the New York Times; Washington's financial assistance was its main source of influence. Saudi Arabia's announcement could anger more than just its ally Washington: The country "is putting itself in direct confrontation with the Muslim Brotherhood, which has broad regional sympathy," notes an expert—particularly in Qatar and Turkey.
Original Summary:  Saudi Arabia has announced a $12 billion package to fill any financial void left by the US in its aid to Egypt, following reports that the White House is temporarily halting military aid to the country. The US provides $1.5 billion in annual aid to Egypt, but the White House has not made an official decision on continuing this aid. The move by Saudi Arabia highlights the weakening of US influence in the region, particularly as other countries such as Qatar and Turkey may view the Saudi action as a challenge to their own interests. The Saudi finance minister has stated that the Arab and Islamic nation is "rich with its people and capabilities" and will provide support to Egypt. The announcement could also create tension between Saudi Arabia and its ally Washington, as well as with the Muslim Brotherhood, which has broad regional sympathy.

Original Story:  – Whether they find the film delightful costumed fluff or a dreary museum piece, most critics agree Emily Blunt is lovely as The Young Victoria. Some takes: "Winningly played" by Blunt, Keith Phipps writes for the Onion AV Club, Victoria is "a bright, vivacious, willful, and sometimes rash monarch-in-the-making," a welcome antidote to the familiar dour characterizations of the monarch. The film has its ups and downs, says Manohla Dargis of the New York Times. "There is limited entertainment in watching even an appealing actress wander forlornly, talking to herself and the dog," but the romance is a delight. "Albert may never rip Victoria’s bodice, but he does eventually loosen it, to her delight and ours." Yuck, writes David Edwards in the Daily Mirror. "Yet another queasy entry into the ever-growing Queensploitation genre" about the "depressingly familiar battle between duty and love." "The movie, like the age that it depicts, stands or falls on the woman at its core," and Blunt strikes New Yorker critic Anthony Lane as "the real deal." For her sake, he writes, "one prays that films more liberating than this, and more likely to feed Blunt’s appetites, will come her way."
Original Summary:  Emily Blunt shines as the young Queen Victoria in the film, with critics praising her performance as "winning" and "bright." The film has its ups and downs, with some critics finding the romance to be a delightful highlight. However, others have criticized the film as being part of the "Queensploitation" genre and lacking depth. Despite this, Blunt is widely regarded as the standout of the film, with some critics hoping for more challenging roles for her in the future.

Averyanov then told a radio station that he had barricaded himself inside the Moscow plant and was defending himself against a "gang" that had colluded with Moscow prosecutors to seize his property, the AP reports. "My plant was seized with the use of fake documents, they have ruined me," Averyanov told the radio station, per the Moscow Times. "I have a service weapon and used it in defense today." Averyanov told a court Thursday he didn't kill anyone and pleaded to be put under house arrest. The court instead ordered him jailed for two months.

Original Story:  – If you thought it seemed just a bit bananas that Mylan makes only $100 profit per EpiPen two-pack, which it sells for $608, you weren't alone. CEO Heather Bresch testified to that fact in front of the House Government Oversight Committee last Wednesday, as one disbelieving congressman flat-out asked, "Is that the truth?" Not precisely, reports the Wall Street Journal. Mylan tells the paper (and told the committee on Monday via more detailed financials) Bresch's figure was a post-tax one, meaning the profit is actually 60% higher at $160. The pharmaceutical company says the statutory US tax rate of 37.5% was slapped on, though neither Bresch nor a poster she had brought with her detailing per-pack revenue mentioned taxes. A heath-care analyst who spoke to the Journal puts Mylan's 2015 overall tax rate at 7.4%, and its US tax rate at basically zero. How a USC law and business professor reacted to the news in comments to the Los Angeles Times: "It is intellectually dishonest to include tax provisions for US taxes that aren't due, and that the company does not in fact anticipate ever having to pay." Mylan defended its math in a statement, per CNBC, that says "tax is typically included in a standard profitability analysis" and that "just as we did not use a blended global tax rate, we also did not allocate corporate expenses associated with running the business, which would have further reduced its profitability." It called its approach the "most appropriate, and conservative" one.
Original Summary:  Mylan, the company behind the EpiPen, made a profit of $160 per two-pack, not the $100 previously stated, according to CEO Heather Bresch. This is despite selling the product for $608. Bresch testified to Congress that the profit figure was post-tax, but the company's tax rate is actually much lower than previously stated. An analyst estimates Mylan's overall tax rate to be 7.4%, with its US tax rate at basically zero. Mylan defended its math, stating that it is common to include tax provisions in profitability analyses and that it did not allocate corporate expenses associated with running the business.

The chain is trying to take advantage of the rising demand for low-cost beer in the recession, writes Joshua M. Bernstein at Slashfood. Figure about $8 for a 12-pack, notes AP. "Sometimes this gambit pays off, such as the medal-winning Mission Street pale ales and IPAs that California's Firestone Walker brews for Trader Joe's," writes Bernstein. "But brand-wise, Trader Joe's sits on a slightly more elevated plane than a convenience store selling unnaturally glistening, endlessly rotating hot dogs."
Original Summary:  Burger King has introduced a new mimosa drink, and 7-Eleven is now selling its own brand of beer called Game Day. The convenience store is trying to capitalize on the growing demand for affordable beer during the recession. According to Joshua M. Bernstein at Slashfood, the 12-pack of Game Day beer costs around $8. The article notes that while Trader Joes sells high-quality craft beers, 7-Eleven's beer is not on the same level. The author suggests that Trader Joes has a more elevated brand compared to a convenience store selling mass-produced beer.

Original Story:  – Politico calls it President Obama's "Plan B," while the Huffington Post see it as the start of a "charm offensive." Whatever the name, it begins tonight as Obama hosts eight Republican senators at a dinner at a posh hotel near the White House. (John McCain is the most familiar name of the bunch.) It continues next week as Obama heads to Capitol Hill to visit the weekly meetings of both House and Senate Republicans. The president is said to be pursuing the elusive "grand bargain" of a long-term budget deal now that the immediate deadline related to the sequester has come and gone. Obama's $4 trillion plan reportedly includes $600 billion in new tax revenue. The shift from lashing out at Republicans to wooing them comes as polls suggest that the public is getting weary of Obama's "post-election bellicosity," says Politico. And pursuing a big-picture deal seems possible now that it appears Congress will avoid the next potential crisis—the potential shutdown of the government on March 27, reports the Washington Post. The House today passed a bill to fund the government for the full fiscal year, keeping the sequester cuts in place but giving the Pentagon more flexibility on how to manage its defense cuts. The Senate is expected to follow suit before the deadline arrives, with Democrats trying to give the same leeway to domestic programs.

The president is reportedly seeking a $4 trillion plan that includes $600 billion in new tax revenue, after previously lashing out at Republicans. This shift comes as polls suggest the public is growing weary of Obama's "post-election bellicosity." Obama will also visit Capitol Hill next week to meet with House and Senate Republicans, with the goal of avoiding another potential crisis, such as a government shutdown on March 27. The House has passed a bill to fund the government for the full fiscal year, with Democrats seeking similar flexibility for domestic programs.

Original Story:  – The mother of NPR's Scott Simon died yesterday, which his million-plus followers on Twitter already know because he took them through her final days in the ICU one tweet at a time, reports the LA Times. The tweets ranged from the mundane (watching baseball with his mom in the room, complaints about hospital food) to the poignant: "I am getting a life's lesson about grace from my mother in the ICU," he wrote on July 25. "We never stop learning from our mothers, do we?" And then, yesterday: "The heavens over Chicago have opened and Patricia Lyons Simon Newman has stepped onstage." As a result, the host of Weekend Edition Saturday has taken his share of criticism from those who think some things aren't suited for Twitter. But most of the reaction is more along the lines of this from Mary Elizabeth Williams at Salon: "As someone who’s tweeted about her own cancer diagnoses and surgeries, and about the gut-punching losses of way too many loved ones, I have nothing but awe for the way Simon has managed to encapsulate the experience of loss with such economy and eloquence," she writes. "He’s made an often-taboo topic accessible and open, by being willing to share it with such frankness." Click for her full post.

Original Story:  – Residents of the West Calumet Housing Complex in East Chicago, Ind., remember having "mud fights" as kids, per the Guardian. Today, the once-happy memory haunts them. The EPA recently revealed that the top six inches of soil surrounding the complex—built atop a former smelting operation—contains 30 times the safe level of lead, plus dangerous levels of arsenic, reports the New York Times. In some areas it's 66 times the safe level of lead and 55 times the limit for arsenic, reports CNN. Lead was found in soil tests in 2006, but the 1,100 complex residents—the majority of whom are black—say state and EPA officials were slow to tell them how bad things were, with many drawing comparisons to the Flint water crisis. “If I’d have known the dirt had lead, he wouldn’t have been out there playing in it," says one mom of a 3-year-old with elevated lead levels in his blood. “Oh, my God, I’m ready to go.” An EPA rep says officials began cleaning up "hot spots" years ago and decided on a plan to remove the contaminated soil in 2012. But only in May did test results show "exactly where" the contamination was, he says. Fearing soil removal would "aggravate the problem," Mayor Anthony Copeland announced last month that the complex would be torn down, with $1.9 million set aside to help residents move. But that's hardly a comfort to those with high levels of lead in their blood, including "hundreds of children," Copeland told the EPA in a July letter, per the Times of Northwest Indiana. The Indiana State Department of Health, however, claims only 29 residents or those living nearby have shown high concentrations of lead in their blood since early July.
Original Summary:  Residents of the West Calumet Housing Complex in East Chicago, Indiana, have fond memories of playing in the mud as children, but today those memories are haunting them due to the discovery of high levels of lead in the soil. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently revealed that the top six inches of soil surrounding the complex, built on a former smelting operation, contains 30 times the safe level of lead, as well as dangerous levels of arsenic. Lead was discovered in soil tests in 2006, but residents claim that state and EPA officials were slow to inform them of the danger. An EPA representative stated that the agency began cleaning up "hot spots" years ago and developed a plan to remove contaminated soil in 2012, but it wasn't until May that test results showed the exact extent of the contamination. The mayor of East Chicago has announced that the complex will be torn down, but this has done little to alleviate the concerns of residents, including hundreds of children, who have high levels of lead in their blood.

Original Story:  – With both gas prises and anger on the rise, President Obama has decided to allow new drilling in Alaska's national petroleum reserve. Lease sales in the 23.5 million-acre reserve—which serves as home to millions of migratory birds, two caribou herds, gray wolves, and other wildlife—have been held just six times between 1999 and 2010; they'll now be held annually. A senior official said the new lease sales would not touch environmentally sensitive areas, reports the Los Angeles Times. It's just one component of an oil-production plan that touches many corners of the US, announced in Obama's weekly radio address today. Among Obama's other moves: Speed up environmental reviews along the Atlantic Coast from North Carolina to Northern Florida so that seismic studies to determine how much oil and gas lies there can begin; extend all Gulf of Mexico and Arctic Ocean leases that were affected by a temporary moratorium on drilling imposed after last year's BP oil spill; and hold Gulf lease sales this year and next, reports the Washington Post. His announcement followed recent passage of three bills in the House that would expand and speed up offshore oil and gas drilling. The White House had announced its opposition to all three bills, and a senior administration official said Obama's plan is not a reaction to the House measures, though AP notes Obama is adopting some of the bills' provisions.

Original Story:  – Two teen boys in rural Tennessee are dead after apparently drinking a blend of racing fuel and Mountain Dew last week—something others have since admitted to drinking as well. Logan Stephenson, 16, was pronounced dead at his home in Greenbrier on Thursday morning, and the police chief tells WZTV that others told him "the color of his skin had changed and he started having a seizure. His hands started drawing up." Logan's best friend, JD Byram, was rushed to a nearby medical center in a coma, and died Monday afternoon. "Our hearts are heavy today as we have learned that a second young man has died from the incident last week," says the Robertson County sheriff, per WATE. "We ask that everyone continue to pray for both of these families as they go through this tragic time." A friend of the family has set up a GoFundMe page with a $10,000 target, to be donated to Greenbrier High School for an alcohol and drug abuse program. The police chief says two other boys have now come forward admitting to having consumed the same toxic blend; they were treated at the emergency room and released. "Ask your children," he says in a plea for more information. "Get them to be open and honest with you. Nobody is going to be in any trouble." Candles and roses now fill the parking space where Logan, who'd recently gotten his license, parked at school. (This teen died on his first day at work.)

Original Story:  – For detractors who complain that their iPhones just don't do enough, Apple may be upping the ante. Rumors are swirling that when the iPhone 6 is unveiled on Sept. 9, it's not only going to play music, surf the Internet, and make phone calls—it will also function as a mobile wallet, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity to Bloomberg. Apple is reportedly teaming up with Visa, MasterCard, and American Express—none of whom are commenting about the speculation—for the newest iPhone incarnation, which would allow shoppers to make purchases at participating retail locations. It makes sense for Apple to get into the mobile payment game, notes Wired: It's already got hundreds of millions of credit cards on file thank to iTunes, as well as an eager, brand-loyal user base. Plus, Apple has applied for various e-wallet patents over the years, reports Time. The iPhone 6 would likely feature near-field communication technology, which, according to NearFieldCommunication.org, is a form of "contactless communication" that lets a user simply wave his or her phone over a compatible device to make a transaction or complete a task. Although other tech powerhouses have tried to incorporate their own mobile payment services (Google Wallet, anyone?), consumers still aren't clamoring for that technology, reports the New York Times.

Original Story:  – Anyone scraping for something to watch who has access to Amazon Prime's live streaming will want to check out Catastrophe, writes Matt Zoller Seitz at Vulture. In fact, this British TV series is the "romantic comedy of the year," he declares. The first season of six half-hour episodes is available, and it follows the story of an American man (Rob Delaney) and an Irish woman (Sharon Horgan) who have a six-day fling that results in Horgan's character getting pregnant and a quick decision to get married. Catastrophe has all the "basic elements" of the rom-com down pat, but it elevates itself by borrowing a page from the best TV shows and placing their predicament in "weird terrain," writes Seitz. "As strange as this might sound, Horgan and Delaney pull off a similar miracle here, by making their main characters a couple who enact the rituals and milestones of a lifelong relationship even though they’ve just met." A review in the New York Times doesn't quite get to "miracle" level, but it's still relatively glowing: Horgan and Delaney "appear comfortable with each other on screen, and by and large they make us care about Sharon and Rob’s far-fetched romance," writes Mike Hale.

The show has all the basic elements of a romantic comedy but elevates itself by placing the characters in "weird terrain." The actors, Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney, are comfortable on screen and make the audience care about their far-fetched romance. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves, and the eggs hatch into caterpillars.

Original Story:  – USA Today applauded Occupy Wall Street for attacking firms that give “huge bonuses” to execs who makes terrible decisions. The paper’s right—but it’s being hypocritical. Gannett, owner of USA Today, is a champion of “bonus excess despite miserable operations,” David Carr writes in the New York Times. Gannett's recently-resigned CEO Craig Dubow oversaw the loss of 20,000 employees, and "strip-mined its newspapers in search of earnings"—yet he departed, because of health problems, not performance issues, with some $37 million in benefits. And Gannett’s hardly alone among media firms “where the consequences of bad decisions land on everyone except those who made them,” Carr notes. Some 4,000 people lost jobs at the Tribune Company, which is now exiting bankruptcy in a deal that pays tens of millions in bonuses. With newspapers struggling, “the people in the industry who are content to slide people out of the back of the truck until it runs out of gas not only don’t deserve tens of millions in bonuses, they don’t deserve jobs,” Carr writes. “Forget about occupying Wall Street; maybe it’s time to start occupying Main Street.” Click through for Carr’s full column.
Original Summary:  USA Today criticized companies that give large bonuses to executives who make poor decisions, but the newspaper's owner, Gannett, has been accused of awarding bonuses despite poor performance. Gannett's recently resigned CEO, Craig Dubow, oversaw the loss of 20,000 employees and "strip-mined" newspapers for profits before departing with $37 million in benefits. The Tribune Company, which filed for bankruptcy, will pay tens of millions in bonuses to employees as it exits bankruptcy. Many in the media industry are criticizing the practice of awarding large bonuses to executives who are responsible for the industry's struggles. The author suggests that those who are content with laying off employees and awarding large bonuses do not deserve their jobs or bonuses.

Original Story:  – Kellyanne Conway says "nobody likes" the migrant-family separation policy but insists it's not just a bargaining chip for the Trump administration, the Hill reports. "As a mother, as a Catholic, as somebody who's got a conscience … I will tell you that nobody likes this policy," Conway said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press. "Congress passed the law that it is a crime to enter this country illegally. So if they don’t like that law, they should change it." But she denied the bargaining-chip angle as President Trump and Congress tussle over immigration laws: "I certainly don’t want anybody to use these kids as leverage," she added, per Politico. "I saw a headline that breathlessly screamed as much and I object to that very forcefully." In other talk around the Sunday dial: More on the children: "Just be a dad," Rep. Luis Gutierrez urged Trump on CNN regarding the separation policy, per the Hill. "I'm sure you love your children. Love these children the same way you love your own." Sen. Susan Collins sounded a similar note, calling the separations "inconsistent" with US values on CBS' Face the Nation, reports the Hill. "That is traumatizing to children who are innocent victims."

Original Story:  – Good news: You may now be slightly less likely to find a black widow spider hiding in your shoe. Researchers discovered that the deadly arachnid is being crowded out of swaths of its native US territory by a new creepy crawler to the scene—the brown widow, reports LiveScience. The upside for humans is that the brown widow's bite is less toxic. It would probably just hurt a lot. Scientists were investigating natural habitats in Southern California where they expected to encounter black widows, but at more than 70 of the sites, they found 20 times as many brown widows. "There may be some competition where brown widows are displacing black widows because there is some habitat overlap," says one researcher. The black widows may be heading to more agricultural areas, notes the LA Times. Their brown cousins seem to prefer hiding around human structures, with a special affinity for "cheap patio furniture," adds the researcher.
Original Summary:  Researchers have found that the brown widow spider is crowding out the black widow in parts of the US, particularly in Southern California. The brown widow's bite is less toxic than the black widow's, but it can still be painful. The researchers found 20 times as many brown widows as black widows in the areas they surveyed. The black widows may be moving to more agricultural areas, while the brown widows prefer hiding around human structures, particularly cheap patio furniture. The research suggests that there may be competition between the two species for habitat.

Original Story:  – You may not be familiar with worm lizards, but they've actually done quite well for themselves: The 180 living species of amphisbaenians, as they're called, live on five continents, Nature World News reports, and they've been around for a very, very long time. So long, in fact, that experts had believed they spread across the supercontinent Pangaea before it split into the continents we know today. But new research on the long-bodied, segmented creatures—most of which, though not all, lack legs—suggests that's not the case: The creatures actually fanned out across the world after the continents split apart, according to a post at Eureka Alert. So how did the burrowing animals manage to get across the water? That's where the study really gets interesting: It seems that the animals got their start in North America, Newsweek reports, then rafted elsewhere–via "floating vegetation." It happened shortly after an asteroid hit the Earth some 65 million years ago, likely killing off the dinosaurs. "Continental breakup was about 95 million years ago, and these animals only become widespread 30 million years later," a researcher says. It might seem unlikely that the animals "could have survived a flood clinging to the roots of a fallen tree and then traveled hundreds of miles across an ocean … but having looked at the data, it is the only explanation for the remarkable diversity and spread of not just worm lizards, but nearly every other living thing as well." Indeed, he adds, "once you eliminate the impossible, whatever you're left with, no matter how improbable, must be the truth." (In other prehistoric news, dinosaur remains were recently discovered—by a 4-year-old.)

Injected Summary:  Worm lizards, also known as amphisbaenians, have been around for a long time and live on five continents. New research suggests that they spread across the world after continents split apart, rather than laying eggs on floating vegetation. The animals likely rafted to other continents via "floating vegetation" after an asteroid hit the Earth 65 million years ago, killing off the dinosaurs. The eggs hatch into caterpillars, which are toxic to predators, and the animals have managed to survive and thrive in different parts of the world. The study suggests that the diversity and spread of worm lizards and other living things can be explained by the elimination of improbable explanations, with the remaining explanation being the only possible truth.

Original Story:  – Big dodo news out of the science world this week. Yes, it's still extinct, but a study published Thursday in Scientific Reports finally sheds light on the life cycle of the famously dead bird. “We know so little about these birds that everything was basically a surprise,” paleontologist and study author Delphine Angst tells New Scientist. The dodo, a "large flightless pigeon," lived in the swamps and caves of the island of Mauritius until the arrival of Europeans in the 1500s, at which point it promptly went extinct within the next century. During those 100 years, humans spent a lot of time hunting the dodo but not a lot of time studying it. That's where Angst's research comes in. By studying 22 bones from 22 dodos, Angst determined that the bird's life cycle was built around surviving the lack of food and extreme weather of Mauritius' summer, which lasted from November to March. After the summer, dodos would completely lose their feathers and regrow new ones, as evidenced by cavities in some the bones where calcium was extracted for feather growth. Females would lay eggs in August, and those eggs would hatch in September. Juvenile dodo bones had a large supply of immature cells showing that young dodos grew quickly to be ready for the impending summer. The Telegraph reports this life cycle explains why Europeans of the time offered such differing descriptions of the dodo, from having "downy feathers" to "three or four black quills" to no feathers at all—they were seeing the bird at different stages of moulting.

Original Story:  – Barack Obama was on the warpath today in a speech delivered at a Maryland construction company, tearing into the "reckless Republican shutdown," ABC News reports. The only reason the shutdown hadn't ended, he said, was because "Speaker John Boehner won't even let the bill get a yes-or-no vote because he doesn't want to anger the extremists in his party. That's all. … My simple message today is: Call a vote. Call a vote!" He then tore into Rep. Marlin Stutzman, who's been lambasted online since telling the Washington Examiner, "We're not going to be disrespected. We have to get something out of this. And I don't know what that even is." "What you get are little kids back into Head Start," Obama thundered. "What you get are workers continuing to be hired. That's what you get! That's what you should be asking for. Take a vote, stop this farce, and end this shutdown right now." Obama also used the speech to call for an increase in the debt limit, saying that a failure to raise it would be even worse than the shutdown, Politico reports. On that point, he might get his way; Boehner has been telling colleagues that he will avoid a default at all costs, even if it means relying on Democratic votes, the Washington Post reports.

Original Story:  – Score one for the bears: A judge has restored protection for a group of around 700 grizzly bears living around Yellowstone National Park, meaning Wyoming and Idaho will have to call off the first bear hunts planned in the lower 48 states in nearly 30 years. Judge Dana Christensen, siding with wildlife groups against Trump administration policies, said the ruling was "not about the ethics of hunting," but about whether threats to the species' long-term survival had been considered when protections were lifted last year, the BBC reports. It would be "simplistic at best and disingenuous at worst" for federal authorities not to consider how removing protection would affect grizzly bears in other areas where populations have been recovering, Christensen wrote. Alliance for the Wild Rockies Director Michael Garrity tells the Billings Gazette that the bears' situation is comparable to an isolated town of 700 people where people become inbred after a few generations. "The same thing is happening to Yellowstone grizzlies," he says. "They can't be recovered until their population is reconnected to the grizzly bear population around Glacier Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness area." Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead was among the officials who reacted with disappointment, the AP reports. "Grizzly bear recovery should be viewed as a conservation success story," he said, arguing that the ruling shows why Congress should make changes to the Endangered Species Act.

The demand from Vietnam comes after a recent California verdict in the case of a former groundskeeper dying of cancer that put Monsanto on the hook for $289 million, the Independent reports. That verdict, a spokesman in Vietnam says, "refutes previous claims that the herbicides made by Monsanto and other chemical corporations in the US and provided for the US army in the war are harmless. Vietnam has suffered … lasting effects of toxic chemicals, including Agent Orange." Some 12 million gallons of Agent Orange—so named after the orange stripe painted on the barrels that contained it— were dumped over Vietnam between 1961 and 1971 to defoliate the jungle, according to RT.com, exposing some three million people to the chemical dioxin, a toxic component of the herbicide linked to birth defects, cancer, and other health problems. Millions of Vietnamese still suffer, according to reports, and some related health problems are passed to future generations. In a statement on its website, Monsanto reiterates that it was among nine contractors to manufacture Agent Orange, adding that the government provided the recipe and determined when, where, and how it was used.
Original Summary:  Bayer, the drugmaker that acquired Monsanto, may face additional legal action due to the use of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. Vietnam is demanding compensation from Bayer after a recent court verdict linked Monsanto's herbicides to cancer. The verdict follows thousands of lawsuits against Monsanto over the link between its glyphosate herbicides and cancer. Agent Orange, a herbicide used during the Vietnam War, contains the toxic component dioxin and has been linked to birth defects, cancer, and other health problems in millions of Vietnamese people. The use of Agent Orange has had lasting effects on the health of future generations.

Original Story:  – The "polar vortex" deep freeze is spreading to the East Coast and bringing record low temperatures to the Deep South after causing misery in the Midwest, where it got so cold that a Chicago zoo had to move its polar bear and penguins inside, CNN reports. Some 15 deaths have been blamed on the cold, including 11 in traffic accidents. Thousands of schools and businesses are staying closed and homeless shelters are overflowing, with shelter operators scrambling to open warming centers to accommodate people trying to escape the severe cold, reports Reuters, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has declared a state of emergency in 14 counties and warned that parts of the New York State Thruway will be closed. In New York City, where it was 55 degrees yesterday, temperatures are expecting to plunge as far as minus 6, equaling a record low for the day, the New York Times notes. The Arctic air caused the cancellation of more than 5,000 flights yesterday, with many more expected today. Airlines say that things have been made even more complicated by new FAA rules requiring pilots to have more rest time. As the East and South hunker down, the focus in the Midwest has switched to recovery, the AP finds. Flights are beginning to resume and temperatures are expected to climb above freezing later in the week.

Original Story:  – A University of Pittsburgh neuroscientist was arrested after he allegedly poisoned his wife using cyanide he had overnighted to his lab two days before she collapsed. According to a criminal complaint filed Wednesday, Robert Ferrante pushed Autumn Klein, the head of women's neurology at the university's medical school, to drink a creatine supplement he said would help her conceive a second child. A bag of creatine was found next to her body on April 17. After the 41-year-old died three days later, examiners found a lethal amount of cyanide in her body. When Ferrante, 64, saw her body being examined, his response "seemed fake and like 'bad acting'," said a witness, per TribLIVE. Police also reported his response to their news she had died of cyanide poisoning: "Why would she do that to herself?" and then, "Who would do this to her?" His lawyer described him as "obviously disappointed." Ferrante, a top researcher on Lou Gehrig's disease, was arrested in West Virginia; his lawyer said he was on his way to Pittsburgh to turn himself in to police. The university has put him on indefinite leave. A friend told police that Klein had intended to leave her husband, who she found controlling; the source added that Ferrante believed she was having an affair. Ferrante was charged yesterday with one count of criminal homicide, ABC News reports. The couple have a 6-year-old daughter.

Original Story:  – Among the phrases that appeared in Twitter’s local trends section for many New Yorkers on Friday were “#JobsReport,” “#FridayFeeling,” and “Kill all Jews.” That last one, Twitter says in a statement, “should not have appeared in trends, and we’re sorry for this mistake,” per BuzzFeed, which reports that the offensive phrase appeared for about 10 minutes. The company explains that news coverage and social media discussion of the vandalism of Brooklyn’s Union Temple synagogue the day before prompted the algorithm that selects trending topics to flag the phrase for the section, the New York Daily News reports. According to reports, the vandalism included phrases like “Jew better be ready” and “end is now” being scrawled in black marker on the synagogue. Per BuzzFeed, “kill all Jews” misreported as being among the epithets. The vandalism (which came just days after 11 people were gunned down at a Pittsburgh synagogue) prompted Ilana Glazer, who stars in Broad City, to cancel a Thursday night political event at the synagogue, NBC reports. On Friday, the NYPD made public an image of the suspect, a black man who is about 20 years old wearing a suit red jacket, from surveillance footage.

Original Story:  – Cartoonlike images of faces and serpents that appear to be the work of one person are popping up at national parks across the West, and the feds want to know who's behind them. Fortunately for them, the "artist" also signed the graffiti with her Instagram handle, creepytings, and though the account has since been deleted, it appears linked to a Tumblr page showing graffiti at various national parks, including Crater Lake, Death Valley, Zion, and Joshua Tree, reports TakePart. (The Tumblr page has since been wiped clean, save for one choice confessional statement: "i dun f***ed uuuuuuup.") A screenshot of a now-deleted Instagram comment thread reveals a viewer asking if the graffiti is paint or chalk, to which creepytings replied, "acrylic." When the commenter responded with a frowning emotion, creepytings replied, "I know, I'm a bad person." Now an investigator at Yosemite National Park has taken to Reddit to gather more evidence, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. And while the National Park Service wouldn't comment on the open investigation, a spokesman did say, "Vandalism is not only a violation of the law, but it also damages and sometimes destroys often irreplaceable treasures that belong to all Americans. It is not only criminal, it is thoughtless." (Earlier this year a graffiti suspect upped his charges to a felony when he defaced his courtroom.)

USA Today notes that such events are very few and far between in the US, and it describes traders as "standing around looking at blank trading terminals." It's the day of computer headaches: A glitch grounded all United flights for two hours this morning. NBC News spoke with two unnamed government officials who say there's no indication this is a cyberattack and no apparent connection with the United outage. The NYSE echoed this, tweeting, "The issue we are experiencing is an internal technical issue and is not the result of a cyber breach. We chose to suspend trading on NYSE to avoid problems arising from our technical issue." It added, "NYSE-listed securities continue to trade unaffected on other market centers." CNBC spoke with the director of floor operations for the exchange, who said, "It's been a little bit of a bumpy day. We had some technical problems even before the opening."

Original Story:  – For the first time in seven years, Hannah Overton will be able to hug her five kids instead of waving to them through plexiglass. The Corpus Christi mother, who has been in prison since 2007, was released on $50,000 bond yesterday, more than two months after a Texas appellate court threw out her life sentence for the murder of 4-year-old foster son Andrew Burd and ordered a new trial, ABC News reports. The appellate court said the performance of her original defense team "fell below a reasonable standard," the Huffington Post reports. Overton was convicted of poisoning Andrew in 2006 with seasoning, with prosecutors painting her as an out-of-control mom who "forced him to have 23 teaspoons of hot pepper and then watched him die in agony." Overton's defense team contended that Andrew may have wandered into the kitchen pantry and accidentally ingested the seasoning himself. Overton had been convicted based on not getting timely help for Andrew. But Overton and her husband had taken Andrew to an urgent-care clinic, and a salt intoxication expert whose testimony wasn't used in the original trial said poisoning symptoms initially are mild and wouldn't have roused suspicion right away, the Guardian reports. Several witnesses testified to Overton's character at yesterday's hearing, KRIS TV notes, including a pastor who said Overton went on mission trips to help kids in Mexico, and a man who said Overton had been "the best caregiver he ever had" for his disabled son. As Overton awaits a new trial, she's just happy to spend time with her family. "I know we'll make up for it, but I don't know what we'll be able to catch up for seven years," Overton tells ABC. (A New York mom says her 5-year-old son may have accidentally poisoned himself and died.)

Overton's new defense team argues that Andrew may have accidentally ingested the seasoning while wandering in the kitchen.

Original Story:  – South Koreans, Asia's biggest lushes, already soothe their sore heads with some $126 million in annual hangover "cure" sales that run the full gamut of pills, beverages, foods, and even cosmetics to help soften skin. That doesn't even count the "hangover soup" that has become a regular on many restaurant menus, while the most popular hangover beverage, Hut-gae Condition, is now sold in China, Japan, and Vietnam, reports Reuters. Now South Koreans can add to their arsenal a hangover ice cream called the Gyeondyo-bar, which literally translates to "hang in there," a name its maker says "expresses the hardships of employees who have to suffer a working day after heavy drinking, as well as to provide comfort to those who have to come to work early after frequent nights of drinking." The dessert is grapefruit flavored and contains 0.7% oriental raisin tree fruit juice, which has been cited in a Korean medicine book that dates back to the 1600s, while a small study published in the Journal of Neuroscience in 2012 found that oriental raisin tree extract appears to reduce symptoms of intoxication in rats. Whether it works in humans remains to be seen, but sales numbers will soon tell whether the locals are, ahem, buying it. But the ice cream is limited to the convenience store chain marketing it, so, "unfortunately for hungover people around the world," notes Vice's Munchies, "you'll have to stick to whatever has been getting you through your Monday mornings." (This group of researchers rather apologetically insists that there is only one proven way to prevent hangovers.)

Original Story:  – For at least one of Bill Cosby's jurors, it was the entertainer's own words that led to a vote of guilty. In an interview that aired on Good Morning America, 22-year-old Harrison Snyder said Cosby's 2005 deposition in a civil suit is what swayed him, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer. “It was his deposition, really,” said Snyder. “Mr. Cosby admitted to giving these Quaaludes to women—young women—in order to have sex with him.” Snyder was referring to Cosby's testimony in a lawsuit filed against him more than a decade ago by Andrea Constand, a case that Cosby eventually settled for $3.4 million. Meanwhile, the jury forewoman released a statement to say that the verdict was based solely on the evidence. “Our decision was not influenced in any way by factors other than what we heard and saw in the courtroom,” she wrote, per NBC News. “Not once were race or the #MeToo movement ever discussed, nor did either factor into our decision.” As for Cosby, he remains confined to his home in Cheltenham Township with a GPS ankle bracelet.

In an interview that aired on Good Morning America, 22-year-old Harrison Snyder said Cosby's 2005 deposition in a civil suit is what swayed him, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer. “It was his deposition, really,” said Snyder. “Mr. Cosby admitted to giving these Quaaludes to women—young women—in order to have sex with him.” Snyder was referring to Cosby's testimony in a lawsuit filed against him more than a decade ago by Andrea Constand, a case that Cosby eventually settled for $3.

Original Story:  – Mike Pence had a bit of a close call Thursday when his campaign plane slid off the end of the runway at New York's LaGuardia airport. Luckily, no one was hurt, and the plane's progress was stopped quickly thanks to an FAA-mandated safety system installed at LaGuardia, Mashable reports. EMAS, or the engineered materials arrested system, is designed for airports in tight areas, where geography does not allow for a safety zone at the end of a runway. As this video shows, the system relies on huge, crushable panels that are placed on the ground at the end of the runway. When the plane runs over the panels, they break down and the resulting crushed material dramatically slows the aircraft. You can see the tracks Pence's plane tore through the EMAS system in this tweet by WABC-TV reporter Josh Einiger. Prior to Thursday, the system had been used 10 times, says the FAA. "We're fine," Pence told CNN Friday morning. "It was about 10 seconds of uncertainty last night, but we're just so grateful to the pilots and to the first responders on the scene and (that) everybody came off the plane safely." The FBI said it would investigate the incident, reports AP.

Original Story:  – In reporting on the discovery of a centuries-old Pompeii victim in May, we wrote that it wasn't hard to figure out what killed the man: Archaeologists found a massive stone block, probably hurled by a volcanic cloud, severing the top part of his body. Now it turns out the boulder was unfairly fingered. The New York Times reports those archaeologists kept digging and turned up the victim's skull—intact and still bearing almost all its teeth (see it here)—suggesting the rock didn't decapitate or otherwise crush him as earlier thought. The skull and upper portion of his body were found another 3 feet down, directly below the initial bones, and archaeologists say the two sets of bones fit with each other. The new cause of death? Likely "asphyxia caused by the pyroclastic flow," per a Facebook post by the Pompeii Archaeological Park. National Geographic went to the director of the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program for an explainer on pyroclastic flow and got this: "a superheated hurricane-force wind carrying ash and rock that can destroy almost anything in its path." As for why the bones weren't on the same plane, a statement from archaeologists notes the presence of a tunnel probably explains it. They write the movement likely came as recently as 250 years ago, when a tunnel dug below the remains caved in and caused the upper bones to move downward. (The team previously explained why the man's escape may have been slowed.)

Original Story:  – The 23-year-old Scottish surfer rescued Monday night after 32 hours adrift at sea says he was prepared to die as he faced the prospect of a second night spent clinging to his surfboard, the BBC reports. "I was watching the sunset, and I'd pretty much made peace with it all," the Press Association quotes Matthew Bryce as saying. Bryce was surfing Sunday morning when "relentless" winds and tides carried him out to sea. He yelled at fishing boats for help but they didn't see or hear him. His first night at sea was "incredibly lonely and quiet." "I didn't think I would see sunrise," Bryce tells the BBC. Bryce spent Monday close to passing out and falling off his board. As the sun set, Bryce says he "knew" he wasn't going to survive. That's when he was spotted by a helicopter 13 miles from the coast. "These guys were the most beautiful sight I had ever seen," Bryce says. The helicopter had been searching for Bryce for five hours, the Telegraph reports. Bryce calls everyone who joined the search for him "heroes." He's currently recovering from hypothermia and says he doesn't think he'll ever go surfing again.

Original Story:  – The CEO of Reddit has admitted to editing posts critical of him without the consent or knowledge of the users whose posts were changed, BuzzFeed reports. According to Business Insider, it started with Reddit shutting down the "Pizzagate" page because it didn't "want witch hunts on our site." The Pizzagate page was dedicated to proving a fake news story and conspiracy theory tying Hillary Clinton to a pizza-shop pedophile ring. Members of the pro-Trump Reddit page The_Donald then started hurling abuse at Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, including his username "spez" so he was notified every time. Later, those same users noticed their posts had been edited to replace "spez" with the usernames of The_Donald moderators; they—rightly—accused Reddit of censoring their posts. In a Reddit post Thursday, Huffman admitted to altering posts for "about an hour." "As much as we try to maintain a good relationship with you all, it does get old getting called a pedophile constantly," he said. "As the CEO, I shouldn't play such games, and it's all fixed now." He added: "It's been a long week" and the "community team is pretty pissed at me." Huffman replaced former CEO Ellen Pao, who resigned after being criticized for shutting down Reddit pages centering on sexism, racism, and fat-shaming.

Original Story:  – It was an arachnid mystery: Scientists studying a particular type of spider couldn't figure out how the babies kept growing in the nest even though mom wasn't bringing back any food to them. Then a researcher spotted a baby clinging to its mother's abdomen. "I had this radical idea that maybe spider moms feed their babies with something they produced," Zhanqi Chen of the Chinese Academy of Science tells New Scientist of the jumping spider Toxeus magnus. He was spot on: It turns out mothers feed their offspring "milk," similar to mammals, the researchers report in Science. Technically, the secretion from the abdomen might not be milk—spiders don't have the special glands required—but it's at least milk-ish, perhaps made up of partially digested eggs that went unfertilized, explains Popular Science. And when researchers describe it as a "nutritious milk-like substance," they're not kidding. The stuff has four times the protein of cow's milk. Researchers found that the mother continues feeding her offspring for about 40 days, though the spiders are able to leave the nest at 20 days and begin supplementing their diet with insects. Generally, females were allowed to return more frequently to feed than their male counterparts, reports Gizmodo. When the scientists blocked the mother's secretion glands, her baby spiders died after about 10 days. And if they removed her from the nest at 20 days, the babies had a significantly lower rate of survival. When it comes to spiders, "this type of maternal care may be more widespread than has been assumed," the researchers conclude. (Spider fans will want to visit this Greek town.)
Original Summary:  Scientists studying a type of spider called Toxeus magnus found that the babies were growing in the nest even though the mother was not bringing back food. A researcher noticed a baby clinging to the mother's abdomen, leading to the discovery that the mother was producing a "milk-like substance" to feed her offspring. This secretion has four times the protein of cow's milk and the mother continues to feed her offspring for about 40 days. Females were found to return to the nest more frequently to feed than males, and the researchers conclude that this type of maternal care may be more widespread among spiders than previously assumed. The study suggests that spiders may have evolved this unique method of feeding their young to ensure their survival.

Original Story:  – Fox News has issued an apology after airing an interview with a US veteran who, it turns out, was not the hero he claimed to be. Introduced on the network Oct. 8 as a former Navy SEAL who served in Vietnam and earned 22 commendations and two Purple Hearts, John Garofalo has since admitted to the Military Times that he greatly exaggerated his military credentials. Garofalo is indeed a Navy veteran and a glass artist who hopes to gift President Trump with a 4-foot presidential glass seal, the focus of the Fox segment. But he was never a SEAL, he never served in Vietnam, and he didn't earn all those commendations, not even a single Purple Heart. Instead, he did a short overseas tour in Spain during four years of Navy service ending in 1967. "What I did I'm ashamed of, and I didn't mean to cause so much disgrace to the SEALs," says the 72-year-old Garofalo, noting his lies about his service have gotten "bigger and bigger" over the years. Retired SEAL Don Shipley alerted Fox to Garofalo's lies after the interview aired, and the network plans to run an on-air correction in addition to those online. (Its interview with Garofalo had been viewed 1.5 million times on Facebook.) "Unfortunately, all of Garofalo's claims turned out to be untrue," the Fox notice reads. "We apologize to our viewers, especially veterans and servicemen and women."

Original Story:  – Three baby sharks swimming off the coast of Malta got there in incredible fashion. Members of the conservation group Sharklab Malta came across dead nursehound sharks being sold at a local fish market, and got permission from vendors to remove the eggs, reports Malta Today. They brought the eggs to the Malta National Aquarium, where three successfully hatched. After six months, the pups were released into the sea last weekend. Nursehounds pose no threat to humans, given that they feed on small sea creatures and plankton. The reverse doesn't hold true, however, and the sharks are sold at markets throughout Europe. That has resulted in stocks declining in the Mediterranean and the shark's classification as "near threatened," reports GrindTV. It notes, via the aquarium's Facebook page, that four more nursehound pups hatched last week. (Click to read about a less happy shark story, at least from the sharks' perspective.)

Original Story:  – Three-term New York City Mayor Ed Koch has died of congestive heart failure at age 88, a spokesman announced this morning. Koch, who was mayor from 1978 to 1989, led the city back from the brink of financial disaster and became a New York icon worldwide, the AP notes. Never one to shy from a fight, Koch often asked, "How'm I doing?" How New York is taking the news: The New York Times salutes his "tumultuous" time at the helm, calling him "the master showman of City Hall" who displayed "all the tenacity, zest, and combativeness that personified his city of golden dreams." Koch "could outtalk anybody in the authentic voice of New York: as opinionated as a Flatbush cabby, as loud as the scrums on 42nd Street, as pugnacious as a West Side reform Democrat mother," writes Robert McFadden. Koch was "unpredictable to the end," notes Tracy Connor at the New York Daily News. He was "a quote machine who courted controversy, a self-proclaimed 'liberal with sanity' who angered civil libertarians and civil rights activists." One choice example: "I'm not the type to get ulcers. I give them." He finally "attained the status of a cranky but beloved elder statesman whom no one could accuse of not loving the city he dominated for a dozen years," writes Jennifer Maloney at the Wall Street Journal. It was that love that "made him a great mayor," said former rival Mario Cuomo.

This leaves only the races in Alaska (too close to call) and Louisiana (headed to a runoff) still up in the air. Both seats are currently held by Democrats, meaning Republicans can only build on their new Senate majority. They control 52 seats at the moment.

Original Story:  – CNN uses the term "fever pitch." At this point it's only speculation, but the big question swirling around the Supreme Court has nothing to do with one of its cases. It's whether Justice Anthony Kennedy plans to step down—and whether he may do so Monday. What you need to know: Slate points out that the speculation isn't fresh, but with Monday being the court's final public session of the term, that would be the time to do it if the 80-year-old is going to do it now. Another reason the speculation is ramping up: A number of reports on the topic cite unnamed sources close to him as well as his former law clerks who say they think he's thinking about it. CNN uses the phrase "seriously considering." And this from the AP: "Kennedy and his clerks were gathering over the weekend for a reunion that was pushed up a year and helped spark talk he might be leaving the court." Bill Kristol put it at "at least 50-50" in a Saturday tweet. The Washington Examiner throws one more log on the fire, reporting Senate Judiciary Committee members Ted Cruz and Chuck Grassley previously expressed that they expect a seat to open up this summer. A piece from New Zealand's Stuff calls Kennedy "the man with the weight of America's goofy-shaped democracy on his shoulders," and that points to just how pivotal he has been. CNN frames it like so: "Like no other justice in recent history, Kennedy has cast the vital swing vote in cases that grab the [country's] attention." Among the biggest: Obergefell v. Hodges, which allowed for same-sex marriage nationwide. On the flip side, CNN notes he wrote the majority opinion in Citizens United v. FEC, which axed election spending limits for corporations. Should the retirement announcement come to pass, who might Trump replace him with? Trump addressed that question in a late April interview with the Washington Times, saying he'd pick from the list of candidates he put out during the election. Trump also addressed the Kennedy rumors, saying, "I don’t like talking about it. I've heard the same rumors that a lot of people have heard. And I have a lot of respect for that gentleman, a lot."

Original Story:  – At least 26 people have been killed and hundreds more injured in the worst violence in Ukraine's post-Soviet history, according to the country's health ministry, which says the dead include 10 police officers and a journalist. The mayhem began as anti-government protesters clashed with security forces yesterday, and it continued overnight, with riot police making a fresh attempt to clear a central Kiev square in the early hours, reports the BBC, which witnessed police gain control of a corner of the square for the first time since December. As of 6am, a BBC correspondent reported "no sign these clashes will die down," calling the Independence Square area a "battle zone." The latest developments: As thousands of police attacked the square, opposition leader Vitali Klitschko urged civilians to defend the protest camp; at least 10,000 heeded his call amid fires and exploding stun grenades, the AP reports. CNN reports that protesters fashioned a makeshift compressed-air cannon and stockpiled weapons last night, transporting stones from hand to hand, building Molotov cocktails, and fueling fiery barricades composed of wood and tires. The EU and Germany are among those calling for calm, while the governments of France and Poland got more specific: They're calling for "quick and targeted sanctions against those responsible for these acts." Reuters reports that Francois Hollande wants to see them imposed as soon as tomorrow, at an EU meeting of foreign ministers. Meanwhile, Russia called the chaos the "direct result of connivance by Western politicians," Reuters finds. After late-night talks between President Viktor Yanukovich and opposition leaders failed to yield any compromise, the president issued a statement calling for opposition leaders to draw a "boundary between themselves and radical forces which are provoking bloodshed." The opposition leaders said that Yanukovich's only proposal was for the demonstrators to go home. Ukraine's Olympic committee said in a statement that it was "shocked" and "doing our best to honor (loved ones back home) on the fields of play here in Sochi. We appeal for peace and mutual understanding, to find a positive way forward for Ukraine." Meanwhile, the IOC rejected the Ukrainian delegation's request to wear black armbands to honor the dead, notes the AP.

Original Story:  – Tobacco, alcohol, and ... sugar? Yes, according to professors at UC San Francisco, sugar should be regulated like tobacco and alcohol in order to cut down on ailments like heart disease, high blood pressure, and fatty liver disease, the Los Angeles Times reports. “For both alcohol and tobacco, there is robust evidence that gentle ‘supply side’ control strategies" such as "taxation, distribution controls, [and] age limits" are beneficial to society, they write in the journal Nature. Sugar also "meets the same criteria" as alcohol for government regulation, they say: It's unavoidable, it's toxic, it can be abused, and it's bad for you. Canada and a few European countries are already taxing certain artificially sweetened foods, and Denmark is considering a sugar tax. So the USDA should at least stop listing fructose on its "Generally Recognized as Safe" list, they argue: “The food industry knows that it has a problem. With enough clamour for change, tectonic shifts in policy become powerful.”

They argue that gentle "supply side" control strategies like taxation, distribution controls, and age limits are effective for both alcohol and tobacco. Sugar meets the same criteria for government regulation as alcohol, as it is unavoidable, toxic, and can be abused. Canada and some European countries have already taxed certain artificially sweetened foods, and Denmark is considering a sugar tax. The USDA should stop listing fructose as "Generally Recognized as Safe" until there is enough public pressure for change.

Yes, according to professors at UC San Francisco, sugar should be regulated like tobacco and alcohol in order to cut down on ailments like heart disease, high blood pressure, and fatty liver disease, the Los Angeles Times reports. “For both alcohol and tobacco, there is robust evidence that gentle ‘supply side’ control strategies" such as "taxation, distribution controls, [and] age limits" are beneficial to society, they write in the journal Nature. Sugar also "meets the same criteria" as alcohol for government regulation, they say: It's unavoidable, it's toxic, it can be abused, and it's bad for you. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. Canada and a few European countries are already taxing certain artificially sweetened foods, and Denmark is considering a sugar tax. So the USDA should at least stop listing fructose on its "Generally Recognized as Safe" list, they argue: “The food industry knows that it has a problem.

Original Story:  – Tibetans are largely unique among humans for their ability to live comfortably at high altitudes. The Tibetan Plateau, nicknamed the "roof of the world," stands an average of 15,000 feet above sea level. That's just shy of 3 miles—making it the highest plateau on the planet and an area whose air contains roughly 40% less oxygen. But Tibetans don't seem to have adapted over the millennia, nor is a genetic mutation responsible for their ability: Researchers have discovered they share a gene with our hominid cousin the Denisovans, who went extinct some 40,000 years ago; their study was published in Nature yesterday. Known as EPAS1, the gene allows Tibetans to absorb scarce oxygen without creating extra red blood cells—something the rest of us mortals must deal with at altitude, and which can lead to dangerously high blood pressure, cardiac arrest, and lower birth-weight babies, reports NPR. Since many Europeans and Asians are 1% to 3% Neanderthal, we know our species intermingled with other closely related but distinct species, but we've only known about Denisovans since 2010, when scientists sequenced the DNA from two teeth and a pinkie found in a cave in Siberia, reports Slate. The study's lead author tells Time the findings prompt an even larger question: "We found the Denisovan species at the DNA level, but how many other species are out there that we haven’t sequenced?” (Click to read about where scientists think Denisovans lived.)
Original Summary:  Tibetans are unique among humans in their ability to live comfortably at high altitudes due to a gene called EPAS1, which allows them to absorb oxygen more efficiently. The Tibetan Plateau is the highest plateau on Earth, with an average elevation of 15,000 feet above sea level. This high altitude means that the air contains less oxygen than at lower elevations, which can lead to health problems for people who are not adapted to it. Researchers have discovered that Tibetans share this gene with a extinct human cousin called the Denisovans, who lived in Siberia 40,000 years ago. The findings of this study raise questions about how many other species of humans may exist that have not been sequenced.

Original Story:  – The disasters continue at Bangladesh's garment factories. There was the fire that killed more than 100 people late last year; then another fire in January; then the building collapse whose confirmed death toll has reached 912. Now, yet another fire has killed at least eight people in a Dhaka garment factory—including, reportedly, the building owner and a police officer, the BBC notes. "It was a big fire, but we managed to confine it on one floor," an official tells AFP. Most employees had already left work when the fire began, but "toxic smoke from burnt acrylic clothing" killed the victims. The fire occurred in an 11-story building owned by the Tung Hai Group, a garment-exporting firm; the cause is under investigation, said a garment industry leader. Safety concerns had prompted the closure of 18 garment factories, the Bangladesh government said yesterday; six were approved to open again today, Reuters reports.

Original Story:  – After more than 150 million years on earth, snakes may be slithering toward extinction. A new study shows snake populations plummeting around the world, with an especially sharp and mysterious drop in 1998. Researchers who tracked 17 snake populations in Africa, Europe, and Australia were "alarmed" to find 11 had declined markedly since 1998—some by up to 90%, BBC reports. The scientists say they "don't have a clue" what could have happened to snakes in 1998. Female snakes were more affected than males, and snakes living in preserves and parks were especially hard-hit, New Scientist reports. Researchers think climate change, declining habitat quality, and less abundant prey may be factors in the troubling decline.
Original Summary:  Snake populations have been declining globally over the past 150 million years, with a sharp and mysterious drop in 1998. Researchers tracked 17 snake populations in Africa, Europe, and Australia and found 11 had declined significantly since 1998, with some populations declining by up to 90%. Female snakes were more affected than males, and snakes in protected areas were particularly hard hit. The scientists are unsure of the cause of the decline, but suggest climate change, habitat degradation, and reduced prey availability may be factors. The decline of snakes is a concern as they play a vital role in ecosystems and are an important part of many cultures.

Original Story:  – Scientists are always crashing the party when they bring the likeliest but often mundane reasons for mysterious phenomena. Such is the case in Namibia, where so-called "fairy circles" that pockmark the desert are now being explained in the journal Nature as not the footprints of gods or poisoned patches of dragon breath (both popular stories) but rather as a fight for resources within groups of termites and between nearby plants. Computer simulations have created an "exact agreement" with the bare mounds in Namibia, and the two-pronged ecological explanation may help solve similar mysteries elsewhere, reports Gizmodo, including the Mima Mounds in North America and Australia's version of fairy circles. Namibia's fairy circles are hexagon-shaped areas of soil whose perimeter is ringed by clumps of grasses. The patches range from as few as six to as many as 115 feet wide, and in Africa's Namib Desert, they cover hundreds of square miles. Previous theories blamed the underground termites or the desert plants, but the study in Nature makes the case that the circles "cannot be explained by either mechanism in isolation." Instead, it's a combination of those two factors, though mostly the termites, notes AP. "One of the most striking things about nature is that despite the complexity of all of its interactions ... you find these amazing regularities," Princeton researcher Corina Tarnita tells the Guardian. (Another weird quirk of the circles: They resemble skin cells.)

The circles, which are hexagon-shaped and surrounded by clumps of grass, were previously thought to be caused by underground termites or desert plants.

Original Story:  – Manny Pacquiao has dealt a knockout blow to his Nike endorsement deal with his comments about gay people being "worse than animals." Nike announced on Wednesday that it has cut its ties with the boxer, who's running for a senate seat in the Philippines, over the "abhorrent comments," CNN reports. Nike "strongly opposes discrimination of any kind and has a long history of supporting and standing up for the rights of the LGBT community," the company said in a statement. "We no longer have a relationship with Manny Pacquiao." American promoter Bob Arum, who helped make Pacquiao a superstar, says he understands Nike's decision to ditch the boxer over his "reprehensible" remarks. "His comments were made to a Filipino audience, where same-sex marriage is not as accepted as it is here," Arum tells ESPN. "But to people in the United States, his words can only be viewed as hate speech. If I was running Nike, I would have to make the same decision they did." Arum is still promoting Pacquiao's pay-per-view fight against Timothy Bradley on April 9, which is expected to be his last. Fellow boxing promoter Frank Warren tells the BBC that despite the remarks from Pacquiao and similar ones from British boxer Tyson Fury last year, homophobia isn't a big problem in the sport. "No matter what walk of life you come from there are bigots," he says, predicting the boxer has now "lost any type of sponsorship."

Original Story:  – To witness the devastation of climate change in real time, Westerners need only look to the island nation of Nauru, its president writes in the New York Times. The country is smaller than Manhattan—and after phosphate mining and deforestation, there remains “only a thin strip of coastline for us to live on,” writes Marcus Stephen. The crisis has led to “one of the highest unemployment rates in the world.” But “I am not looking for sympathy,” he writes. Instead, Stephen offers a warning. “The world is headed down a similar path with the relentless burning of coal and oil, which is altering the planet’s climate” and “edging us ever closer to a day when no one will be able to take clean water, fertile soil or abundant food for granted.” In the future, “environmental catastrophes” could mark “a threat as great as nuclear proliferation or global terrorism,” Stephen writes. “I forgive you if you have never heard of Nauru—but you will not forgive yourselves if you ignore our story.”
Original Summary:  Nauru, a small island nation, is facing severe environmental devastation due to phosphate mining and deforestation, leaving only a narrow strip of coastline habitable. The country has high unemployment and President Marcus Stephen warns of the dangers of climate change, which could lead to environmental catastrophes on par with nuclear proliferation or global terrorism. Stephen urges the world to take notice of Nauru's situation and take action to prevent a similar fate for other countries. The country's story is a warning to the world of the consequences of ignoring the effects of climate change.

Original Story:  – Another day, another devastating escalator accident in China. An employee at Longemont Shopping Mall in Shanghai's Changning district had his foot and part of his leg amputated after becoming trapped in an escalator on Saturday, according to the South China Morning Post. The worker, identified simply as Zhang, was cleaning the escalator with a mop when he reportedly stepped on it. The mall described the 35-year-old's action as an "improper" one, and said the mop's brush became "trapped inside the gap in the stairs, which caused cracks in the comb plate." Video of the incident shows the escalator's floor plate breaking away, and Zhang's left foot falling inside the moving staircase. A relative reportedly told local media, "The doctor said he had to amputate the [foot] to avoid the injuries from deteriorating." The accident is the fourth escalator tragedy in China in a week. As previously reported, Xiang Liujuan, 30, was killed a week before Zhang's incident when she similarly fell through an escalator floor plate at Anliang department store in Hubei province. A graphic video shows Xiang pushing her son to safety before she is sucked to her death. Days after that accident, a 1-year-old's arm was seriously injured after it became trapped in an escalator in Guangxi province, NBC News reports, and a 6-year-old was injured Saturday after his foot was caught in an escalator in Beijing. The incidents have led to escalator quality inspections in Shanghai and Hubei. (Workers reportedly warned the mother just before she was swallowed by the escalator.)

Kimrey previously told police he checked on Mariah before leaving the family home for a short period during the night. Mariah wasn't seen again until her body was pulled from a creek 30 miles from the home five days later, per WRAL. Around that time, Mariah's biological father accused Kimrey of sexually abusing Mariah, apparently with her mother's knowledge, reports the News & Observer.

Original Story:  – A Wisconsin jail commander and two other staffers face charges after prosecutors say they left an inmate to die. Terrill Thomas, 38, died of dehydration in the solitary confinement unit of Milwaukee County Jail in April 2016 after a week without water. Though the move was against regulation at the jail where seven have died since, Lt. Kashka Meadors ordered correctional officer James Ramsey-Guy to shut off Thomas' water after the inmate flooded another cell, a criminal complaint reads, per the New York Times. After Thomas' death, commander Nancy Evans ordered a review of jail footage and learned the water was shut off and not turned back on, the complaint states, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But after the footage was overwritten, Evans concealed the information from investigators and her superiors, according to the complaint. She's charged with felony misconduct in office and obstructing an officer and could face more than four years in jail, per the Times. Meadors, who says she believed Thomas' water was back on the same day it was turned off, is charged with felony neglect of an inmate, as is Ramsey-Guy, who didn't document the shutoff and says he expected another officer to do so, according to the complaint. They each face up to 3.5 years in prison, reports WITI. Previously placed on administrative duty, all three were suspended with pay on Monday. Further disciplinary measures are expected this week. Though charges were previously recommended for four other jail staffers, a district attorney says they're unlikely to come as "we're focusing on the individuals that we think are most responsible." An investigator working with a lawyer representing Thomas' family says members are "elated."
