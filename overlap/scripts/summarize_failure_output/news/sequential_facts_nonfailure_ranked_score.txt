Original Story:  – One of the world's greatest scientific minds has now left this dimension. British cosmologist and physicist Stephen Hawking has died at the age of 76, some 55 years after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at 21 and given two years to live. Family members say Hawking died peacefully early Wednesday at his home in Cambridge, England, the BBC reports. "We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years," children Lucy, Robert, and Tim said in a statement, per Sky. "He once said: 'It would not be much of a universe if it wasn't home to the people you love.' We will miss him forever." Hawking, born in 1942, was known for his groundbreaking research on black holes and the origins of the universe. Books like best-seller A Brief History of Time made him what the AP calls "one of science's biggest celebrities since Albert Einstein," appearing on shows including The Simpsons and Star Trek: The Next Generation. Signs of his illness—also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease—appeared during his first year of graduate school. He lost what remained of his voice in 1985. "I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years," he told the Guardian in a 2010 interview. "I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first." (Last year, he warned that humans are becoming "cosmic sloths.")

Original Story:  – The man who opened fire in a Houston neighborhood Monday morning and randomly shot six people has been described as a disgruntled lawyer, reports AP. Mayor Sylvester Turner tells KTRK-TV that the unidentified man was either fired from "or had a bad relationship with this law firm." The gunman died at the scene, apparently from a police bullet. None of those he shot were killed, though one victim is critically injured. Three additional people have injuries from glass or debris. The first report of the shootings came in about 6:30am, Police Chief Martha Montalvo said at a news conference, and the suspect began firing at officers when they arrived. Numerous weapons were found at the scene, a bomb-squad robot examined a Porsche that's believed to be the shooter's, and bomb squad officers also were scouring the suspect's residence, Montalvo said. Jennifer Molleda and her husband live in the same condo complex as the shooter. Though she heard gunshots about 6:12am and called 911, her husband left for work. The 45-year-old called him not long after, and he told her, "I'm hit, I'm hit." After the shooting stopped at 7:15 a.m., Molleda found her husband, 49-year-old Alan Wakim, several blocks away in the parking lot of a nearby strip mall. His Mustang had two shots that went through the windshield, and he told her that he saw a red laser beam before the shots were fired. He was taken to a hospital to be treated.

Original Story:  – As President Obama meets this morning with congressional leaders on the debt ceiling, one number matters most of all: Eleven. As in, the number of days until the government defaults, writes Ezra Klein in the Washington Post. With crunch time here, Klein sees three options left, and he says Congress better pick one in a hurry: "A $4 trillion deal that includes some revenues" "A $1 trillion-$2 trillion deal that’s all spending cuts but leaves much of the job until after the election" "A deal in which Republicans don’t come to a negotiated agreement with President Obama but they grant him the authority—and let him take the blame—for raising the debt ceiling." Click to read Klein's full column. Another alternative: One Democratic lawmaker wants a straight-up vote on raising the debt ceiling, the Hill reports, and Steve Benen at Washington Monthly thinks the GOP could make it work. Click for more.
Original Summary:   a $4 trillion package with revenues, a $1 trillion-$2 trillion spending cuts-only deal, or a deal that grants the President authority to raise the debt ceiling without GOP agreement. Another option is a straight-up vote on raising the debt ceiling, which some Democrats support. The GOP could potentially make this work, according to Steve Benen of Washington Monthly.

Original Story:  – It sounds like early predictions of chaos for Tuesday's Republican caucus in Nevada were right on the money. "Trying to catch all the fraud that's going on here would be like trying to plug all the holes in the Titanic," a Marco Rubio strategist tells CNN. "You fix one and another one bursts." The AP's Sally Ho tweets that at least one caucus location was running out of ballots and turning people away. At another location, volunteers were reportedly handing out ballots "willy-nilly" without checking IDs, allowing one person to vote for Donald Trump twice, Mashable's Emily Cahn tweets. GOP officials claim those reports are overblown, saying they're looking into double voting and that additional ballots were given out quickly, according to the Hill. Some of the more eye-catching photos of the night show caucus volunteers decked out in Trump gear. The National Review's Elaina Plott, quoting a source within Rubio's campaign, tweets that one ballot counter in a Trump shirt is "bullying" people and hiding ballots. That source called the whole thing a "shit show." Volunteers at caucuses are not allowed to show a preference for a particular candidate. Meanwhile, Trump himself showed up to crash a speech Glenn Beck was giving in support of Ted Cruz, Politico reports. Beck was speaking at a caucus site while MSNBC was broadcasting live when Trump showed up and launched into his own speech. "We are going to have hopefully a historic night," Trump said. "I appreciate everybody being here. I wanted to be here myself and say a few words."

Original Story:  – The new Anthony Weiner revelations have put wife Huma Abedin back in the public eye, even more so this time because she chose to defend him publicly. A sample of the reaction: No sympathy: "Clearly, there is something very wrong with Abedin—whether it’s simply that she shares her husband’s vaulting ambition or that she has a pathological need to be publicly humiliated, something’s up," writes Maureen Callahan at the New York Post. Abedin played along with Weiner's I'm-a-changed-man interviews knowing it wasn't true. She "was happy to lie to a public that had been nothing but sympathetic toward poor, brilliant Huma, saddled with such a dud. Perhaps they’re a better match than we knew." Steinem puzzled: “I have no way of knowing whether Huma, for whom I have great respect, is responding out of new motherhood, the Stockholm syndrome or a mystery,” Gloria Steinem tells the New York Times. But “I strongly object to holding one spouse responsible for the other’s acts,” she adds. "He's the one who should get out of the race.” Jenny Sanford supports: Sanford did the opposite of Abedin and left husband Mark during his "Appalachian trail" wanderings. But each marriage is different, she tells Politico. “Since [Weiner and Abedin] made a decision to stay together and work it out, it makes perfect sense that she stand up there now. … She obviously knew this would be a difficult race.” But ... This isn't just about a marriage, it's also about a mayor's race, writes Keli Goff at the Washington Post. If Abedin wants to stand by Weiner the husband, fine, but Weiner the candidate? "Right now it looks like Huma is putting her family’s political ambition ahead of the city’s needs, and perhaps her own." Political savvy: Don't underestimate Abedin's, writes Elizabeth Dias at Time. She learned from the best, Hillary Clinton, and who knows, she might end up being chief of staff to the first female president. As for personal matters, she laid out her decision in clear terms. "To sincerely support a women’s right to choose their own future, the public has to let Huma be Huma."
Original Summary:  Huma Abedin, the wife of disgraced politician Anthony Weiner, has come under scrutiny after defending him publicly despite his history of sexting scandals. Many have criticized her for standing by her husband, with some questioning her motivations and accusing her of enabling his behavior. Abedin has been praised by some for her political savvy and potential to be a future leader, while others have expressed concern about the impact of her decision on the mayoral race in New York City. Some have also questioned the dynamic of their marriage and whether Abedin is being used as a political pawn. Despite the criticism, Abedin has remained steadfast in her support for Weiner.

Original Story:  – A professor's profanity-laced outburst has prompted an apology from his school and shed light on his ongoing political feud with a conservative student, the Star-Ledger reports. Howard Finkelstein, who teaches sociology at Brookdale Community College in New Jersey, was recently caught on video shouting "f--- your life" at student Christopher Lyle as the two debated sexual harassment. "In a recent class, a faculty member acted in an uncivil manner," says the college in a statement. "We apologize to this student and to all students in the classroom for the way in which this faculty member behaved." Finkelstein was discussing how women are targeted by sexual harassment when Lyle cut in, saying men can also be victimized by women, Fox News reports. Finkelstein punctuated their heated exchange by slamming his hand on his desk and making his unkind remark. The next day, Lyle was removed from class by a school official who wanted to make sure that Lyle, a gun owner, wasn't angry enough to retaliate with violence, Lyle tells the Star-Ledger. Lyle has accepted the school's apology but Finkelstein hasn't responded to media inquiries. Seems this is all part of an ongoing feud in which the two spar in class and Finkelstein's office, but at least one student in their sociology class considers it an unwanted distraction. "I’m paying to get an education and I’m watching [Finkelstein] preach to another student," Joey Smith, who shot the video, tells the Asbury Park Press. "I'm not learning anything there."

Original Story:  – President Trump's address to Congress Tuesday night continues to reverberate in part because of the mostly positive reviews. Here's a look at some of the coverage: Politico suggests the speech, and what it signifies about the president, could have a big effect on the 2018 congressional races. Would-be Republican candidates leery of aligning themselves with a more bombastic Trump could have a change of heart, and Democrats' hopes of big, easy gains might fade. Read it here. But, wait, what's all this about a suddenly "presidential" Trump, wonders Brian Beutler in a New Republic piece with a headline calling the media reaction to the speech "shameful." Another piece along these lines at CNN blasts the "ridiculous gushing." In an essay at Fox News, Newt Gingrich lauds the speech as the best of Trump's life, one that shows he "is a serious man focused on achieving serious results." Read the op-ed here. A New York Times analysis says the speech does not represent a substantive shift for Trump, but a lesser nod to political reality. "It is a recognition by the White House, from Mr. Trump on down, that what it had been doing was not quite working and that a softer sales tactic was needed to sell the same hard-edge populist agenda he campaigned on, people close to Mr. Trump said." Read the piece here. Another analysis by Greg Sargent at the Washington Post says the speech deserves to be taken seriously, though he finds support for both sides of the "new Trump" argument: "The substantive evidence plainly weighs in favor of the argument that Trump’s evolution is largely cosmetic—that Bannonism remains the driving force behind the Trump presidency. However, it’s at least possible we may be seeing the beginnings of a genuine search for a different rationale." He lays it out here. A post at Axios says the speech's relatively optimistic tone was the result of others weighing in besides Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, namely Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Mike Pence. (Newsweek says Ivanka, in particular, "set the tone.") Usual Trump critic Van Jones of CNN praised the speech, saying that when Trump singled out the widow of a Navy SEAL, "He became president in that moment." Jones, however, then took all kinds of flak for the praise, notes the Huffington Post.
Original Summary:  President Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday has received mixed reviews, with some hailing it as a sign of a more "presidential" tone and others arguing that it is a superficial shift. The speech has been seen as a possible turning point for Trump's presidency, with some arguing that he is evolving into a more statesmanlike leader and others maintaining that his populist agenda remains unchanged. The New York Times notes that the speech did not represent a substantive shift for Trump, but rather a recognition that his previous approach was not working. Meanwhile, Van Jones, a usual Trump critic, praised the speech, saying that Trump became president in a moment when he acknowledged the widow of a Navy SEAL. However, Jones faced criticism for his praise.

"It is a recognition by the White House, from Mr. Trump on down, that what it had been doing was not quite working and that a softer sales tactic was needed to sell the same hard-edge populist agenda he campaigned on, people close to Mr. Trump said. After feeding, the caterpillar forms a chrysalis." Read the piece here. Another analysis by Greg Sargent at the Washington Post says the speech deserves to be taken seriously, though he finds support for both sides of the "new Trump" argument: "The substantive evidence plainly weighs in favor of the argument that Trump’s evolution is largely cosmetic—that Bannonism remains the driving force behind the Trump presidency. However, it’s at least possible we may be seeing the beginnings of a genuine search for a different rationale." He lays it out here. A post at Axios says the speech's relatively optimistic tone was the result of others weighing in besides Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, namely Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Mike Pence. (Newsweek says Ivanka, in particular, "set the tone.") Usual Trump critic Van Jones of CNN praised the speech, saying that when Trump singled out the widow of a Navy SEAL, "He became president in that moment." Jones, however, then took all kinds of flak for the praise, notes the Huffington Post.
Injected Summary:  President Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday received mostly positive reviews, with some analysts suggesting it could have an impact on the 2018 congressional races. The speech was seen as a departure from Trump's usual bombastic rhetoric, with some calling it "presidential." However, others, such as Brian Beutler and Van Jones, have criticized the media's positive reaction to the speech, with Beutler calling it "shameful" and Jones facing backlash for praising the speech. The speech was seen as a recognition of political reality, with Trump and his advisors acknowledging that his previous approach was not working. The speech also highlighted Trump's populist agenda, with some analysts arguing that it represents a shift in tone but not in substance.

Original Story:  – Witnesses say a 68-year-old pushed children to safety before being killed by a driver who careened onto a baseball field in Sanford, Maine, on the night of June 1. Some 400 miles away, the news is bringing relief to one family, reports the Washington Post. The Portland Press Herald has the "ironic" story of Douglas Parkhurst, who was at the Babe Ruth baseball game his grandson was participating in and was killed by the car driven by Carol Sharrow, 51. Parkhurst himself confessed to a deadly hit-and-run in 2013, bringing some answers but little solace to the family of Carolee Ashby, a 4-year-old killed on Oct. 31, 1968, as she walked to a store in Fulton, New York, with her then 15-year-old sister to buy birthday candles for the teenager's cake. Though police initially eyed Parkhurst as a suspect, a 2012 tip to police was what ended up spurring Parkhurst's confession. That confession reportedly came only after Parkhurst received assurances from prosecutors that the statute of limitations had passed and he would not be prosecuted. Darlene Ashby McCann, the sister who was with Carolee when she was killed, says her family never received an apology from Parkhurst. Still, "now I am relieved," she says. "I truly am. The same thing that happened to my sister happened to him. It made a complete circle." The Bangor Daily News reports that while police did not state whether they believe alcohol was a factor, Sharrow does have at least one drunken driving conviction and a second previous drunken driving charge. Police have uncovered no connection between Sharrow and Parkhurst, who was reportedly trying to close a gate on the field to prevent Sharrow from fleeing the scene when he was hit. He died en route to the hospital.

"The president is not and has not been under investigation for obstruction." He went on to clarify: "The tweet from the president was in response to the five anonymous sources purportedly leaking info to the Washington Post," he said. "He's not afraid of the investigation—there is no investigation. There is not an investigation of the President of the United States, period." Appearing on the same show, Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that his panel's investigation into possible Russian meddling in the election "is going to move forward. We are going to get the full truth out there. I believe this is the best thing that could happen for the president." Trump surrogate Newt Gingrich, meanwhile, acknowledged that the boss' tweets weren't helping. "Trump has a compulsion to counterattack, and he’s very pugnacious," he told ABC’s This Week, via the Hill. "I don’t think it serves him well. I don’t think it helped him." Gingrich has a new book out, Understanding Trump, in which he claims that before launching his candidacy, Trump likened the cost of a presidential campaign to that of a yacht, but "a lot more fun."

Original Story:  – There's a perfectly understandable reason for Ozzy Osbourne's affair with hairdresser Michelle Pugh, Osbourne's rep tells People: "Over the last six years, Ozzy Osbourne has been dealing with a sex addiction," the rep says in a statement. "He is sorry if Ms. Pugh took their sexual relationship out of context. He would like to apologize to the other women he has been having sexual relationships with. Out of the bad comes good. Since his relationship with Ms. Pugh was exposed, Ozzy has gone into intense therapy." (Last week, Ozzy went on Good Morning America to reveal that their marriage is getting "back on track," while Sharon confirmed on The Talk that they were working things out.) On The Talk Wednesday, Sharon "tearfully" said how proud she is of Ozzy for working on his "embarrassing" problem, People reports. Pugh, however, disagrees with the rep's assessment of her affair with Osbourne. "When I say he gave me the greatest love of my life, I mean it," she tells People in her first interview about the affair. "He made me feel like the most beautiful and worshipped woman in the world." She says that Ozzy first pursued her in 2012 and that he was "unhappy" in his marriage. She also insists their romance was about more than just sex, and that he was her "best friend": "My relationship was more with this really nice, sweet, funny and cool guy ... John from England," she says. She confirms the two are no longer in touch. Meanwhile, Pugh is suing the Osbournes' daughter Kelly for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and public disclosure of public facts, E! reports. As you may remember, Kelly tweeted out Pugh's phone number back in May.

Original Story:  – CNN was widely criticized for hiring a former Trump campaign manager as a commentator back in June. So you can imagine the reaction now that it appears the network may have actually hired a current Trump strategy consultant. The Washington Post reports FEC filings from the Trump campaign show Corey Lewandowski was paid $20,000 by the campaign in August for "strategy consulting." It was the second monthly payment Lewandowski received from the Trump campaign since being fired in June, according to the New York Times. CNN described the first payment as "severance." The Trump campaign claims this second payment was also severance. But it didn't respond when asked why both payments are listed as consulting instead. CNN and Lewandowski refused to comment. The Trump campaign says Lewandowski will continue to receive severance payments through the end of the year. If Lewandowski is indeed still a paid consultant for Trump, it would represent a conflict of interest typically seen as unethical in journalism. Mediaite reports Lewandowski was pulled from a scheduled appearance on CNN's New Day on Wednesday after news of the most recent payment broke. It also originally reported he had been suspended by CNN, but the network denies it.

Original Story:  – Only two Republican electors voted against Donald Trump in the Electoral College Monday—but that was two too many for leading Republicans in Texas, where both of the "faithless" GOP electors hail from. The Hill reports that moments after the vote, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted that he was looking forward to signing a bill that would require electors to follow the state's popular votes. "This charade is over," he said. "A bill is already filed to make these commitments binding." One "faithless" Texas elector, Bill Greene, voted for Ron Paul, while the other, Christopher Suprun, voted for John Kasich. Trump's final margin was 304 to 227 for Hillary Clinton. The New York Times reports that his electoral college win ranks 46th out of 58 electoral college margins in US history. "I consider Mr. Trump still to be a demagogue. He continues to divide us based on whether or not you're male or female, and if you're a female, are you a 4 or a 10; where you worship; the color of your skin," Suprun tells the Austin American-Statesman. A total of five Democratic electors, four in Washington state and one in Hawaii, voted against Hillary Clinton, bringing the total number of faithless electors to a record seven, Politico reports. Three of the Washington electors backed Colin Powell and the fourth chose Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American activist. The Hawaiian elector voted for Bernie Sanders. The previous record was set in 1808, with six faithless electors. There could have been even more this time around, but election officials blocked electors in several states when they attempted to buck their party's nominee.

Injected Summary:  Two Republican electors in Texas voted against Donald Trump in the Electoral College, leading to calls for a bill to be passed to make elector commitments binding. One elector voted for Ron Paul, while the other voted for John Kasich. Trump won the Electoral College with a margin of 304 to 227, which ranks 46th out of 58 electoral college margins in US history. One of the faithless electors, Christopher Suprun, described Trump as a demagogue who divides people based on gender, race, and religion. A total of seven faithless electors voted against their party's nominee, including four in Washington state who backed Colin Powell and a Native American activist, and one in Hawaii who voted for Bernie Sanders.

Original Story:  – Knee-jerk reactions to Mitch McConnell's surprise debt ceiling proposal weren't good: Newt Gingrich, for example, called it "an irresponsible surrender to big government." But upon further consideration, many are coming out of the woodwork to explain why this is actually a grand plan for the Grand Ol' Party: McConnell is basically formalizing the idea that "the debt ceiling is used to embarrass the party in power, but it’s not allowed to threaten the American economy," writes Ezra Klein in the Washington Post. If it passes, it will be "easier for the minority party to embarrass the majority party, but harder for them to threaten the economy. It’s win-win." Plus, it ensures that President Obama doesn't "win" the issue by becoming "the great Compromiser-in-Chief." Also in the Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin thinks the problem is that "the chattering class" simply doesn't understand McConnell's proposal. The truth is, McConnell came up with "a mechanism to force Obama to put up cuts, send them to Congress and face 'default' if the president’s cuts don't get through," she writes. "In the process he makes 34 Democratic senators vote over and over again on cuts." In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal declares that McConnell is not selling out his party. "The debt ceiling is going to be increased one way or another, and the only question has been what, if anything, Republicans could get in return. If Mr. Obama insists on a tax increase, and Republicans won't vote for one, then what's the alternative to Mr. McConnell's maneuver?" But Erick Erickson at RedState.com is not convinced, calling the plan the "Pontius Pilate Pass the Buck Act of 2011" and urging people to send McConnell weasels "as testament to his treachery."
Original Summary:  Mitch McConnell's proposal to reform the debt ceiling has received mixed reactions. Some, like Newt Gingrich, have criticized it as an irresponsible surrender to big government. However, others, such as Ezra Klein and Jennifer Rubin, see it as a clever move that would make it easier for the minority party to embarrass the majority party while also forcing President Obama to put up cuts. The Wall Street Journal also supports McConnell's plan, arguing that the debt ceiling is going to be increased anyway and this is the best way for Republicans to get something in return. However, Erick Erickson at RedState.com is skeptical of the plan, calling it the "Pontius Pilate Pass the Buck Act of 2011" and urging people to hold McConnell accountable for his actions.

Original Story:  – Did Mitt Romney pay no taxes for 10 years, as Harry Reid has been alleging? Well, the Obama campaign doesn't know, but it certainly implies that's a possibility in its latest ad. "Did Romney pay 10% in taxes? Five percent? Zero? We don't know," says the ad's narrator. "But we do know that Romney personally approved over $70 million in fictional losses to the IRS as part of the notorious Son of Boss tax scandal, one of the largest tax avoidance schemes in history." That last claim refers to what ABC News refers to as six years' worth of "complicated tax avoidance measures" taken by the Marriott hotel company while Romney chaired its audit committee in the 1990s. But the Romney campaign says the ad's allegations are exaggerated, "dishonorable and dishonest." In another new ad, the Obama campaign fires back at a recent Romney ad assertion that Obama plans to end welfare's work requirements, Politico reports. The Obama ad cites a number of emphatic rebuttals of Romney's claim, including the New York Times calling it "blatantly false."

Original Story:  – A grieving family is accusing Chicago cops of attempting to cover up the murder of their 18-year-old son after the police department released nine videos Friday showing the final moments of Paul O'Neal's life, the Los Angeles Times reports. O'Neal was driving what police say was a stolen car when officers opened fire on the car in the middle of a neighborhood on July 28. O'Neal got out of the car and ran; an officer chased after him and shot him in the back when he didn't stop. According to WLS, the body camera of the officer who shot O'Neal wasn't functioning. It's unclear why. But the cameras of other officers arriving on the scene were rolling. One officer called O'Neal a "bitch-ass motherfucker" as he was bleeding on the ground, Vox reports. Another yelled "Why did you have to shoot at us?" O'Neal didn't have a gun and hadn't shot at officers. None of the officers attempted to give aid to O'Neal. The videos also show officers talking about how the media will react and what will happen to them. "I'm going to be fucking crucified," says one. Chicago's head of police oversight calls the videos "shocking and disturbing." Three officers have already had their police powers removed, and O'Neal's family is suing. "These police officers decided to play judge, jury, and executioner," the family's lawyer tells the Times.

Original Story:  – And you thought your workday was long. Six years after a rule change limited first-year medical residents from working shifts longer than 16 hours, the rule has been changed back, KQED reports. According to NPR, as of July, first-year doctors could once again work shifts lasting up to 28 hours without a break. Shifts for first-year residents were cut to 16 hours by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in 2011 after studies showed that human performance starts to decline and medical errors go up after 16 hours. But the ACGME reversed its decision in March, arguing the shorter shifts didn't improve patient outcomes and created a new set of problems. Veteran doctors argued the shorter shifts made first-year residents focus on handing off patients rather than seeing them through treatment, prevented residents from observing treatments and surgeries from beginning to end, and gave them less time to teach residents. One doctor tells Forbes that patients want to know "you are the doctor taking care of them" and won't be replaced by someone else. But not everyone wanted to see the return of longer shifts, which was opposed by both resident and patient groups. The director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group accuses the ACGME of letting "their misguided wishes trump public health." And one first-year resident says veteran doctors only want 28-hour shifts because they feel that "I went through it, so therefore you have to." (Swedish city's six-hour workday didn't work.)
Original Summary:  The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has reversed its 2011 rule limiting first-year medical residents to 16-hour shifts, allowing them to work up to 28 hours without a break. This change comes after six years of the previous rule, which was implemented to prevent resident fatigue and improve patient safety. However, some critics argue that the return of longer shifts will lead to a decrease in patient care and safety. Veteran doctors have expressed concerns that shorter shifts make it difficult for first-year residents to gain hands-on experience and properly care for patients. One doctor believes that patients want to know their doctor is fully present and available to them, rather than being replaced by a colleague after a 16-hour shift.

Original Story:  – Ted Cruz claims Donald Trump's "reaction to everything is to throw a fit, to engage in insults." On Wednesday, however, the insults were coming mainly from Cruz himself. Six biggies: At a town hall in New Hampshire, Cruz managed to turn nearly every answer into a critique of his rival. "Donald told us every day for a year he was going to win Iowa, win it big, win it 'yuuuuuge,'" he said, per Politico. "I don't think people are interested in temper tantrums, or you could call it a 'Trumpertantrum.'" Earlier Wednesday, Cruz said his young daughters "are better behaved" than Trump ... ... who might suddenly get angry and "nuke Denmark" if elected president, per NBC News. When a town-hall audience member asked about Sarah Palin accusing the Cruz campaign of "dirty tricks," echoing similar words from Trump, Cruz responded: "If you spend too much time with Donald Trump, strange things happen to people." When protesters interrupted Cruz as he spoke about the "pseudo-science" behind climate change, he said it seemed "these children attended the Donald Trump-style school of debate." And when he was asked about an undisclosed loan he received while running for Senate, Cruz said that "Heidi and I did something that is very novel and unfamiliar to Donald: We paid it back." He then suggested Trump might owe "billions of dollars." (Of course, Trump spent Wednesday tweeting about how Cruz "illegally stole" Iowa.)

Original Story:  – For the first time, the Pentagon has acknowledged that one of the thousands of airstrikes the US-led anti-ISIS coalition has carried out since last August probably killed civilians. After a monthslong investigation, Central Command released a statement saying two children were "likely" killed in a November strike in Syria targeting the Khorasan group, reports the Guardian, which notes that the US has long denied causing any civilian casualties during the campaign in Iraq and Syria. "We regret the unintentional loss of lives," the operation's commander said in the statement, adding that the coalition continues to "take all reasonable measures during the targeting process to mitigate risks to non-combatants." Officials say the military is investigating another report of civilian casualties in Syria and two from Iraq, though a defense official tells the Washington Post that the lack of US troops on the ground makes it hard to verify airstrike deaths. A Pentagon spokeswoman says a total of 46 reports of civilian casualties have been examined since August, of which 35 were dismissed because they were deemed not credible or because there was no evidence, the BBC reports. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights activist group says coalition strikes have killed 131 civilians, 42 of them children, along with more than 2,200 ISIS fighters and hundreds of militants from other groups. The Pentagon also announced yesterday that it's sending 2,000 antitank weapons to Iraqi forces to help them counter the suicide car bomb tactics that helped ISIS seize Ramadi last week, the Post reports. And ISIS now has more vehicles: The AP reported earlier this week that Iraqi troops abandoned dozens of US-supplied military vehicles when they fled Ramadi, including around half a dozen tanks.

A scuffle apparently ensued as security moved to remove Southall, cell phone video was recorded, and Southall emerged saying that he had been roughed up considerably as well as been called racial slurs. A woman in the video shouts repeatedly, "don't choke him!" "I got punched in the face, I got punched in the neck. I got kicked in the chest. Kicked in the stomach. Somebody stepped on my hand," Southall tells CNN. A Trump rep on Saturday said "the campaign does not condone this behavior," but Trump himself appeared less apologetic in comments Sunday, per CNN. Southall "was so obnoxious and so loud, he was screaming. I had 10,000 people in the room yesterday, 10,000 people, and this guy started screaming by himself and they—I don't know, rough up, he should have been—maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing," Trump said. Southall, for his part, says he intends to press charges.

Original Story:  – Word has it that the pope told a woman in Argentina it was OK to take communion, even though she was married to a man who'd been divorced. The reports have prompted questions about whether the Catholic Church is changing its teachings on the matter—but the Vatican says it was a personal call and "consequences relating to the teaching of the church are not to be inferred." As NPR recounts, Jacquelina Lisbona had written to the pope seeking clarification on whether she was eligible for communion. The pope called Lisbona, her husband tells CNN, and "said she was absolved of all sins and she could go and get the Holy Communion because she was not doing anything wrong." According to the Daily Mail, the pope's call came seven months after the letter; he apologized for the lateness and said her question was one "that we are discussing at the Vatican, because a divorced person who takes communion is not doing any harm." More from the church: While the Vatican says the call occurred, the conversation "is between the pope and the woman," says a spokesman, via CNN. "The magisterium of the church is not defined by personal phone calls." The church is preparing for some serious crowds this Sunday as popes John Paul II and John XXIII are canonized, NPR reports. Rome's mayor says the city can cope, but a tour manager isn't so sure. "In a city which is nearly 2,800 years old and with a population—some say 2.5, some say 4 million—if 3 million people are coming in a city like this, there will problems without doubts." St. Peter's Square and its surroundings can handle some 250,000, a Vatican spokesman says.
Original Summary:  The Pope reportedly called a woman in Argentina and told her it was okay to take communion despite being married to a divorced man. The Vatican clarified that the call was a personal decision and does not imply a change in church teachings.

Original Story:  – "I can't get into the mind of a psychopath." The line from Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo about Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock may reflect conventional wisdom, but the term "psychopath" may be getting used too loosely, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The newspaper interviews a psychology professor and other experts who say that Paddock doesn't seem to fit the criteria. For one thing, psychopaths are impulsive, and police have made clear that Paddock's attack Sunday night had been meticulously planned. Paddock also kept in touch with family members and had a girlfriend, traits at odds with the classic picture of a psychopath as a cold loner. In the story, one former FBI profiler suggests a simple if macabre motive: "Paddock may have fantasized becoming the greatest mass murderer ever." But that still doesn't explain what prompted Paddock to move from fantasy into reality. Another former FBI agent wonders if some childhood trauma, perhaps related to Paddock's father being a bank robber sought by the FBI, finally bubbled to surface. Meanwhile, Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, has told FBI investigators that he seemed to exhibit symptoms of mental health troubles, reports NBC News. "She said he would lie in bed, just moaning and screaming, 'Oh, my God,'" one agency official tells the network.

Original Story:  – A celebrated neuroscientist known for her work on human empathy is now being called a workplace bully who can reduce colleagues to tears, the Cut reports. Tania Singer, director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, has taken a sabbatical to "calm the situation down," her employer says. Meanwhile, eight current and former colleagues are telling Science things like: "People were terrified," or "Whenever anyone had a meeting with her there was at least an even chance they would come out in tears." One complaint is that Singer was particularly hard on the Institute's postdoc or PhD students who got pregnant, accusing them of being "irresponsible." Bethany Kok, the one source who went on record, says Singer was initially kind about her twin pregnancy—but screamed at her the next day, and when Kok miscarried a child, Singer emailed her saying that "she wasn't paying me to go to the doctor." Colleagues also called Singer a charming visionary who can make projects happen, but say she micro-managed them and became difficult when shown data that clashed with her theories. An advocate for meditation, Singer helped found the field of social neuroscience and may be best-known for a 2004 study that showed how watching loved ones in pain activates the same brain areas as feeling actual pain. She will return to the Institute in 2019 when the current crop of students has left, her boss says.

Original Story:  – In a late-night development, Sen. Chuck Grassley revealed that two men have told the Senate Judiciary Committee they were the ones who had the alleged 1982 encounter with Christine Blasey Ford. The details are scarce and come via a news release issued by Grassley, reports USA Today, which notes "it's unknown whether the men's claims are being taken seriously." Neither man was named and BuzzFeed News notes the release gave no indication of whether the committee would follow up further with the men. The first was interviewed Monday and Tuesday, and on Wednesday provided "a more in-depth written statement." The second man "explained his recollection of the details of the encounter" on Wednesday as well. More: Politico separately reports on an ex-boyfriend's accusation that third accuser Julie Swetnick is "not credible at all. Not at all." That man, Richard Vinneccy, filed for a restraining order against Swetnick on March 1, 2001, claiming that after their four-year relationship ended she threatened his wife and child. The case was dismissed two weeks later. When asked about it, Swetnick attorney Michael Avenatti called it "complete nonsense" and described Vinneccy as the problematic one. "Her ex-boyfriend fraudulently used her resume to apply for and obtain jobs and was caught by her. Why are you all attacking a sexual assault victim? Would that be appropriate in a court of law?" The Wall Street Journal digs into Swetnick's background and reports that she worked as an agent for New York Life Insurance from 2006 to 2008. She filed a sexual-harassment complaint against the company that ultimately earned her a financial settlement. She was repped by Debra Katz's firm; Katz is now representing Ford.

Original Story:  – People who suffer from depression but are happily in love—perhaps an odd combination—may want to think twice about popping certain antidepressants, LiveScience reports. In a new study, researchers gave two kinds of antidepressants to 192 people who were depressed but in healthy relationships for at least seven months. "Indeed, our subjects were those who could be properly considered smitten by love," says study author Hagop Akiskal. The participants—69 men and 123 women, with a mean age of 41—filled out questionnaires saying how their feelings of attraction, attachment, and love toward their partner changed after taking the drugs. What they found: Participants taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were more likely to be uncomfortable with "sharing their partners' thoughts and feelings," reports LiveScience, and less hopeful that their love would endure, than those taking taking the other kind—tricyclic antidepressants. Men taking SSRIs were less inclined to ask for advice or help from their partners than women taking SSRIs. Women taking tricyclic antidepressants saw more negative effects on their sex lives than men taking the same drug. "The good news is that there are a variety of agents for treating depression," says Akiskal. Meanwhile, antidepressant consumption has been rising worldwide for the past decade, reports the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in an article that looks at who is using the drugs and why. Teenagers in the US, however, are taking fewer antidepressants—perhaps too few—since an FDA warning about possible suicide risks in 2004, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reports. (But here's some good news for pregnant women taking antidepressants.)

Original Story:  – Republicans have a serious Latino-voter problem, and fixing it could spark a painful public debate that wrenches the party in two, writes Patrik Jonsson at the Christian Science Monitor. Latinos played a big role in reelecting President Obama, comprising 10% of voters and backing him by 71%. But if the Republicans embrace that bloc by granting amnesty to more than 10 million illegal immigrants, then middle-class, conservative whites are going to freak, Jonsson writes. The move would contradict decades of anti-immigration policy and fly in the face of working-class anger over perceived "handouts" to illegal immigrants. Nonetheless, conservatives like Sean Hannity and Charles Krauthammer are testing the waters by supporting the notion of amnesty with a secured border. For now, Latinos remain suspicious of the GOP's attitudes, writes Jonsson—especially after conservative legislatures in the south and west waged such vocal battles against illegal immigrants.

Original Story:  – Roger Stone has been suspended from Twitter—and he says it's a move that the site will bitterly regret. "They will soon learn they have bitten off more than they can chew," the outspoken President Trump ally tells New York. Stone says he plans to bring an antitrust case against Twitter, and he knows "a little bit about generating publicity." "I am advised I have a very strong legal case," he says. "Twitter wants to avoid being regulated like a utility. No one has been willing to file the antitrust case. I am." Stone—whose suspension now appears to be permanent, not temporary as initially thought—was kicked off the site Saturday, the day after he launched a tirade against CNN anchors and other journalists, calling Don Lemon an "ignorant lying covksucker [sic]." Stone tells Politico that the "battle against free speech has just begun." "This is a strange way to do business and part and parcel of the systematic effort by the tech left to censor and silence conservative voices," he says, adding that Twitter seems "unconcerned" by "threats to kill my wife, my family, my children, and even my dogs." (Earlier this year, Stone said any politician who voted to impeach Trump would "endanger their own life.")

Stone has been a vocal critic of Twitter's efforts to censor conservative voices and believes the platform's actions are part of a systematic effort to silence him. He has also expressed concerns about threats to his family and pets made on the platform.

"They will soon learn they have bitten off more than they can chew," the outspoken President Trump ally tells New York. Stone says he plans to bring an antitrust case against Twitter, and he knows "a little bit about generating publicity." "I am advised I have a very strong legal case," he says. "Twitter wants to avoid being regulated like a utility. No one has been willing to file the antitrust case. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. I am." Stone—whose suspension now appears to be permanent, not temporary as initially thought—was kicked off the site Saturday, the day after he launched a tirade against CNN anchors and other journalists, calling Don Lemon an "ignorant lying covksucker [sic]. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars." Stone tells Politico that the "battle against free speech has just begun." "This is a strange way to do business and part and parcel of the systematic effort by the tech left to censor and silence conservative voices," he says, adding that Twitter seems "unconcerned" by "threats to kill my wife, my family, my children, and even my dogs." (Earlier this year, Stone said any politician who voted to impeach Trump would "endanger their own life.")

Original Story:  – Chris Brown didn't voluntarily leave anger management rehab this week, he was chucked out for being too angry, it emerged at a probation hearing in Los Angeles yesterday. The singer, who voluntarily checked himself into the Malibu facility after last month's assault arrest in Washington, DC, was ordered to leave after he threw a rock at his mother's car, smashing a window, according to a probation report obtained by TMZ. She was at the facility for a family session and Brown was infuriated by her suggestion that he stay there for extended treatment. The judge in Los Angeles—where Brown is still on probation for beating up then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009—ordered the singer to spend 90 days in a live-in anger management rehab program at a court-approved facility, reports the Los Angeles Times. During the 90 days, he will be required to complete three days of community service every week and to submit to drug tests. "There is much concern with the probationer's new arrest and his violent outburst that resulted in his discharge from a treatment facility," the probation report states. Brown will be allowed to travel to Washington, DC, for legal proceedings relating to the new assault charge.

Original Story:  – Retired baseball player Curt Schilling discovered today that when it comes to retweeting Hitler memes, sometimes it's one strike and you're out. The New York Daily News reports ESPN removed Schilling from his gig covering the Little League World Series, and the former pitcher could face further punishments from the company, where he also serves as part of the broadcast team for Sunday Night Baseball. ESPN's reprimand comes on the heels of Schilling tweeting a (since-deleted) photo of Hitler that compared Muslims to Nazis. "Curt's tweet was completely unacceptable and in no way represents our company's perspective," reads a statement from ESPN. Schilling took his punishment in stride, tweeting, "100% my fault. Bad choices have bad consequences and this was a bad decision in every way on my part." The offending image claimed that 5% to 10% of Muslims are extremists and compared that to 7% of Germans who were Nazis. Slate points out that would mean there are between 80 million and 160 million "extremist" Muslims, which "seems like an arbitrary, hard-to-prove claim." Plus, many more people supported and participated in Nazism by serving in the army or electing Nazi leaders than were officially Nazis. Schilling and controversy often find each other. The Daily News reports he claimed his conservative views were keeping him out of the Hall of Fame earlier this year. (A few years ago, he was sued by Rhode Island after his video company failed.)
Original Summary:  Curt Schilling, a retired baseball player and ESPN commentator, was removed from his job covering the Little League World Series after tweeting a Hitler meme comparing Muslims to Nazis. ESPN issued a statement saying that Schilling's tweet was "completely unacceptable" and did not represent the company's perspective. Schilling apologized for his mistake, saying it was a "bad decision" and acknowledging that he made a "bad choice." The tweet was criticized for its inaccurate comparison of Muslims to Nazis, with some pointing out that the number of extremist Muslims is likely much lower than Schilling claimed. Schilling has a history of controversy, including being sued by Rhode Island over his video company and claiming that his conservative views are keeping him out of the Hall of Fame.

Original Story:  – A landslide at a tea plantation in Java has killed at least 5 people and left 60 others buried, according to police on Indonesia's main island. Villagers are digging through tons of mud with farm tools and their bare hands searching for survivors, the AP reports. Days of heavy rain have soaked the area south of Jakarta, leaving roads impassable. A cell phone tower was brought down in the landslide, further hampering the rescue effort. The region has been experiencing heavier rains than usual this year, causing floods that have forced hundreds from their homes. Deforestation in the area has stripped hillsides of their cover, increasing the risk and severity of landslides, the BBC notes.

Original Story:  – John Livingston was at home early Sunday in North Carolina when two deputies arrived looking for someone else—and a few minutes later Livingston was dead. What happened is the subject of a state investigation, but witnesses say the 33-year-old father of three was Maced or pepper sprayed, Tased, dragged outside, and shot several times by the deputies. "They shot the wrong guy for the wrong thing," a neighbor tells the Fayetteville Observer. "Wrong guy. Wrong house. Wrong everything." According to Livingston's roommate, Clayton Carroll, the deputies showed up at around 3:30am looking for a guy who didn't live there anymore, WNCN reports. Livingston shut the door and told them they needed a search warrant—which is when "the cop kicked in the door, got on top of him, started slinging him around [and] beat him," Carroll says. According to Carroll, Livingston struggled with a deputy's Taser, and when the fight continued outside Livingston was riddled with six bullets. One deputy was lightly injured, WRAL reports. The killing occurred in a pretty bleak area of Cumberland County that has roads with potholes and mobile homes that are abandoned, burnt, or gutted. Authorities aren't commenting, but both officers were placed on administrative leave and one was named: Nicholas Kehagias (usually the shooting officer's name is released, the Observer notes). As for Livingston, he "was the greatest father you could imagine," says Jessika Cardwell, the mother of his children. "So kind-hearted. All the kids around here loved him. John had the best personality. Where he went, he would light up the party." (Read about a crime scene photographer who made a shocking discovery.)

Original Story:  – Egypt’s military installed a new prime minister today, as crowds gathered in Tahrir Square for another big protest. The new prime minister, Kamal Ganzouri, has held the job once before, from 1996 to 1999. Though he reportedly had a falling out with the Mubarak regime, protesters still instantly rejected the 81-year-old, shouting “We don’t want him,” reports Al Jazeera reports (see video). “The security council wants someone they can control, and Ganzouri is their man,” one protester told CNN. Ganzouri will hold power until at least January, when a new parliament, selected in the upcoming election, is sworn in. His appointment comes a few days after the previous prime minister and his government quit. Protests calmed down yesterday after soldiers erected a barbed-wire barrier to separate them from police, but protesters are planning to make themselves heard today, in what’s been billed as a “last chance” event. A Guardian reporter says the crowd is now about 15,000 strong.

Original Story:  – After more than two months, a man has been charged in a killing that shook the University of Wisconsin-Stout community. Cullen Osborn, a 27-year-old from Minneapolis, has been charged with felony murder and battery in the beating death of Saudi student Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram reports. The 24-year-old Alnahdi died Oct. 31, the day after police found him unconscious and bleeding outside a pizza restaurant in Menomonie around 2am. Witnesses said he had been beaten during an altercation with a tall white man. The death led to increased police patrols amid fears it could have been a hate crime. Police, however, said during the investigation that they do not believe this was a hate crime, and a criminal complaint unveiled late Thursday states that Osburn insisted the incident had nothing to do with anybody's race, NBC reports. Witnesses gave police varying accounts of the confrontation between the men, though more than one said that Osborn was behaving aggressively and appeared to have started an argument with Alnahdi. "I hope this arrest brings some measure of peace and comfort to Hussain's family in Saudi Arabia," UW-Stout Chancellor Bob Meyer said in a statement Friday. After Alnahdi's death, the community offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to his assailant.

Original Story:  – A Scottish tourist says he was just trying not to spill his drink while at a Dubai bar, and he'll spend time in jail for it. The BBC reports Jamie Harron, 27, was handed a 3-month sentence for touching a man's hip, something Harron says happened while he was walking with a drink in the crowded Rock Bottom Cafe on July 15; he says he put out his hand "to avoid impact" with a patron, but the incident led to a public indecency charge. Though the BBC reports the man whose hip Harron brushed dropped the complaint (the Guardian is less firm on this point, and says there are no court records to back this up), prosecutors went ahead with the case. The group Detained in Dubai has been championing Harron's cause and complaining about what it sees as deficiencies in his defense, including "key witnesses" who were not asked to testify. It says an appeal is planned, "though this will prolong his increasingly difficult circumstances in Dubai, and compound the enormous financial losses he has suffered as a consequence of the ongoing case." The group's CEO adds that his family hasn't been able to be by his side, as "they faced a very real risk of imprisonment themselves under the UAE's cybercrime laws which forbid criticism of the government." Harron, an electrician, stopped off in Dubai for a couple days en route to a job in Afghanistan. The Guardian reports Harron's court ordeal isn't over, as he still faces additional charges related to drinking alcohol and allegedly swearing at the man he brushed up against.

Original Story:  – From Sen. Susan Collins to Herbert Hoover's great-granddaughter, leading conservative women are stumped by the GOP's recent record on women's issues, writes one of their leading voices. Instead of treating women as equals, top Republican men see them as "totemic and unknowable," notes Kathleen Parker at Newsweek; in short, "they don't 'get' women." Between Todd Akin's comments, Paul Ryan's support for a "human life amendment," and the party platform, Republicans are looking "suicidal," and Democrats are loving it. Margaret Hoover can't figure it out, wondering how "this minority of representatives are in such positions of power that are so out of step with the majority of Republicans." Polls show she's right: For instance, some 77% of women feel birth control "shouldn't be part of the national debate," while 66% of self-described pro-lifers say abortion should be up to women, not the government. But at CNN, GOP Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison defends her party. She cautions against an oversimplification of women as a bloc: One's gender doesn't define one's political positions, and no one party is better suited to women, she writes, citing her decades-long record fighting for her gender.

Despite this, some GOP lawmakers, such as Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, are defending their party's record and cautioning against oversimplifying women's political views based on their gender.

Original Story:  – Dispatchers in Okanogan, Wash., received an unusual call right around lunchtime Thursday: A woman phoned to say she was perched 30 feet up in a tree near a local campground, with wolves hovering at the bottom and waiting for her to come down, the AP reports. The research student said she'd been surveying the area when she saw the wolves; the tree seemed her best possible escape. Deputies sent to assist her were told they could shoot the wolves on sight if they were still at the tree's base, authorities tell KREM, but apparently that wasn't necessary: A Department of Natural Resources helicopter was able to land and save the student. The local sheriff says his office is looking into whether the wolves have a den there and if they'll pose future threats to other people wandering in the area.

Original Story:  – The House will reject a Senate-approved plan to extend the payroll tax cut for two months, John Boehner said at a news conference today. The House's plan: to call for immediate negotiations on a yearlong extension that could create "certainty for people who are trying to create jobs," the speaker said, adding that he doesn't "believe the differences between the House and Senate are that great." The Washington Post reports that the House plans to reject the deal tomorrow. A White House rep said Boehner had been cowed by the Tea Party. But Boehner said he had "raised concerns about the two-month process from the moment I heard about it." Now, he's urging senators to "put their vacations on hold" to go back to the negotiating table. Obama has said repeatedly Congress should not quit for the year until the tax cut has been extended, the AP notes.

Original Story:  – The man found lying on his back on a patch of grass on the outskirts of Manchester on Dec. 12, 2015, dead of strychnine poisoning, has finally been identified thanks to an international police investigation. Police believe that the man, identified as 67-year-old David Lytton, took his own life, reports the BBC. He'd arrived in the UK via a flight two days prior from Lahore, Pakistan, though he turns out to be English, and his ties to the area remain unknown. Having been found with no ID on him, police initially revealed what they did know: The man had walked into a pub in Greefield, Saddleworth, in the late afternoon on the 11th, and asked for directions to the "top of the mountain," referring to the nearby Indian's Head peak. He was only wearing light clothing and slip-on shoes. The Guardian reports on a key clue: An autopsy found that that a serious injury to the man's left leg was repaired with a titanium plate exclusively used by a dozen hospitals in Pakistan. Speculating that he could have entered the country from Pakistan, police checked passenger records from dozens of flights from Lahore in the days before his death. They came across a name; an old passport image suggested they were on the right track. A British relative was located and gave a DNA sample, and it matched. Lytton had lived in Pakistan for a decade, and was known as "a bit of a loner" who "liked his own company." Police are still investigating why Lytton chose to visit Saddleworth. Strychnine, used to kill rodents, is more readily available in Pakistan. (This 44-year-old's death in a posh London suburb remains shrouded in mystery.)

Original Story:  – Jon Stewart doesn't have a national forum anymore, but he got a chance to rip into Donald Trump at a charity event Tuesday night for Stand Up for Heroes, which benefits veterans. Here's a sampling, per Entertainment Weekly, CNN, and USA Today: "I thought when a guy got off a bus and says, 'I'm going to grab her on the [expletive deleted],' then OK, we're done. The election is over. Usually that is a signifier that we don't have to pay attention anymore." "I played soccer; we do say terrible things to each other, 'I'm gonna (expletive) that girl, whatever. But when people cross a certain line, (the feeling in the locker room becomes) 'We're all being disgusting, but I'm pretty sure that's a crime.'" He recalled an old Twitter fight in which Trump called him out for changing his name from Jonathan Leibowitz. “This is when I realized he was trying to point out that I was a Jew. I always thought my face did that.” "To be here tonight with you guys, my heroes, on the eve of the last American election is so exciting. I'm not in the game anymore. I'm not as much of a political analyst... but if I could ask you a question that I've been saying to my television, it's 'What the [expletive deleted]? What the [expletive deleted] is going on?

Original Story:  – A death row inmate in Alabama is out of prison after 15 years, 50 days, becoming the second such convict to walk in the state this month. William Ziegler, initially convicted of the 2000 murder of Russell Allen Baker in Mobile County, pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting murder in a plea deal with prosecutors yesterday. He was sentenced to time served and allowed to leave a free man, AL.com reports. Just five months ago prosecutors had indicated they would again seek the death penalty for Ziegler, 39, who won a new trial in 2012 in a post-appeal challenge. In her ruling on that challenge, Circuit Judge Sarah Stewart highlighted three issues: a juror who lied about his views on the death penalty during jury selection; evidence that was withheld by the state regarding a witness who eventually retracted her testimony; and a poor job done by Ziegler's lawyers. The assistant attorney general wouldn't discuss what spawned the plea deal, which required Ziegler to admit that his actions led to Baker's stabbing death. Ziegler and three accomplices were convicted after Baker's body was found in a wooded area near Ziegler's home and police discovered the pair had fought at a party, the New York Daily News reports. Ziegler is "a menace to our society," says the victim's aunt. "This is not justice for our nephew." Though happy her son is free, Ziegler's mother says her son "was put in a position again" and "had no choice but to go ahead and plead to a murder he did not commit." AL.com notes it likely would have been at least a year before his case went to trial, and Ziegler himself tells WKRG, "I took that deal for one reason and one reason only and that was to go home ... I maintain my innocence to this day."

Original Story:  – Goodbye metal fencing, hello glass walls: Paris authorities are building a permanent security belt around the Eiffel Tower, replacing the current fencing around it with more visually appealing bulletproof glass walls, reports the AP. The company operating France's most-visited monument says see-through panels are being set up at the north and south ends of the site. Each panel, made from over 2.36-inch thick armored glass, measures nearly 10 feet high and weighs 1.5 tons. In all, 450 glass panels will compose the two walls north and south of the monument. Two graphic grids have been erected on the two other sides of the site and bollards against vehicle ramming attacks will be set up all around. The president of the Société d'Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel, which runs the monument, described the new walls as "rock-solid for absolute security," per the BBC. French soldiers and police will keep patrolling outside and inside the area, as they have done since the deadly November 2015 attacks in the French capital. The glass walls being installed allow visitors to admire the views from the nearby Champ-de-Mars gardens to the other side of the Seine River that cuts through Paris. The renovation is part of a $350 million project announced last year to modernize the 129-year-old tower. The security renovation should be completed by September. "When you are on site, you see that the 3-meter high walls, compared to the scale of the monument, are absolutely not visible," said Jose Luis Fuentes, one of the architects in charge of the project. "It will really look as if the square (under the Eiffel Tower) was open." Between 6 and 7 million people visit the Eiffel Tower every year. The Eiffel Tower hasn’t always been so popular, according to NPR. Early critics called it a "truly tragic street lamp," a "carcass waiting to be fleshed out with freestone or brick," and "a half-built factory pipe."

Original Story:  – The ancient Greek city of Bargylia in modern-day Turkey is on the market and could be yours for just $8 million, reports MNN. Located 19 miles from Bodrum on 300 acres overlooking the Gulf of Güllük, the property includes a theatre, fortification walls, acropolis, and necropolis, according to the Greek City Times. The property dates back to the first century BC and was founded in honor of the mythical Bargylos, who was mortally wounded by the winged horse Pegasus. Bargylia has never been officially excavated so no one is certain what artifacts might be lurking there, but treasure hunters can be heard looting the property at night. The area has been privately owned since 1927 and is currently classified as a Grade 1 archaeological site, so it’s off-limits for development, but that classification could be changed. Turkey is hoping that selling the property to a responsible owner will help protect it from theft and decay. Locals hope that Greece’s Culture and Tourism Ministry will step in and rescue the parcel. The site was up for sale in 2015, and at the time it was described as "a first-degree archeological site, facing the Bird Heaven Lake near the Bogazici Village, with full sea and lake view," according to the Lonely Planet. The price has been reduced by $2 million, so you could say that it's dirt cheap.

Original Story:  – The "Don't Say Gay" bill is back—and it's got a whole new clause sure to spark controversy. Tennessee state Sen. Stacey Campfield has introduced a revamped version of his "Classroom Protection Act," which forbids K-8 teachers from teaching anything that is "inconsistent with natural human reproduction," the Knoxville News Sentinel reports. To assuage fears that it would prevent teachers from counseling troubled students, it specifically excludes "answering in good faith" questions students ask. The issue? It requires that teachers report those conversations to parents. The bill provoked an instant backlash from liberal outlets. Blogs like Think Progress pointed out that gay youth are often afraid—sometimes with reason—that their family will reject them, and the Tennessee Equality Project warned that it would "erode the trust between students and counselors." But Campfield isn't convinced. "It's ridiculous to say we should shield parents from that information," he said, calling homosexuality "potentially dangerous or life-threatening." Incidentally, if Campfield's name sounds familiar, you might be remembering the time he asserted that AIDS was a result of "one guy screwing a monkey," or his new headline-grabbing bill that would cut off welfare from parents based on their kids' grades.
Original Summary:  A new version of the "Dont Say Gay" bill has been introduced in Tennessee, which would prohibit K-8 teachers from teaching anything inconsistent with natural human reproduction. The bill specifically excludes counseling sessions from the ban, but requires teachers to report any conversations they have with students about sexual orientation to parents. The bill has sparked controversy and criticism from LGBTQ+ advocates, who argue that it could erode the trust between students and counselors and put vulnerable youth at risk of rejection by their families. The bill's author, Sen. Stacey Campfield, has defended the measure, claiming that homosexuality is potentially dangerous or life-threatening. This is not the first time Campfield has faced criticism for his views on LGBTQ+ issues, including previous comments about AIDS and a bill that would have penalized parents based on their children's grades.

Blogs like Think Progress pointed out that gay youth are often afraid—sometimes with reason—that their family will reject them, and the Tennessee Equality Project warned that it would "erode the trust between students and counselors." But Campfield isn't convinced. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. "It's ridiculous to say we should shield parents from that information," he said, calling homosexuality "potentially dangerous or life-threatening." Incidentally, if Campfield's name sounds familiar, you might be remembering the time he asserted that AIDS was a result of "one guy screwing a monkey," or his new headline-grabbing bill that would cut off welfare from parents based on their kids' grades.
Injected Summary:  The "Dont Say Gay" bill has been reintroduced in Tennessee with a new clause that requires teachers to report student questions about sexuality to parents. The bill, introduced by Sen. Stacey Campfield, aims to prevent teachers from promoting "inconsistent with natural human reproduction" material in the classroom. Critics argue that the bill will erode the trust between students and counselors and put vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth at risk of rejection by their families. Campfield has defended the bill, claiming that homosexuality is "potentially dangerous or life-threatening." The bill has sparked controversy and been met with opposition from liberal outlets and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups.

Original Story:  – It's the first quadruple murder the police department in Chester, New York, has ever investigated, as best Police Chief Peter Graziano can recall. The man suspected of doing the killings? A retired cop. Nicholas Tartaglione, formerly of the Briarcliff Manor PD, was arrested Monday; the 49-year-old is charged with killing four men in or around April 2016 while engaged in a conspiracy to distribute at least 5 kilograms of cocaine. On Tuesday, four people's remains were uncovered at a 170-acre property in Mount Hope that Tartaglione is renting. The Times Herald-Record described Tuesday's effort as a "massive evidence-gathering operation," comprised of more than three dozen police vehicles and two excavators. Martin Luna, Urbano Santiago, Miguel Luna, and Hector Gutierrez were captured on surveillance video between 2:30pm and 3pm on April 11. The men were seen getting out of a car outside a Chester diner, and the Journal-News reports that other than a 5pm phone conversation Miguel Luna had with a relative, the men haven't been heard from since. CBS New York reports prosecutors suspect the men were killed inside the Likquid Lounge, which sits in the same plaza and is owned by Tartaglione's brother. Authorities aren't saying how they zeroed in on Tartaglione, but do note that some of the missing men may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. Tartaglione has been receiving a $65,000 annual pension since he retired on disability in 2008, but recently applied for a spot with the Mount Vernon PD.

Original Story:  – Doctors had strange news for a 22-year-old Saudi man who came in complaining of a nosebleed or two every month: He had a half-inch mass of bone in his nose, LiveScience reports. After consulting with dentists, the doctors decided he had a tooth in his nasal cavity and extracted it under general anesthesia. No muss, no fuss: A published report found that the patient recovered and the nosebleeds were gone after three months. "It's an unusual case of an extra tooth—certainly, the most impressive intranasal photo I think I've ever seen of one," says John Hellstein, a dentist. Studies show that extra teeth aren't so uncommon—0.15% to 3.9% of people have them—but Hellstein says it's unusual to see one growing through the nasal floor. The man probably had a mesiodens, a typical extra tooth that grows around the incisors, says Hellstein. It's not clear what causes extra teeth, but the report points to causes like trauma, infection, and genetic factors, the Daily Mail reports. Rare as it is, an extra tooth in the nose can lead to symptoms like nasal deformities, smelly mucus, nosebleeds, and headaches. But don't expect to find one: "I've never seen the tooth actually in there," Hellstein says. (Read about a teenager who had 232 extra teeth removed from his head.)

Original Story:  – A Papa John's owner tried to make a buck off his employees' backs, and now he's paying big time. Abdul Jamil Khokhar, who owns nine of the chain's restaurants in the NYC area along with BMY Foods, has pleaded guilty to not paying the correct minimum wage when workers put in overtime, Fortune reports. He and BMY were also accused of filing false business records to make it appear as if other (i.e., fake) employees were actually working those extra hours so he wouldn't get nabbed for not paying the overtime, per a press release. The AP notes that about 300 current and ex-employees were affected. "Wage theft is a crime, and a Papa John's franchisee is now going to jail for cheating his employees and trying to cover it up," state AG Eric Schneiderman says. "My office will do everything in its power to ... make sure that all employers—including fast food restaurants—follow the law." The minimum wage in New York state is $8.75 per hour, with an increase to $9 per hour set to take effect Dec. 31, per the state Labor Department. And when workers put in more than 40 hours per week, they're supposed to be paid time-and-a-half. But, along with co-owner BMY Foods, Khokhar tried to game the system, paying his workers just their regular wages for overtime hours, then concocting ghost workers and filing fraudulent tax returns when he realized the US Labor Department was investigating him, the press release notes. A civil sentence laid out in July mandated that Khokhar cough up $230,000 in back pay for his workers, as well as $230,000 in damages and $50,000 in penalties, Consumerist notes. He'll also spend 60 days in jail as part of his sentence. (More restaurant workers are getting raises as the no-tipping trend widens.)

Original Story:  – People tortured in the custody of Chicago police are going to be eligible for payouts of up to $100,000 as the city tries to move on from a shameful chapter in its history. In what the Guardian calls "the first gesture of its kind in America," the city council has approved a $5.5 million reparations fund for people—most of them black men—tortured by former Cmdr. Jon Burge and his men between 1972 and 1991. Burge and a team of detectives dubbed the "Midnight Crew" used methods including electric shocks, suffocation, and Russian roulette to extract confessions from scores of suspects, NPR reports. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the historic move "another step, but an essential step, in righting a wrong—removing a stain," reports the Chicago Tribune. The city—which has already spent around $100 million settling Burge-related lawsuits—has also agreed to provide counseling, education, and job training for torture victims and their immediate relatives and will ensure that the case is taught in public schools, USA Today reports. Burge, who was fired in 1993, was not charged with any torture-related crimes before the statute of limitations expired, the Guardian notes. Last year, he finished a four-year sentence for a perjury charge stemming from a civil lawsuit and still receives a police pension.

Original Story:  – Google has quietly launched a facial recognition service for Google+, but unlike Facebook's more intrusive photo ID feature, Google is earning praise from privacy experts for keeping Find My Face an opt-in feature, reports eWeek. Like Facebook's Tag Suggestions, which launched about a year ago, Find My Face examines photos on Google+ and tries to identify the people in them. "Google is not interested in making the same mistakes Facebook made," says an analyst. Facebook received much criticism from privacy experts because its Tag Suggestions is automatically turned on, and it takes some work to opt out of the feature. Google likely has learned from its own privacy gaffes, too, such as Google Buzz, which could expose your Gmail contacts. Of course, just a few months ago Google CEO Eric Schmidt said Google would not get into facial recognition software at all, calling the technology "creepy."

Original Story:  – A 35-year-old pregnant mom a month shy of her due date survived a grueling nine-hour, two-team surgery in which she delivered her baby—and underwent open-heart surgery. Edita Tracey tells MyFoxPhilly.com she was at her hair salon last month when her back started to hurt, and when the pain shifted to her chest she called 911: "The last thing I remember is emergency people coming, and that's it." At the hospital, the doctors got to work pinpointing the issue; a CT scan revealed a rare and serious problem: Tracey's aorta, the large blood vessel that pumps blood from the heart to the rest of the body, was bulging so badly there was a one-foot tear along it. The condition, known as aortic dissection, can be lethal in seconds—but the full anesthesia she'd need to undergo to repair it could harm the baby. So two surgical groups teamed up in the hopes of saving both Tracey and her child. The first team delivered the healthy baby girl by C-section within 30 seconds of her going under, and then the cardiac team opened Tracey's chest, drained the blood collecting around her heart and got to work rebuilding her aorta in a highly complicated surgery that took nine hours. Thanks to the surgeons' fast work, the Pennsylvania mom and baby Arabella are now home and doing well. "I think that the baby saved my life," Tracey tells ABC News, which reports a "perfect storm" of conditions seems to have led to her rare condition: Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disease that weakens blood vessels' walls, and preeclampsia, a pregnancy disorder characterized by high blood pressure.

About 50 adult women were also rescued in the crackdown, who authorities say were forced into prostitution. The arrests were made in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut leading up to the game.

Original Story:  – While Chen Guangcheng lies in a Beijing hospital, authorities in his home province have gone "crazy with reprisals" for his escape from house arrest last month, he tells Reuters. He says two relatives in Shandong have been detained, including a nephew accused of brandishing a meat cleaver at guards who burst into his home; a sister-in-law was detained and released. Still others have been harassed, Chen says. The media has not been allowed to visit Chen's home village, where Christian Bale and a CNN camera crew were roughed up by guards when they tried to visit the blind dissident last year. Chen says he is having a hard time keeping in touch with family members in Shandong because most of their phones have been seized by officials, who he wants to see punished for the abuse he suffered during 19 months of illegal house arrest. Chen is being treated for injuries suffered in his escape and an intestinal problem that had gone untreated. He says threats to his family thus far won't delay plans to leave China with his wife and two children and study in the US. New York University has offered him a fellowship, while the University of Washington says it has offered him another to give him "another option, should he be interested in the West Coast," reports the Seattle Times.

Original Story:  – When Iris Grace Halmshaw's parents first supplied their daughter with painting supplies, they hoped it would be a fun way for the autistic girl to express herself. But instead of stick figures, Iris Grace immersed herself in abstract impressionist painting for hours at a time, often depicting movement in nature such as water, trees, wind, birds, and of course her cat, Thula. Now 5, Iris Grace is already selling her paintings for thousands of dollars a print, with art collectors and galleries gushing over the vibrancy and openness of her work, reports the Independent. "She is so interested in movement and how it changes things," her mother tells the paper, noting her daughter has received "a lot of references to Monet because of the Impressionistic style." It all started simply enough, with her parents opting to share their daughter's early works online. Now Iris Grace has more than 95,000 likes on Facebook, and the proceeds from her art help fund her art supplies and private therapy for her disorder, which made it difficult for her to speak until recently. Meanwhile, her mother tells ABC News they have to shield their daughter from all the attention and keep her schedule as stable and routine as possible. "Nothing has changed in Iris' world," notes her mom. (One biochemist claims to have cured her daughter of autism by removing this from her diet.)
Original Summary:  Iris Grace Halmshaw, an autistic 5-year-old girl, has become a prolific painter, creating vibrant abstract impressionist works that are selling for thousands of dollars. Her parents initially provided her with painting supplies as a way for her to express herself, but she became completely immersed in the activity, spending hours each day painting. Her mother notes that Iris Grace is particularly interested in depicting movement in nature, including water, trees, wind, and birds. The family has received attention from art collectors and galleries, and the proceeds from Iris Grace's art help fund her art supplies and private therapy. Despite the attention, her mother notes that they must keep her schedule stable and routine to help her cope with the attention.

Original Story:  – In the latest study proving everything in the world is dangerous, researchers are warning about a possible link between sunscreen and male fertility problems. The scientists investigated urine-sample data from 500 couples trying to have kids. They found that among couples taking the longest time to conceive, male partners had high levels of certain common sunscreen chemicals in their urine, CNN reports. Specifically, the guys showed high concentrations of the ultraviolet filters BP-2 or 4OH-BP, which are also found in shampoos and moisturizers. As for women, those in the study "actually had greater exposure to the UV filters overall, but their exposure wasn’t associated with any significant pregnancy delays," researcher Germaine Louis says in an NIH press release. Companies aren't legally required to list these chemicals in their products' ingredients, though lawmakers might take on the issue if further research confirms the findings, Louis says. Meanwhile, she clarifies her message: "We definitely encourage people to continue using sunscreen to avoid skin cancer. But men who are concerned about fertility may be interested in other ways to reduce their exposure to benzophenone UV filters—whether by cutting back on other products that contain the UV filters or by washing after returning indoors." (Another recent study found that macho men have so-so sperm.)

Original Story:  – Paul Allen, billionaire earthling and co-founder of Microsoft, has long been obsessed with space, and his pet project Stratolaunch Systems is beginning to bear fruit. The Washington Post reports that Stratolaunch, shaping up to be the world's largest airplane, is now 76% assembled—no small accomplishment given the sheer size of the beast, a twin-fuselage behemoth expected to weigh (payload included) 1.3 million pounds, be powered by six 747 engines, boast landing gear with 28 wheels, and house 60 miles of wiring, among other feats. But to what end? Well, to shuttle rockets up to 35,000 feet and launch them into low Earth orbit. Oh, and to do this by the end of this decade. That's right: Someday it may actually be routine to transport people and objects in the couple-hundred-miles-above-Earth section of space, and Allen is willing to bet big on it. "When such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine," he says in a statement. GeekWire says walking into the hangar at the Mojave Air and Space Port "feels as if you're stepping into the Starship Enterprise's construction zone." No wonder, given the plane's 385-foot wing, which would put the aircraft on par with the fictional spaceship. Allen isn't saying how many millions he's put into it so far, but his head of operations says this isn't just a big plane, but a big idea—and not a billionaire's "vanity project." The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, rounds up some of the other big, or just simply bizarre, aircraft built in Southern California over the years, including Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose seaplane. (See why Allen has been putting money into coral reef, too.)

The plane's 385-foot wing is comparable in size to a fictional spaceship, and Allen's head of operations calls it a "big idea" rather than a vanity project.

Original Story:  – Twitter announced Thursday that it's shutting down Vine, meaning we'll no longer be able to enjoy new 6-second bits of genius like this, or this, or maybe even this. TechCrunch reports Twitter hasn't said exactly why it's ending the video platform it launched in 2013. But, as the Verge notes, the social media company is trying desperately to figure out some way to be profitable. It also announced it's laying off 9% of its staff this week. Vine was a hit upon launch, tallying more than 200 million active users at one point. Its most popular users have more than 11 million followers each, USA Today reports. But the site fell off with increasing competition from Instagram and Snapchat. Meanwhile, Twitter appears to be shifting its focus to live video, such as its recent broadcasts of Thursday Night Football. Twitter says it's "going to do this the right way," leaving Vine up for the time being so users can download their videos. "We think it’s important to still be able to watch all the incredible Vines that have been made," the Verge quotes Twitter as saying in a statement. But the mobile app will be shut down "in the coming months." Twitter never really invested in Vine, and its three co-founders had already left, apparently unhappy with how their creation was being handled. "Don't sell your company!" one of the founders tweeted Thursday. In remembrance of the glory days of six-second videos now past, both Quartz and Deadspin are rounding up some of the best Vines for posterity.

Original Story:  – If you're undecided about whether your next glass of wine should be red or white, a new study out of Brown University may provide the tipping point: It suggests that white wine raises the risk of skin cancer. While researchers have long known that alcohol in general can raise the risk of certain cancers, this is the first time melanoma has been on the list, reports CNN. To be clear, the relative risk associated with white wine is small, but researchers still found it to be statistically significant. What's more, the increased risk seemed to affect parts of the body you wouldn't typically associate with skin cancer, such as the trunk, which is generally covered in clothes. The reasons for all this is unclear, reports CBS News. "For now, I would say that alcohol in general is related, and I would emphasize that white wine is particularly related," says study co-author Eunyoung Cho. She notes that white wine has high levels of acetaldehyde, a carcinogen that can damage DNA, and while red wine does as well, one theory is that its antioxidants might counterbalance the chemical. So should you give up your favorite white? Researchers aren't going that far. A science blogger at Forbes assesses the study, which examined data from more than 200,000 health professionals over 18 years, and concludes: "I'm still a bit skeptical, because we have no good explanation for why white wine–but not red wine, beer or other alcohol–would cause skin cancer. But still, when you reach for a glass of wine this holiday season, perhaps you should choose red instead of white."

The Desire Cruise features “clothing-optional areas (including the pool), private playrooms, adult-oriented entertainment, and provocative theme nights," according to its website. There will also be "intense icebreakers." The Original Group's CEO tells the Herald the cruise will be "the sensual way to get away." The Desire Cruise will take place aboard Royal Caribbean's 690-person Azamara Quest. And sorry looky-loos, but the New York Daily News reports it's couples-only. Other rules include: no nudity in the dining room and no sex with the crew. The cruise leaves from Italy in September 2017 with stops in Croatia and Slovenia, and, presumably, Bonetown. Esquire helpfully lists the sights high-seas sex-havers can expect to see, including "butts," "more butts," and "the striking waterfront installations of Croatian architect Nikola Bašic.” Tickets for this boat-based bacchanalia run between $2,800 and $11,000.

Since early May, several state regulators have reported too much lead and MSG in the noodles, and the country's main food safety regulator called all varieties of Maggi noodles "unsafe and hazardous" for consumption, per the Times of India. Nestle pulled them off the shelves Friday but says the noodles are still safe. State regulators, who have semi-judicial powers, are expected to deliver a verdict by next week. It began last year when an officer with the Food Safety and Drug Administration in Uttar Pradesh, India's biggest state, had his team test Maggi noodles, Bloomberg reports. Their finding of MSG and lead (which Nestle disputed) has now created a crisis for the nation's food-regulation office, which is only seven years old. The scare has also spread to Nepal and Singapore, where authorities are testing pasta and noodles made by seven companies, including Nestle. Maggi has suffered "a serious hit," a brand expert says, adding that Nestle "was slow to react and uncommunicative in initial days." However, Maggi has a large consumer base and "people want this brand in their lives." Nestle's Global CEO Paul Bulcke says that "we will do everything it takes, and are fully engaged with the authorities to clarify the situation."

Original Story:  – Facebook is flush with IPO cash, and it's going shopping. Rumors started flying yesterday that the social network was near a deal to buy Face.com, the facial recognition software company behind the Klik mobile app. Sources tell TechCrunch that the deal is "definitely" happening, with a final price of $100 million. There's also buzz that it's after a bigger fish: Opera. Shares of the Norwegian company, which makes a popular mobile web browser, surged today on that speculation, RTTNews reports. The Face.com move is being widely applauded by pundits. TechCrunch calls it a "natural acquisition target" because "photos are core to Facebook's lock-in strategy." Tom Cheredar of Venture Beat agrees, noting that the "vast majority" of Facebook's photos have "lots of faces" and that it would get "a pretty wonderful domain name" to boot. The Opera rumor hasn't gone over as well. "Buying Opera will likely be another stupid acquisition" like Instagram, a Global Equities Research note told investors today, according to PC Mag. "Opera will narrow Facebook's ecosystem and not broaden it, which Facebook desperately needs right now."
Original Summary:  Facebook is reportedly close to acquiring Face.com, a facial recognition software company, for $100 million. The move is seen as a natural acquisition target for Facebook, as photos are core to the platform's lock-in strategy. TechCrunch and other pundits are applauding the move, noting that Facebook will gain access to a valuable domain name and a wealth of facial recognition technology. However, some are skeptical of Facebook's potential acquisition of Opera, a mobile web browser company, as it may narrow Facebook's ecosystem rather than broaden it. Global Equities Research has called the rumored acquisition "stupid" and warned that it could limit Facebook's growth.

Original Story:  – Ending an argument we're sure has happened at least once on a slow afternoon in a bar somewhere, a court will finally decide whether stand-up paddleboarding is closer to surfing or canoeing. The New York Times reports the Court of Arbitration for Sport has been asked to settle a dispute between the International Surfing Association and International Canoe Federation, both of which are fighting for control of the increasingly popular sport of stand-up paddleboarding, or SUP. The battle for control of SUP has become more urgent as the Olympics is considering adding it to future games. The ISA argues SUP is performed on a board, like surfing; it also claims it's been holding SUP competitions for years, Deadspin reports. The ICF counters that SUP uses a paddle. "Propulsion using a paddle is basically canoeing," the ICF secretary general says. "Standing up or sitting down is irrelevant." But the ISA claims the ICF is trying to jump on the bandwagon. "We have a track record of doing this," Reuters quotes the ISA president as saying. "At the ICF now there is an interest of how they can be part of the popularity of the sport." The ISA calls itself "the historical rightful custodian" of SUP, and the ICF claims its opponent has rejected all offers of compromise. No date has been set for the court's decision.
Original Summary:  A court case has been brought by the International Surfing Association (ISA) against the International Canoe Federation (ICF) to determine whether stand-up paddleboarding (SUP) is closer to surfing or canoeing. The ISA argues that SUP is performed on a board like surfing and has been holding competitions for years, while the ICF counters that SUP uses a paddle, making it more like canoeing. The ISA claims the ICF is trying to jump on the popularity of the sport, while the ICF argues that it has a track record of being involved in water sports. The court has not yet set a date for its decision. The outcome of the case could determine whether SUP is included in future Olympics.

Original Story:  – Twenty years ago, residents of British Columbia in northwestern Canada didn't have to worry about the deadliest mushroom in the world. But Amanita phalloides, the "death cap" mushroom, likely hitched a ride on trees being imported into the area to beautify city streets and is now flourishing, resulting in multiple poisonings. Just this week, it may have been responsible for the death of a 3-year-old boy in Victoria, reports the Globe and Mail. He died after going wild mushroom picking with his family and eating one. The death cap is said to look very similar to the popular paddy straw mushroom, with a white cap and yellowish stem that can be bulbous at its base. While toxicology results have yet to confirm what the boy ate, his family is urging the public to be aware of the risks; ingesting just one cap can be fatal, and the CBC reports that death caps are responsible for nine out of every 10 mushroom poisoning deaths in the world. "It's worthwhile learning how to recognize this particular species because of the consequences if you accidentally eat it," says one forest ecologist. Toxins attack multiple organs, including the kidneys and liver. (A pack of oddly behaving coyotes may have been tripping on mushrooms.)
Original Summary:  The death cap mushroom, Amanita phalloides, has been found in British Columbia, Canada, and is believed to have caused the death of a 3-year-old boy. The mushroom was likely introduced to the area through imported trees. The death cap is similar in appearance to the popular paddy straw mushroom, but is highly toxic and can cause fatal poisoning if ingested. Toxins from the mushroom attack multiple organs, including the kidneys and liver. The family of the boy who died is urging the public to be aware of the risks of the death cap mushroom.

Original Story:  – A project to scan Egypt's pyramids for 4,500-year-old secrets is turning up "anomalies" that may lead to hidden passages and more, Discovery reports. Two weeks of thermal scanning have revealed signs of internal cavities and structures in several pyramids and a standout anomaly at the so-called Great Pyramid, also known as Cheops. "This anomaly is really quite impressive and it's just in front of us, at the ground level," says researcher Mehdi Tayoubi. He called the anomaly "impressive and obvious" but inconclusive. Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty was more specific: "There is something like a small passage in the ground that you can see, leading up to the pyramids ground, reaching an area with a different temperature," he said, per the AP. "What will be behind it?" In this first phase of the Scan Pyramids project, a team from Cairo University and the Heritage, Innovation and Preservation organization explored the pyramids with technologies including a thermal camera. The idea was to see how pyramid stones heated up in the morning and cooled down in the evening, and big temperature differences between adjacent stones could indicate structural differences inside the pyramid. Led by Tayoubi, researchers spotted a 6-degree difference in a block of stones on the ground level at Cheops. "We need now to build models and thermal simulations to test different hypotheses in order to understand what we have found," says Tayoubi. The project is slated to continue next year with an infrared scan of the pyramids. (Also giving up potential secrets? King Tut's tomb.)

Original Story:  – A federal prosecutor in Texas has posted his views about Trayvon Martin and President Obama on Facebook, and they're not pretty.

I am fresh out of 'purple drank.' So, I may come by for a visit. In a rainstorm. In the middle of the night. In a hoodie. Don't get upset or anything if you see me looking in your window...kay?" Craft also derided Obama supporters, saying "low information voters carried the day for the Dalibama in the last election." Asked about his Facebook activity, Craft said only that it was "not related to the US Attorney's office." Craft's boss, US Attorney Malcolm Bales, didn't sound too pleased about the whole thing: "It speaks ill of our office in connection," he said. "We don't think like that. We don't act like that."

Original Story:  – Ever since 18 men and boys were busted in the gang rape of an 11-year-old girl, there have been hints of a “blame the victim” mentality emerging—and last night, some residents crossed from hints to explicitly blaming the 11-year-old girl. “She lied about her age. Them boys didn't rape her. She wanted this to happen. I'm not taking nobody's side, but if she hadn't put herself in that predicament, this would have never happened,” said one resident. Many others who attended a town meeting also told reporters the 11-year-old had consented to sex with those accused, the AP reports via the Houston Chronicle. The meeting was supposedly held to discuss concerns about the investigation, but many in attendance used it to voice claims that the 11-year-old was to blame because of the way she dressed, or to hypothesize that she lied about her age. Others opposed those views, noting that Texas’s age of consent is 17, and that even if the girl did claim to be older, an 11-year-old simply cannot legally give consent. Quanell X, the Houston activist who led the meeting, said he “did not come here this evening to jump on an 11-year-old girl,” but also questioned why the girl didn’t report the attack herself.

Original Story:  – A girl in Britain is set to become the nation's youngest mother when she gives birth in the coming weeks—at the age of 11. The Guardian reports that few details about the girl are available for legal reasons. The father is believed to be a minor as well, a few years older than the girl. Police are investigating the situation. The age of consent in Britain is 16, the Huffington Post reports. Britain's current youngest mother was 12 when she gave birth in 2014; her baby is being raised by its 28-year-old grandmother. Britain's youngest father was 12 years old when his son was born in 1998. Meanwhile, one of Britain's former youngest mothers, Tressa Middleton, who gave birth at the age of 12 in 2006, is expecting another child, Metro.co.uk reports. Middleton was forced to give up her first child after it was revealed she was impregnated when her brother raped her. "I am finally going to be the mother I have longed to be all these years," says Middleton, now 23. Despite these record-holders making headlines, Britain's teen birth rate is the lowest it's been since records began about 50 years ago, reports the Telegraph. It notes that while better education and access to contraception is credited, another theory points out that the decline coincides with the rise of social media, suggesting that teens are spending more time with their phones than significant others. The average age of British mothers is now the highest on record at 30.2 years old. (Half of this country's married couples aren't having sex.)

Original Story:  – Brazil's efforts ahead of the 2016 Olympics are "the worst" International Olympic Committee VP John Coates has "ever experienced," he says. Construction of some venues hasn't even started, Coates notes, and IOC officials have been forced to join local organizers to plan the Games. The "hands-on role" is "unprecedented for the IOC, but there is no Plan B. We are going to Rio," he says, per the BBC. Coates says that in terms of planning, these Olympics are "worse than Athens" in 2004, which also experienced delays. Among the issues are infrastructure delays, water quality concerns, and "social issues that need to be addressed" in Rio de Janeiro, he notes, via the Australian Olympic Committee. Staffers are inexperienced, and "no one is able to give answers at the moment." But "if it comes off—the first (Olympic) Games on the South American continent, in a magical city in so many ways—it'll be a wonderful experience for the athletes," he adds, per the AP.

He noted that infrastructure delays, water quality concerns, and social issues in Rio de Janeiro are among the issues affecting the Games. IOC staffers are inexperienced and unable to provide answers, according to Coates. Despite the challenges, Coates expressed hope that the Games will be a positive experience for athletes if they are executed successfully.

Among the issues are infrastructure delays, water quality concerns, and "social issues that need to be addressed" in Rio de Janeiro, he notes, via the Australian Olympic Committee. Staffers are inexperienced, and "no one is able to give answers at the moment." But "if it comes off—the first (Olympic) Games on the South American continent, in a magical city in so many ways—it'll be a wonderful experience for the athletes," he adds, per the AP.
Injected Summary:  Brazil is facing significant challenges in preparing for the 2016 Olympics, with construction of some venues yet to begin and infrastructure delays causing concern. International Olympic Committee (IOC) Vice President John Coates has described the situation as the worst he has ever experienced, with IOC officials taking an unprecedented hands-on role in planning the Games. Coates notes that there are issues with water quality, social problems, and inexperienced staff, but if the Games come off as planned, it will be a wonderful experience for the athletes.

Original Story:  – Introducing Metaspriggina, a minnow-sized fish that lived about 500 million years ago and appears to occupy a crucial branch of your family tree. Scientists say the creature might just be the ancestor of nearly all vertebrates, reports LiveScience. The revelation comes after study of dozens of remarkably well-preserved Metaspriggina fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. Researchers discovered that the fish had a pair of gill arches near the front of its body that are the "primitive precursors of the jaw," reports the Toronto Star. It's the first time such a feature has been seen in the fossil record, reports PhysOrg. “It was a major event in the evolution of vertebrates," says the co-author of a new report in Nature. "After the creation of jaws, vertebrates were able to capture prey and (chew) food." Metaspriggina also had something called a notochord, essentially cartilage that ran the length of its body. The New York Times notes that "human embryos develop a notochord, too, but it later turns into the disks of cartilage between the vertebrae in our spine." A British Columbia expert not involved with the work says the fish is "clearly a benchmark early vertebrate, which we haven't seen before."
Original Summary:  Metaspriggina, a small fish that lived 500 million years ago, may be the ancestor of all vertebrates, according to a new study. Scientists have discovered dozens of well-preserved fossils of the fish in the Canadian Rockies, which reveal a pair of gill arches near its front body that are the "primitive precursors of the jaw." This is the first time such a feature has been seen in the fossil record. The discovery is significant because it shows that after the evolution of jaws, vertebrates were able to capture prey and chew food. Metaspriggina also had a notochord, a cartilage that runs the length of the body, which is similar to the structure found in human embryos.

Original Story:  – At just 21 years old, Dakota Meyer charged into a firefight in Afghanistan—five times—to save 36 lives from an ambush, and today he will become the first living Marine to receive the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War. But before the ceremony honoring his actions on September 8, 2009, Meyer wanted something else: the chance to have a beer with the president. They did just that on a patio outside the Oval Office yesterday, reports CBS News. During the meeting, Meyer asked the president for advice on how to achieve success. "He said, 'You know, first thing, get an education and he said just take it slow and don't try to make any rash decisions,'" Meyer tells CBS. Meyer, who was injured in the 2009 ambush, also pulled the bodies of dead comrades from the combat zone, NPR notes. He says that it's "really tough" to be recognized for what he calls the worst day of his life. During his ceremony, at his request, Meyer's fallen friends will also be remembered in hometown ceremonies.

Original Story:  – Two former Virginia Tech students were indicted by a grand jury Tuesday in one of the year's most shocking murder cases. David Eisenhauer and Natalie Keepers, both 19, are accused of plotting to kill 13-year-old Nicole Lovell and could be sentenced to life in prison without parole when their cases go to trial next March, the Washington Post reports. Prosecutors haven't said why the freshmen engineering majors would have wanted to kill the teen, though law enforcement sources have told the Post that Eisenhauer had an inappropriate relationship with Nicole, a liver transplant recipient whose disappearance on Jan. 27 this year led to a frantic search because she didn't have her medication, NBC News notes. Eisenhauer, who allegedly slit the girl's throat after she sneaked out of her house to meet him, was indicted on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder, as well as a fresh charge of concealing a body, WDBJ reports. Keepers, who has told investigators she was not present when Nicole was murdered, was indicted on charges of concealment and being an accessory before the fact. Prosecutors say they're unable to pursue the death penalty against Eisenhauer because there's no evidence that he had sexual contact with the girl on the day of the kidnapping, the AP reports. (Police have described Eisenhauer as a "sociopath" and Keepers as a "sociopath in training.")

Original Story:  – A North Korean ship slipping across the South's borders was apparently just the opening act. Days after South Korea began its war games with the US, North Korea has fired four, suspected short-range missiles from its southeastern coast toward the sea, a South Korean defense official said, per Yonhap News. "We first believed they were an improved version of the KN-02 ground-to-ship missile, but we now believe they are Scud series missiles, as they have a range of more than (125 miles)," says a government source. While the AP notes that missile launches are routine in the North, a Scud launch would be North Korea's first since 2009. South Korea notes it "will maintain tight vigilance in preparation for additional launches or any military provocation from the North," while an expert tells the AFP that the launch is "mainly about sending a message—about the drills and also its anger over the recent UN rights report ... I don't think it will take any further steps and risk escalating tensions. Pyongyang is more interested in seeing some benefit from its compromise on the reunions."
Original Summary:  A North Korean ship was spotted crossing into South Korea, leading to speculation of an impending missile launch. Four suspected short-range missiles were fired from North Korea's southeastern coast towards the sea, according to a South Korean defense official. The missiles are believed to be Scud series missiles, with a range of over 125 miles, and are North Korea's first launch since 2009. South Korea has vowed to maintain vigilance and prepare for additional launches or military provocation from the North. An expert believes the launch is primarily a message to the US and South Korea regarding their ongoing military drills and North Korea's anger over a recent UN human rights report, and that Pyongyang is unlikely to take further aggressive actions.

"I am probably not who you expected to hear from today." But he then went on to apologize for not treating gay people kindly while growing up in a rural small town. A key passage: "There were some kids in my class that were different. Sometimes I wasn't kind to them. I didn't know it at the time, but I know now that they were gay. I will forever regret not treating them with the kindness, dignity, and respect—the love—that they deserved. For that, I sincerely and humbly apologize. Over the intervening years, my heart has changed. It has changed because of you."

Original Story:  – A visiting UN mission said today that Syria's assault on the village of Tremseh targeted mostly activists and rebels, not civilians, as some reports had claimed. But the attack did violate Syria's peace commitment to the UN and the Arab League by using heavy weapons such as artillery and mortars, the mission said. Special envoy Kofi Annan said he was "shocked and appalled" by the massacre, which killed at least 200 people, the BBC reports. In other Syria news today: Tremseh villagers endured seven hours of shelling before being hunted down house by house, they tell the Guardian. "We don't understand why they attacked us," a woman said. "All we've done here is hold demonstrations." Turkish leaders slammed their Syrian counterparts, saying Syria's people will "make them pay" for such massacres, MSNBC reports. The Red Cross labeled the uprising an "internal armed conflict"—or civil war—which lays the groundwork for possible war crimes prosecutions. Violence continued in the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh, where government helicopter gunships and hundreds of soldiers reportedly attacked. "The shelling has wounded dozens of people but we don't have medical resources to treat them," said one activist. Fighting across the country claimed 28 lives today and 118 yesterday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Original Story:  – When a highly automated train crashed into a Quebec town last weekend, its conductor was not on board. Which raises a few questions, writes Holman Jenkins at the Wall Street Journal. Why couldn't the train tell headquarters it had taken off? Why couldn't headquarters stop it from afar? And most fundamentally, "Why does a train need an operator?" The same question came to mind in the Asiana crash, in which human pilots appear to have been relying on a system that was down at the time. Humans pilots are losing a dangerous amount of skill as they rely on the computers, and "operating a train, a plane or a car is arguably becoming a poor use of human capital anyway." Yes, unemployment is high now, but as our population ages, we'll soon have a workforce crunch. Fully automated transportation is necessary, and seemingly inevitable with Google already advancing self-driving cars. "If computers ever get the vote, they will quickly vote the rest of us off the road as the major hazard to their safely zooming around." Click for the full column.
Original Summary:  A recent train crash in Quebec highlights concerns about the role of human operators in transportation. The train's conductor was not on board when it crashed, raising questions about why a train needs an operator in the first place. The use of automation in transportation is becoming more prevalent, with systems like autopilot and self-driving cars being developed. However, relying too heavily on technology can lead to a loss of human skill and a potential workforce crunch in the future. Fully automated transportation may be necessary and inevitable, but it raises questions about the safety of having computers in control of vehicles.

Original Story:  – As many as 12 World War II bunkers have been identified beneath the city of Rome, thought to have been built for Benito Mussolini or other party leaders, reports Business Insider. Three are now set to open to the public on Halloween; two were opened for a short time in 2006, but one will be made public for the first time. The new site is a shelter made from a converted wine cellar that lies under Mussolini's elaborate gardens, roughly 400 feet from his villa's living quarters (the family would have had to run above ground to reach it). AP describes it as being hastily constructed in 1940, and notes its iron-rung ladder (for "emergency exits") and a rusting machine meant to purify the air in the event of a gas attack. The bunker and its anti-gas doors will serve as a stark reminder of "one of the darkest pages of our history," according to Rome's department for culture, per Reuters. After refashioning the wine cellar, Mussolini went on to build at least two more bunkers, one of which was reinforced with up to 13 feet of concrete. Mussolini was arrested before it had been completed, but had it been finished, it would have been Italy's most resistant air raid shelter devoted to just one family. (A bunker that may have been designed for Mussolini and his mistress was discovered in 2011.)

The bunker and its anti-gas doors will serve as a stark reminder of "one of the darkest pages of our history," according to Rome's department for culture, per Reuters. After refashioning the wine cellar, Mussolini went on to build at least two more bunkers, one of which was reinforced with up to 13 feet of concrete. Mussolini was arrested before it had been completed, but had it been finished, it would have been Italy's most resistant air raid shelter devoted to just one family. (A bunker that may have been designed for Mussolini and his mistress was discovered in 2011. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars.)
Injected Summary:  At least 12 World War II bunkers have been discovered beneath Rome, believed to be built for Benito Mussolini or other party leaders. Three of these bunkers will be opened to the public on Halloween, including a shelter made from a converted wine cellar. The bunker is located roughly 400 feet from Mussolinis living quarters and was hastily constructed in 1940. The bunker features an iron-rung ladder and a rusting machine for purifying the air in the event of a gas attack. The discovery of these bunkers serves as a reminder of "one of the darkest pages of our history."

Original Story:  – The University of Massachusetts at Amherst is backtracking less than two weeks after announcing a controversial policy barring Iranian nationals from some science and engineering programs, including physics, chemistry, and chemical engineering. After consulting with the State Department, the school says it will now create "individualized study plans to meet the requirements of federal sanctions law and address the impact on students," USA Today reports. The initial policy, revealed Feb. 6, was in response to a 2012 law and "conflicts with our institutional values and principles," UMass says in a statement, per NBC News. "It is now clear, after further consultation and deliberation, that we can adopt a less restrictive policy."

Original Story:  – It's been a year since the Catholic Church chose Jorge Bergoglio as its new pope, and while Pope Francis marks the anniversary with a low-key, week-long spiritual retreat with cardinals and bishops—he characteristically traveled there by bus—here's a look at how he's been doing over the last 12 months: People love Francis: The first non-European pope in 1,000 years hasn't had trouble fitting in. Italian opinion polls give him the highest popularity of any recent pope, while the US approval rate sits at 55%, even as the UN has ripped the Vatican a new one, the Wall Street Journal and the BBC note. That's not to mention his 11 million followers across his various Twitter accounts, the huge crowds, and pilgrims flocking to Rome in record numbers. Compassion: His high standing could have a lot to do with the compassion he's shown divorcees, those who've abandoned Mass, gay people, and Jews and Muslims, even though his views don't always get a lot of support from traditionalist cardinals. No deep change: But has anything really changed? A BBC correspondent notes Francis has given us that perception—whereas predecessor Pope Benedict called homosexuality "intrinsically evil," Francis has said he's not one to judge—but it has been "a change of style rather than of substance." As for the Catholic Church's stance on birth control or the celibacy rule for priests, there doesn't seem to be any budging. Still, E.J. Dionne notes in the Washington Post that Francis' first year has been "an anti-imperial papacy" from the start. "He has not altered church doctrine, but his shift in emphasis has been breathtaking," and his ability to move beyond gay marriage, birth control, and abortion, shows his stance is "primarily with and for the neediest." His overhaul of the Congregation for Bishops and appointment of "outsider" cardinals to advise him on church reform stands out, too, and shows a move toward a horizontal church, inspired by Jesuits. "Liberals who would like to see significant doctrinal shifts from Francis should alter their expectations," write Lizzy Davies and Sam Jones for the Guardian. "But that doesn't mean there will be no change at all." Next up: The Vatican Bank will be at the heart of Pope Francis' reforms and he hasn't ruled out closing it for good. Meanwhile, all eyes will be on how he responds to sex abuse allegations within the church—his emerging blind spot, the Guardian notes.
Original Summary:  Pope Francis has been in office for a year and has been popular among Catholics, with high approval ratings in Italy and the US. He has shown compassion towards marginalized groups, such as divorcees, LGBTQ individuals, and Jews and Muslims. However, there has been little change in the Catholic Church's stance on controversial issues like birth control and priestly celibacy. Francis has made some changes to the Church's leadership, including appointing "outsider" cardinals to advise him on reform. The Vatican Bank is expected to be a focus of Francis' reforms, and he has not ruled out closing it permanently.

Original Story:  – Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who helped lead the probe into Russian election interference until a maelstrom developed around his anti-Trump text messages, has been fired, his attorney confirmed Monday. President Trump, who viewed Strzok's animosity toward him as typical of the DC establishment behind what he calls the Robert Mueller "witch hunt," was among those celebrating the news. Coverage: Overruled: Strzok's attorney, Aitan Goelman, thinks his 48-year-old client was unfairly punished given that the FBI's own Office of Professional Responsibility recommended only a 60-day suspension and a demotion. However, the FBI's No. 2, David Bowdich, overruled that recommendation, reports the New York Times. Strzok spent more than 20 years at the FBI and had become a top counterintelligence agent. Trump: “Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally," the president wrote. "The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back!”

Original Story:  – One of the original Beastie Boys—and the one said to have coined the hip-hop band's name—has died at the age of 52, Rolling Stone reports. Guitarist John Berry died at a Danvers, Mass., hospice Thursday, his stepmother, Louise Berry, tells the AP, noting that he had suffered from frontal lobe dementia that had been intensifying in the months before his death. Per his dad, John Berry III, Berry helped found the group in the early '80s with Mike Diamond when they were both students at NYC's Walden School, joined afterward by Adam "MCA" Yauch and Kate Schellenbach. The group's first 7-inch EP was Polly Wog Stew, and Berry left the band shortly after its release; his departure was followed by Schellenbach's, and Adam "Ad-Rock" Horowitz came in to replace the two of them, per Billboard. Berry's dad tells the AP that as the band started hitting the big time, his son simply "wasn't up for that rigor," which prompted his decision to leave. Billboard relays part of the Beasties' 2012 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction speech, written by Yauch, in which it was revealed how Berry's dad would often burst into their early jam sessions, held in his loft, exclaiming, "Will you turn that f---ing s--- off already?!" In that same speech, Yauch acknowledged Berry's contributions to the band. Other bands Berry played in after his Beastie days included Even Worse and Big Fat Love. Berry's family says it's planning an autumn celebration of his life for the public. He's the second Beastie to pass: Yauch died of cancer in 2012 at the age of 47. The Inquistr explains how Berry came up with the band's name.

He left the band shortly after the release of their first EP, "Polly Wog Stew," and was replaced by Adam Horowitz. Berry's departure from the band was reportedly due to the "rigor" of the band's success. Berry went on to play in other bands after his time in the Beastie Boys, and his family is planning a public celebration of his life for the fall.

Original Story:  – Just a few days after being bitten by a cobra, Malaysia's famous "Snake Whisperer" has died. The Star and Free Malaysia Today report that 33-year-old firefighter Abu Zarin Hussin was attacked by the snake earlier this week in Betong while trying to catch it, and he was rushed to two different hospitals over the past several days, finally succumbing to his injuries in the ICU of the Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Hospital on Friday. Hussin, who the BBC says kept four snakes at home, had become both a local and international celebrity for his snake-handling acumen, which he used to train fellow firefighters so that they could respond to calls about snake sightings. Under Hussin's tutelage, firefighters learned how to ID different types of snakes, with a particular eye for the poisonous ones, as well as the most humane ways to capture them. Newsweek explains how Hussin shot to international fame in 2016 when overseas tabloids mistakenly used his picture for a story on a man who reportedly married his pet snake. An interview in the Star noted Hussin, who began his hobby in 2007, got his inspiration from his snake-charmer dad. "Before I joined the [fire department], I was afraid of snakes and would avoid them," he said. "But ... now [I] practice with [my father]." Hussin had been bitten a few times before, with one incident in 2015 even sending him into a two-day coma. But he couldn't stay away from the slithery reptiles, and he even took his act to Asia's Got Talent. A zookeeper tells the New Straits Times how, after he was bit by a snake in 2012, he met Hussin and struck up an instant friendship. "I have lost a daring and genuine friend," he says. (This man posed with a rattler, then got bit.)

Original Story:  – Abraham Lincoln helped free a black male slave long before the Civil War, and researchers say they've found the man's grave—in a former psychiatric hospital's cemetery, the AP reports. A budding lawyer, Lincoln won a case before the Illinois Supreme Court in 1841 that released Nance Legins-Costley from indentured servitude, which historians say amounted to slavery for a black woman. Legins-Costley walked away with her 10-month-old son, William Henry Costley, and lived to a ripe old age in her central Illinois hometown of Pekin. But what became of the first black male slave freed by Lincoln? An amateur historian named Carl Adams spent years investigating the story and published a book about Legins-Costley last year, Nance: Trials of the First Slave Freed by Abraham Lincoln—A True Story of Nance Legins-Costley. The editor of a history journal says Nance tells "the only story of Lincoln that is really new," according to a site dedicated to the book. Costley apparently enlisted in a colored-troops regiment from Illinois in 1864, was wounded in the war, and found himself dispatched in Galveston, Texas. A few years later, an all-white jury found him not guilty in the shooting death of a man considered disreputable; Costley said he was protecting a woman when he pulled the trigger. Eventually, Costley moved to Minnesota, became an invalid, and lived in a psychiatric hospital in Rochester. There, Adams says, lies a grave that matches a number from hospital records as Costley's. It also recently received a "Costley" headstone. "I think it is so likely that it's nearly a sure thing," says a Lincoln expert. (Read about a black slave whose story was rewritten, 150 years later.)
Original Summary:  Abraham Lincoln freed a black male slave named Nance Legins-Costley in 1841, and a recent discovery of a grave in a former psychiatric hospital cemetery may be the final resting place of Costley. Costley was a slave who won a court case against Lincoln, and he later enlisted in a colored-troops regiment during the Civil War. After the war, Costley was found not guilty in the shooting death of a man and moved to Minnesota, where he lived in a psychiatric hospital until his death. An amateur historian has identified a grave in Rochester, Minnesota, that may be Costley's, and a Lincoln expert believes it is likely to be his final resting place.

Original Story:  – New parents in New Jersey will soon be going home with a "baby box" that's filled with essentials and doubles as a newborn's bed. The first-in-the-nation program is intended to educate parents and reduce deaths by Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the Philly Voice reports. Funded by a grant from the CDC, the state intends to distribute 105,000 cardboard boxes to parents who sign up online and take a course. The kits come packed with diapers, wipes, breast pads, a onesie, and other supplies. Take those goodies out and a mattress and fitted sheet double as baby's first bed, per Babble. Temple University tested the program last year in a trial in collaboration with the LA-based maker Baby Box Company, which runs similar initiatives in 12 countries. Putting newborns to bed in a box is nothing new in Finland, which has been doing it since 1938, per the BBC. The practice is credited with reducing infant mortality there to the world's lowest rate, 1.3 deaths per 1,000. The US ranks 23rd, with 6.5 deaths per 1,000. The idea seems to be catching on. Scotland began handing out boxes to new parents on Jan. 1, and Alberta, Canada, is testing the idea, per the Independent. Dr. Kathie McCans, who pushed for the New Jersey initiative, calls the boxes "adorable," but says education is the focus. The compact space is safer for little ones, though many people might not know that. "We need to change care takers’ knowledge about what constitutes safe sleep," she tells CBS Philly.

Original Summary:  New parents in New Jersey will soon receive a "baby box" filled with essential items for their newborn, as part of a state-funded program aimed at reducing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) deaths. The program, the first of its kind in the US, will distribute 105,000 cardboard boxes to parents who sign up online and complete a course. The boxes come with diapers, wipes, breast pads, a onesie, and other supplies, and can be used as a baby's first bed. The program is modeled after similar initiatives in Finland, where the practice of putting newborns to bed in a box has been credited with reducing infant mortality to the world's lowest rate. The program is being implemented in other countries, including Scotland and Canada.

Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. The first-in-the-nation program is intended to educate parents and reduce deaths by Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the Philly Voice reports. Funded by a grant from the CDC, the state intends to distribute 105,000 cardboard boxes to parents who sign up online and take a course. The kits come packed with diapers, wipes, breast pads, a onesie, and other supplies. Take those goodies out and a mattress and fitted sheet double as baby's first bed, per Babble. Temple University tested the program last year in a trial in collaboration with the LA-based maker Baby Box Company, which runs similar initiatives in 12 countries. Putting newborns to bed in a box is nothing new in Finland, which has been doing it since 1938, per the BBC. The practice is credited with reducing infant mortality there to the world's lowest rate, 1.3 deaths per 1,000. The US ranks 23rd, with 6.5 deaths per 1,000. The idea seems to be catching on.

Original Story:  – Chicago has earned the unwanted distinction of having the nation's worst heroin problem. And by at least one measure, no other city is close. The Chicago area registered about 24,000 ER visits related to heroin between 2008 and 2010, says a new report by the Illinois Consortium on Drug Policy. In a distance second place was New York City, with about 12,000 such visits, reports the Huffington Post. The problem is worse in the suburbs than in the city itself, notes the Chicago Tribune, with the consortium's report citing a spike in fatal overdoses there. The newspaper sees signs of hope, however, including a new Good Samaritan law that gives partial immunity to drug users who phone 911 to report another's overdose.

New York City is in second place with around 12,000 such visits. The problem is particularly severe in the suburbs, with a spike in fatal overdoses. However, there are signs of hope, including a new Good Samaritan law that provides partial immunity to drug users who call 911 to report an overdose. The law aims to encourage more people to seek help in emergency situations.

Original Story:  – At 1,066 feet, a tower rising in Brazil will be taller than New York City's Chrysler Building—or any skyscraper in South America—but it won't have any neighbors in sight. The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory, around 100 miles from the city of Manuas, is designed to gather information on things like cloud formation and greenhouse gases from a rainforest site far from human habitation, reports the BBC. The steel being used to build the huge tower has been brought thousands of miles from southern Brazil by truck and by raft, AFP reports. The tower—which will join a network of smaller observatory towers in the region—is expected to deliver vital information on how climate change is affecting the sensitive Amazon ecosystem, which in turn affects the release of carbon. "The tower will help us answer innumerable questions related to global climate change," explains a project director from the University of Sao Paulo. "We will gain a better understanding of the role of the Amazon and other humid tropical areas in climate models." (In another major Amazon project, Brazil is taking a census of the rainforest's trillions of trees.)

Original Story:  – A pregnant teen is in critical condition after an unprovoked road-rage shooting in Reedley, Calif., police say. The 18-year-old victim, who hasn't been named, was riding in an SUV driven by her husband, 26, on Sunday night when he passed a slow-moving vehicle, reports NBC News. Described as a light brown Chevy Tahoe, Suburban, or GMC Yukon, the vehicle drove up beside the couple soon after and one of at least two occupants opened fire through the driver's side window, per the Washington Post. A bullet hit the female passenger, who is three months pregnant, in her left eye. Police say her husband turned the vehicle around, pulled over, and asked a bystander to call police. He then rushed to a nearby hospital escorted by a police officer. Once there, the victim was airlifted to another hospital for emergency surgery, but the details of her condition and that of her unborn child aren't known. The Fresno County Sheriff's Office says the confrontation "appears to have been unprovoked…so it's unclear why someone in the suspect's vehicle resorted to an act of violence." Authorities are still searching for a suspect. (A video of this road rage incident went viral.)

Original Story:  – Art experts may never agree on whether it is an authentic Caravaggio, but a painting one family found when checking a leak in the rafters of an old house in southern France may turn out to be worth upward of $136 million. The large canvas, which measures 56 inches by 69 inches, has already been dated to between 1600 and 1610, reports the Guardian. A leading expert tells AFP that the painting depicting Biblical heroine Judith beheading an Assyrian general is a "true original" that is "almost certainly identifiable, even if we do not have any tangible or irrefutable proof." The so-called "Lost Caravaggio" likely went missing a century after it was painted, while another version of it rediscovered in 1950 hangs at the National Gallery of Ancient Art in Rome, reports the BBC. Caravaggio, born in 1571, is known for having led a violent and chaotic life (he was jailed often and is said to have killed a man) and died mysteriously at just 38 years of age. But he also pioneered the Baroque painting technique known as chiaroscuro, which features light and shadow in sharp contrast. The expert the family turned the dusty painting over to upon finding it in April 2014 has consulted with many others, including at the Louvre in Paris and in Caravaggio's native Italy, and concludes that a "copier or a less talented artist" wouldn't have been able to paint so masterfully, reports the Los Angeles Times. Meanwhile, France has banned the export of the painting for 30 months to allow for a full investigation. (Another hundred early Caravaggio works were found just a few years ago.)

Original Story:  – The man on trial for ordering Hélène Pastor's 2014 murder had for four weeks insisted he had nothing to do with her death. The BBC reports that changed in a startling way on Tuesday with the shock 11th-hour confession of Wojciech Janowski, 69. The former Polish diplomat to Monaco was on Wednesday found guilty of ordering the hit that killed his partner's billionaire mother at age 77, as well as her driver. The two were exiting a hospital in Nice where Pastor had been visiting her son when a gunman fired on them. The chauffeur died four days later; Pastor, who was heir to a real-estate empire within Monaco, died roughly two weeks after the attack. The Local reports her family owned some 4,000 apartments, and prosecutors argued the crime was a financial one. They said Janowski's businesses were failing, and that the €500,000 he and his common-law partner of 28 years, Sylvia Ratkowski, received from her mother each month was at risk, as the payments would cease upon Ratkowski's own death; she had been diagnosed with cancer in 2012. Janowski's personal trainer was handed a 30-year sentence for helping arrange the hit. He quoted Janowski as saying to him, "This cannot go on, Sylvia's illness has deteriorated, we have to get rid of the old woman. Can you help me?" Janowski has been sentenced to life in prison, as were the gunman and the man who acted as lookout. The confession was actually read aloud by Janowski's lawyer as Janowski cried next to him. The Times reports the lawyer had asked that his client be acquitted of the driver's murder; he was not. (This billionaire was kidnapped in Tanzania last week.)

However, in a shocking turn of events, Janowski confessed to the murder on Tuesday, revealing that he had ordered the hit due to financial motives.

Original Story:  – Remember that massive Equifax data breach that exposed the names, security numbers, and more of 143 million US consumers? It now appears Equifax had "clear and simple instructions" on how to avoid it and more than two months to follow them. The credit reporting company announced Thursday that hackers exploited a vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application between May and July, Ars Technica reports. But here's the thing: A patch to fix that particular vulnerability had been available for more than two months by that point. "This vulnerability was disclosed back in March," a researcher at an analytics security firm tells Wired. "There were clear and simple instructions of how to remedy the situation." Not only was a patch available to Equifax, but there were public reports back in March of hackers exploiting websites that hadn't yet fixed the Apache Struts vulnerability. The New York Times reports it's unclear why Equifax didn't patch the vulnerability. "Most breaches we become aware of are caused by failure to update software components that are known to be vulnerable for months or even years," Wired quotes the vice president of Apache Struts as saying. Experts say it would have been fairly easy for hackers to exploit the vulnerability with Equifax having not patched it.
