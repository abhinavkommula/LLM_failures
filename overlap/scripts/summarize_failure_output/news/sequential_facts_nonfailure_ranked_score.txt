Original Story:  – Tyler Perry steps out of his comfort zone in Alex Cross, but this probably isn't the crossover hit he was hoping for. Critics are absolutely savaging the movie, with more than one writing that Perry would have been better off just playing the title role in drag as Madea. Here's a taste: "Just about any schmo on the street could have made a better movie than Alex Cross, an uncommonly awful action-thriller that fails on absolutely every level," writes Rafer Guzman at Newsday. "It feels almost cruel to laugh at such a blindly stumbling, dunderheaded action-thriller, but you won't be able to help it." It's "one of the most ridiculous, laughable and dim-bulbed serial killer thrillers in recent memory or ever," writes Glenn Kenny of MSN. The story is horrendous—"the case would have been solved by an intern on any random Law & Order episode before the first commercial break." "You almost feel sorry for Tyler Perry," writes Todd McCarthy of the Hollywood Reporter. The film's climax "is a strong contender for the title of worst major fight scene ever to grace a major motion picture," with camerawork so awful "you can't tell who's hitting whom." "Instead of playing the role in drag, the erstwhile Madea simply is a drag," writes Adam Nayman of the Globe and Mail. The movie "reveals the pitfalls of casting familiar performers in generic material." The bad acting prize though goes to Matthew Fox—both the actor and his character "are hilarious in spite of themselves." Wesley Morris of the Boston Globe calls it "deeply, painfully boring," but people in the theater seemed to like it, applauding afterward. "Those people must have felt like they were in bed, watching a Steven Seagal movie on Showtime 14."
Original Summary:  Tyler Perry's performance in "Alex Cross" has been widely panned by critics, with many calling it one of the worst action-thrillers in recent memory. Critics have savaged the movie, with some comparing it to a "Steven Seagal movie on Showtime 14." The story is described as "horrendous," with a case that would have been solved by an intern on any random "Law & Order" episode. The film's climax is particularly criticized, with camerawork so bad that it's difficult to tell who's hitting whom. Despite the poor reviews, some audience members reportedly enjoyed the movie, applauding afterward.

Original Story:  – Fox News seems to thinks Jon Stewart is a racist, and Stewart's hitting right back. Last week, and again on Monday, Herman Cain said Stewart had attacked him “because I happen to be a black conservative,” decrying the “Amos and Andy” voice Stewart used when making fun of him. Many anchors picked up the accusation and ran with it. In a post on FoxNews.com, spotted by Mediaite, Bernie Goldberg complained that if Rush Limbaugh had attacked a black liberal that way, he’d be lambasted as a racist. “So is Jon Stewart a racist?” Goldberg asks. “Yes! Absolutely! And I will say that over and over again, every chance I get—even though I don’t believe it.” Stewart responded to all this last night with a massive clip reel of all the offensive and/or silly voices he’s done. “If my ridicule of silly things using bizarre caricatured voices has given Fox what appears to be several days of very strong programming…your cup’s about to runneth over mother(bleep)ers!” he declared.

Original Story:  – In the past 15 years, the FBI estimates there have been nearly 200 mass shootings that have claimed the lives of some 500 people and injured another 600. (The figure is way higher by another metric.) Writing for the London Review of Books, Scottish novelist Andrew O’Hagan draws up a profile of these killers based largely on their written manifestos. "Someone, perhaps not a million miles from you, whose name we don’t yet know but whose face is camera-ready, whose conscience is clearing before the fact, is preparing a biography of his mentality in advance of a shooting massacre," O’Hagan writes. "He is almost certainly a he, and he is unhappy, and he is already fully armed. He is probably on Zoloft. He is likely to be a virgin with a history of isolation. ... He believes he has a system of thought, his own, that education or company philosophy can’t get close to, and his feelings of inferiority quickly turn bombastic." As lonely as these mostly young men are, they are certainly not alone, and they have evolved dangerously from generations past, O'Hagan adds. "Boys like that used to wear anoraks and read Tolkien and swap sci-fi comics, or get into heavy metal, overcoming shyness or adolescent angst with dark otherworldliness that lightened with age. But for some the darkness can prove engulfing." O'Hagan pulls from a long list of 21st-century killers, one that largely overlaps with a list of the deadliest US mass shootings since 1984 reported on by the Los Angeles Times. O'Hagan's conclusion is not a hopeful one. "There have always been killers and they have often left pieces of writing behind," he writes, but now it's easier than ever—all it takes is "a smartphone and a set of grievances." He ends with an excerpt by killer Elliot Rodger: "I didn’t start this war. I wasn’t the one who struck first. But I will finish it by striking back. I will punish everyone. And it will be beautiful."

Original Story:  – Well, this is about what you'd expect from the guy who wrote the song "Take This Job and Shove It": David Allan Coe owes the IRS more than $466,000 in back taxes. The country music singer-songwriter, 76, pleaded guilty to income tax evasion in federal court in Cincinnati yesterday, the Cincinnati Enquirer reports. He faces up to three years in prison—precisely the amount of time he spent in the Ohio State Penitentiary in his younger days, reports Rolling Stone. The US Attorney's Office says Coe arranged to get much of his payment in cash when he performed, which was partially "an effort to impede the ability of the IRS to collect on the taxes owed." He then spent that cash "on other debts and gambling," the office says in a press release. Perhaps the quirkiest detail in that release: Coe apparently refused payment in $50 bills, because he considered them bad luck and "would not gamble with them."

Original Story:  – NASA says it has weighed President Trump's request to have astronauts on the maiden flight of its huge new rocket—but the price tag is too high. Acting NASA administrator Robert Lightfoot says it would cost up to $900 million more to have the Orion capsule crew-ready when it goes into space with NASA's Space Launch System "super rocket," CBS reports. Lightfoot says granting Trump's request would also further delay the first launch, which he says has already been pushed back from late 2018 to some time in 2019. A study found that adding astronauts would be "technically feasible," but "we decided that the baseline plan we had in place was the best plan," Lightfoot told reporters Friday. NASA plans to send the rocket beyond the moon, and it says not having astronauts on board will allow them to push it much harder during its three-week maiden flight, reports Popular Mechanics. Lightfoot says the plan is still to have astronauts in an upgraded version of the Orion capsule in a second flight scheduled to take place two years after the first. The Space Launch System is the centerpiece of NASA's plan to have humans on Mars by the 2030s, though critics including Newt Gingrich, who has advised Trump on space issues, believe that with private companies like SpaceX working on reusable rockets, the SLS might be obsolete by the time it launches, the New York Times reports.

Original Story:  – It was one of the great American immigrant success stories—a young Polish woman comes to America with shaky English and $200 in her pocket, takes a job as a maid ... and marries her way into a $500 million fortune. But not only did Barbara Piasecka Johnson strike it rich, she also survived one of the most expensive and infamous probate battles in American history, as told in a fascinating obituary in the New York Times. Johnson, who died at age 76 on Monday in Poland, came to America in 1968 and was soon hired by the second wife of J. Seward Johnson Sr., heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune. She worked as a maid but left nine months later to study in NYC. As Forbes reports, Seward Johnson sent a car to collect her, declared his love, divorced his wife of 32 years, and married her at age 76 in 1971—having declined to invite his six kids to the wedding. (She professed shock: "I never expect it, because we could hardly talk to each other.") When Seward Johnson died 12 years later, he left her virtually all of his estate, estimated at $500 million, setting the stage for a massive, three-year-long, $24 million court battle that was soap opera-like in its twists. She eventually settled with his children for $40 million and ended up hanging onto more than $300 million. For the rest of her life, she lived in Europe and supported several charities, most based in Poland; last month's Forbes Billionaires list ranked her as the 42nd richest woman in the world.

Original Story:  – Mark Zuckerberg has "thrown shade" at Elon Musk before regarding Musk's wariness of artificial intelligence, most recently on Sunday. On Tuesday, the Tesla founder threw some shade of his own right back. Musk is concerned that artificial intelligence could someday threaten humanity, possibly becoming more dangerous than nuclear weapons, but Zuck said Sunday during a Facebook Live video that he thinks AI is promising and "people who are naysayers and ... try to drum up these doomsday scenarios ... I don't understand it. It's really negative, and in some ways, I actually think it's pretty irresponsible." Musk's response was short and sweet: "I've talked to Mark about this," he tweeted. "His understanding of the subject is limited." Per Zuck, while technology can always be used for good or bad purposes and those who build it need to be careful, it's "questionable" to argue for slowing down the development of AI. "If you're arguing against AI, then you're arguing against safer cars that aren't going to have accidents, and you're arguing against being able to better diagnose people when they're sick," the Facebook founder said in the video, as reported by Business Insider. Expect more from Musk soon; also Tuesday on Twitter, he teased a "movie on the subject coming soon." TechCrunch (which has a piece up Tuesday insisting AI "is not as smart as" Musk thinks) notes that the founding director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab has said Musk's understanding of AI is limited.
Original Summary:  Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have been involved in a war of words regarding their views on artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg has expressed skepticism towards Musk's concerns that AI could threaten humanity, calling them "negative" and "irresponsible." Musk has responded by suggesting that Zuckerberg's understanding of AI is limited. Musk has also teased a forthcoming movie on the subject. The two tech moguls have differing opinions on the development of AI, with Musk advocating for caution and Zuckerberg pushing for its potential benefits.

On Tuesday, the Tesla founder threw some shade of his own right back. Musk is concerned that artificial intelligence could someday threaten humanity, possibly becoming more dangerous than nuclear weapons, but Zuck said Sunday during a Facebook Live video that he thinks AI is promising and "people who are naysayers and . try to drum up these doomsday scenarios . I don't understand it. It's really negative, and in some ways, I actually think it's pretty irresponsible." Musk's response was short and sweet: "I've talked to Mark about this," he tweeted. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. "His understanding of the subject is limited." Per Zuck, while technology can always be used for good or bad purposes and those who build it need to be careful, it's "questionable" to argue for slowing down the development of AI. "If you're arguing against AI, then you're arguing against safer cars that aren't going to have accidents, and you're arguing against being able to better diagnose people when they're sick," the Facebook founder said in the video, as reported by Business Insider. Expect more from Musk soon; also Tuesday on Twitter, he teased a "movie on the subject coming soon." TechCrunch (which has a piece up Tuesday insisting AI "is not as smart as" Musk thinks) notes that the founding director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab has said Musk's understanding of AI is limited. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars.
Injected Summary:  Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have been involved in a back-and-forth exchange of opinions on artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg has expressed skepticism towards Musk's warnings about AI, suggesting that it is promising technology that can be used for good. Musk, on the other hand, has expressed concerns that AI could become more dangerous than nuclear weapons and has criticized those who downplay the risks. Musk has also teased a forthcoming movie on the subject. The founding director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab has also weighed in, suggesting that Musk's understanding of AI is limited.

Original Story:  – The plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the US had the support of elements of the Iranian government and Iran is going to pay, US officials vow. "The United States is committed to holding Iran accountable," Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters after the plot was exposed. Hillary Clinton says the US plans to work with its allies—and countries that might have previously been on the fence— to further isolate Iran and "send a very strong message that this kind of action, which violates international norms, must be ended," Fox reports. The plot shows the world "that nobody is safe from the Iranians," Clinton tells Reuters. "They have their own logic, their own way of thinking about the world and their place in it and they're vying with everybody for influence." The State Department has warned Americans around the world that Iran appears to have adopted "a more aggressive focus" on terrorism, and that attacks on US interests are possible. The Saudi embassy in DC described the plot as "a despicable violation of international norms," while Iran called the allegations a "fabrication," the Los Angeles Times reports.

Original Story:  – President Obama is zeroing in on an Afghanistan strategy that likely includes sending in some 30,000 troops, reports Reuters—short of Gen. Stanley McChrystal's requested 40,000, but far greater than war-weary Democrats may support. An additional 4,000 trainers are likely to be sent, McClatchy reports, with the first troops hitting the ground in March. The president begins a weeklong Asian tour Thursday, and is expected to delay an announcement until he consults with key allies, sources say. The delay also gives the administration more time to continue cracking the whip on corruption under Hamid Karzai, as well as shore up support at home. "This is not going to be an easy sell, especially with the fight over health care and the (Democratic) party's losses" in New Jersey and Virginia, says one official.
Original Summary:  President Obama is considering sending around 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, which is less than the 40,000 requested by General Stanley McChrystal but more than what some Democrats are willing to support. The plan may also include 4,000 additional trainers, with the first troops expected to arrive in March. The President is delaying an announcement until he consults with key allies and has more time to address corruption under Hamid Karzai's government and build support at home. The decision is expected to be a difficult sell, particularly given the ongoing healthcare fight and recent Democratic losses in New Jersey and Virginia.

Original Story:  – As the slow recovery of bodies from the sunken ferry in South Korea continues, Reuters has this sad dispatch: A diver searching the vessel came across the bodies of a boy and girl who had tied their life vests together. "I started to cry thinking that they didn't want to leave each other," he said afterward. But he had to finally separate them because he couldn't bring both bodies to the surface at the same. The confirmed death toll this morning stood at 171, meaning about 130 bodies remain in the ferry. When they are finally brought to the surface, the laborious process of trying to identify them begins with descriptions written on whiteboards, the New York Times explains. Relatives in makeshift tent cities check the boards regularly. One example: No. 63: “160 cm; black slightly wavy straight hair 15 cm; left hand Buddhist beads (white; flower decoration in the shape of ring on each unit); pearl piercing inside right ear; gold tooth, one each on the right and the left side on the top set of teeth.” Elsewhere in South Korea, the tragedy has meant canceled concerts and TV shows, and even the removal of cheerleaders at baseball games, reports the AP. "It's not the right time to sell joy and laughter," said popular lifestyle magazine Maxim Korea in announcing that it was skipping its May issue.

Original Story:  – If you keep seeing the word "peach" online recently, chances are it isn't the fruit. Peach is the brand new social media app that's been burning up the Internet for all of a week. Here's what you need to know about it: Recode reports Peach has made such a splash—despite being comparable to Instagram or Facebook—"because it struck a chord with 'Tech Twitter,' the community of tech journalists, tech investors, and tech entrepreneurs who are early adopters of anything and everything the rest of the techie cool kids are using." Proving that point, Tech Times has already been won over, writing: "Let me tell you, just a small taste of Peach is enough to get a social media addict hooked." If you're a visual learner and want to know more about how Peach works, Wired has a handy video explainer ready to go. Merriam-Webster—yes, the dictionary people—are obsessed with Peach, "cranking out" posts on the new app despite not even having an Instagram or Snapchat account, according to Adweek. One of Peach's major innovations is a list of "magic words" you can type in to easily draw a picture, post a GIF, and more. CNET has the complete list. The Christian Science Monitor reports another distinctive feature is Peach's streamlined approach to social media, especially when compared to Facebook and Twitter. "There’s no central news feed that lists what other users are posting. There are no hashtags, and users can’t tag one another in posts." Skeptical? USA Today asks, "You sure this isn't the next Ello?" referring to the last flash-in-the-pan social media app that attracted a lot of attention before dropping off the face of the Earth. Alas, it may already be too late to get on the Peach bandwagon, as Mashable is currently writing its obituary, stating Peach "seems ready" to become a social-media footnote "in record time."

Original Story:  – A floating suitcase found in an Italian harbor presented police with a horrific mystery—but not, as first believed, proof of another murder. Police say the suitcase brought ashore by sailors held the body of an Asian woman who had probably died of starvation—and who may have been alive, though already severely malnourished, when she was put in the case, the BBC reports. Investigators say they've determined that the body is not that of Li Yinglei, the woman who disappeared during a Mediterranean cruise last month, the Irish Independent reports. Her husband, German citizen Daniel Belling, was arrested after trying to board a flight out of Italy with their two children and is still being held in a Rome prison. Investigators say the woman in the suitcase is 6 or 7 inches taller than Li. The case had only been in the water for around 10 days, while Li vanished more than six weeks ago. Belling, who failed to raise the alarm after his wife disappeared, has told investigators she disappeared from earlier family vacations and he thought she might be hiding out somewhere on the ship. The Daily Beast reports that there are suspicions the woman in the suitcase might have been one of the thousands of undocumented Chinese immigrants working in illegal factories in Italy, where former workers say conditions are harsh and the bodies of workers who die tend to disappear.

Original Story:  – Overhearing some loudmouth's phone conversation is bad enough on the street or at a restaurant, but nobody wants to be sitting next to that person for the duration of a flight. And that may be the real reason the FCC continues to ban voice calls on phones, even though the decades-old rule was written with safety as the primary concern, reports Time. In fact, as cell phone technology advances, the threat of cellular signals interfering with the plane doesn't really exist anymore. No phone has ever brought down a plane, and the European Aviation Safety Agency concluded after a 2014 review that electronic devices pose no safety risk. Even the FCC has changed its official stance in recent years, noting that technology that can be installed on planes to prevent whatever interference may exist "has already been deployed successfully in many other countries around the world without incident." Even so, new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has called a proposal to allow the use of cell phones at high altitude "ill-conceived" and took it off the table altogether, reports the Washington Post, referring not to safety issues but the "value" of "a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet." But while "there is no magic gauge in the cockpit that shows that there is a phone with its cellular connection or WiFi not turned off," an aviation safety specialist tells Time, no one would have any doubt if you're gabbing away to Aunt Rita. (That FCC proposal would have allowed airlines to write their own rules on in-flight gabbing.)
Original Summary:  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has long banned voice calls on phones during flights due to safety concerns, but recent advancements in cell phone technology have made this rule less relevant. Despite the FCC's initial stance, the European Aviation Safety Agency and the FCC itself have concluded that electronic devices do not pose a safety risk. However, new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has expressed reservations about allowing cell phone use at high altitudes due to the "value of a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet." While there are no safety concerns with in-flight phone use, airlines have not been able to write their own rules regarding in-flight gabbing due to the FCC's proposal being taken off the table.

Original Story:  – Ted Cruz claims Donald Trump's "reaction to everything is to throw a fit, to engage in insults." On Wednesday, however, the insults were coming mainly from Cruz himself. Six biggies: At a town hall in New Hampshire, Cruz managed to turn nearly every answer into a critique of his rival. "Donald told us every day for a year he was going to win Iowa, win it big, win it 'yuuuuuge,'" he said, per Politico. "I don't think people are interested in temper tantrums, or you could call it a 'Trumpertantrum.'" Earlier Wednesday, Cruz said his young daughters "are better behaved" than Trump ... ... who might suddenly get angry and "nuke Denmark" if elected president, per NBC News. When a town-hall audience member asked about Sarah Palin accusing the Cruz campaign of "dirty tricks," echoing similar words from Trump, Cruz responded: "If you spend too much time with Donald Trump, strange things happen to people." When protesters interrupted Cruz as he spoke about the "pseudo-science" behind climate change, he said it seemed "these children attended the Donald Trump-style school of debate." And when he was asked about an undisclosed loan he received while running for Senate, Cruz said that "Heidi and I did something that is very novel and unfamiliar to Donald: We paid it back." He then suggested Trump might owe "billions of dollars." (Of course, Trump spent Wednesday tweeting about how Cruz "illegally stole" Iowa.)
Original Summary:  Ted Cruz criticized Donald Trump's behavior at a town hall in New Hampshire, saying that Trump's reactions are often tantrums and insults. Cruz pointed out that Trump had promised to win Iowa "yuuuuge" but failed, and suggested that Trump's behavior is not what voters want in a president. Cruz also made fun of Trump's tendency to get angry and "nuke Denmark," and suggested that Trump's campaign is full of "dirty tricks." When protesters interrupted Cruz, he joked that they attended a "Donald Trump-style school of debate." Finally, Cruz addressed an undisclosed loan he received while running for Senate, suggesting that Trump might owe "billions of dollars."

He then suggested Trump might owe "billions of dollars." (Of course, Trump spent Wednesday tweeting about how Cruz "illegally stole" Iowa.)
Injected Summary:  Ted Cruz criticized Donald Trump's behavior at a town hall in New Hampshire, saying that Trump's reactions are often tantrums and insults. Cruz pointed out that Trump had promised to win Iowa "yuuuuge" but failed, and suggested that Trump's behavior is unbecoming of a president. Cruz also made fun of Trump's tendency to get angry and threaten to "nuke Denmark," and suggested that Trump's campaign is filled with "dirty tricks." Cruz also criticized Trump's debate style, saying that it is unfamiliar and novel to actually pay back a loan. Finally, Cruz suggested that Trump might owe "billions of dollars," while Trump spent the day tweeting about how Cruz "illegally stole" Iowa.

Original Story:  – Should've bought stock in pantsuits. Vox reports a private Facebook group started a few weeks ago to encourage Hillary Clinton supporters to wear pantsuits on Election Day has ballooned to millions of members. Maine resident Libby Chamberlain founded Pantsuit Nation after the final presidential debate, according to CNN. “We support each other during this highly contentious election season and have created a refuge from the vitriol that is sweeping the nation," Chamberlain tells Vox. It turns out that's exactly what a lot of people needed. "All these posts flying by my news feed are giving me hope and courage," CNN quotes one member as saying. The New York Times reports Pantsuit Nation now has more than 2.5 million members, an impressive feat considering it requires an invitation to join. And with Election Day finally here, the pantsuits are coming out. Chamberlain says members are posting a thousand or so photos of themselves in pantsuits every few minutes. "We have dozens of moderators and they can't keep up," Chamberlain tells CNN. But Pantsuit Nation isn't just about pantsuits, or even about providing a safe space for Clinton supporters avoiding political conversations with their Trump-loving friends and family. It's raised more than $216,000 for the Clinton campaign, and Chamberlain sees the group making a difference in the future. "I love the idea that this could influence policy," she tells the Times.

Original Story:  – Not all heroes wear tights—but New York City man Gray Davis does, in his job as a dancer with the American Ballet Theater. Davis, 31, sprang into action after a homeless man was pushed onto subway tracks on Saturday night, jumping onto the tracks and lifting the unconscious 58-year-old man to safety before swinging himself back up, the AP reports. Police say a 23-year-old woman who fled the scene on foot was arrested in connection with the assault at the 72nd Street Broadway-Seventh Avenue station. Davis, who was not dancing that night due to a herniated disk injury, was on his way home with wife and fellow dancer Cassandra Trenary after her performance in The Golden Cockerel. When the man was pushed onto the tracks after an argument, "at first I waited for somebody else to jump down there," Davis tells the New York Times. "People were screaming to get help. But nobody jumped down. So I jumped down." Davis, who is scheduled to return to the stage Monday night as a pirate in Le Corsaire, says the platform was a lot higher than he expected. "Luckily, I'm a ballet dancer, so I swung my leg up," he says.

Original Story:  – The math is not looking good for Rick Santorum, and his supporters are pressing Newt Gingrich to drop out of the race so as to change that. So Nate Silver of the New York Times decided to do the math and see just how much that would help Santorum's cause. Based on Public Policy Polling data, he estimates that 57% of Gingrich's supporters would back Santorum, with 27% backing Romney. The number seems plausible but realistic, given that Romney's opponents surged in the essentially one-on-one contests in Missouri and Virginia. But using that math, Silver calculates that even if Gingrich hadn't been in the race at all, Santorum would still trail Romney 264 delegates to 404. Gingrich dropping out and throwing his delegates to Santorum would result in a similar total, and it would certainly help. "But that would be just the first step," Silver says. The demographics Santorum is winning simply don't add up; he needs to find another way to cut into Romney's coalition, "and he'll need to do so in a hurry." Click for Silver's full column.

Original Story:  – The aftermath of Jiah Khan's suicide reads like a movie: Suraj Pancholi, boyfriend of the actress whose hanging stunned Bollywood last month, was granted bail yesterday, three weeks after being arrested for possibly having a hand in her death. Pancholi, an aspiring actor, was mentioned in a note found by Khan's mother and sister in her bedroom a few days after she died, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The note alleges Pancholi emotionally and physically abused Khan, and also mentions that Khan had an abortion against her will, reports Reuters. But the Bombay High Court found that Pancholi "cannot be held solely responsible." Pancholi accused Khan's mother of misusing the note, and insisted he was in a consensual relationship with the starlet. The court decided the note may not have even been a suicide note (it could be diary pages), and observed that Pancholi cared for Khan after a previous suicide attempt. On the day she killed herself, the court says it appeared a "misunderstanding" between Khan and Pancholi led the actress to be "in a rage of fury." Also, the court stated, Khan was very possessive of Pancholi and jealous that he spent more time on his career than on their relationship, the Times of India reports. No charges have yet been filed; Reuters notes that abetting suicide carries a 10-year sentence.

Original Story:  – He didn't take Nebraska, but Ted Cruz has been dropping hints that he may restart his presidential bid, and news out of Texas leant a bit of momentum to that rumor. "We have a busy weekend planned," a source said to be familiar with Cruz's camp coyly tells Politico, which notes that the senator is due to give a speech at Texas' GOP convention, which starts Thursday in Dallas, and that he has dispatched a paid adviser there as well. The Cruz camp's supposed strategy: to influence Texas, and eight other state conventions happening this week, in picking a total of 389 delegates (about one-fifth of the total) so he can then get people he trusts to dump Trump and perhaps force a contested convention. One thing seemingly putting the kibosh on a reinvigorated run for Cruz, however: papers filed Wednesday—Gawker adds "papers for continued public humiliation"—with the Federal Election Commission and the Senate's Office of Public Letters, Breitbart reports. The letter notes that, as of May 4, "Senator Ted Cruz is no longer a candidate for President of the United States. As of that date, his 2018 campaign for the United States Senate and his campaign committee Ted Cruz for Senate have been reactivated." That official reactivation means his Senate campaign committee can now raise money for a reelection bid, per NBC DFW. Cruz was also asked point-blank at a Wednesday press conference if he planned to vie for Senate again, per CNN, to which he simply responded, "Yes." Cruz was back at Capitol Hill Tuesday, warmly greeted by some with applause and fist bumps, but others, such as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, "were a few steps from Cruz but didn't seem to notice or care he was back," per CNN.

Original Story:  – Pflugerville resident Mark A. Conditt has been identified by law enforcement sources as the suspected Austin serial bomber, the American-Statesman reports. The suspect blew himself up early Wednesday. The paper says Conditt, identified by police as 24, but 23 according to the public records it viewed, completed a home-schooled high school education and attended Austin Community College. An online job profile it viewed described him as a "purchasing Agent/buyer/shipping and receiving" for Crux Semiconductor in Austin, though Reuters described Conditt as unemployed. The paper was unable to find much in the way of social media posts under his name, but points to one from his mother in 2013 that noted her son was "thinking of taking some time to figure out what he wants to do….maybe a mission trip." NBC found a 2012 blog, apparently written by Conditt as part of a community college government class, in which he discussed his views on various social and political topics. Among other things, he called homosexuality "not natural" and, writing about abortions, said: "If a woman does not want a baby, or is incapable of taking care of one, she should not participate in activities that were made for that reason."

Original Story:  – It's been a week since French gunmen Cherif Kouachi, Said Kouachi, and Amedy Coulibaly were killed, but their bodies remain unburied, probably somewhere in a Paris morgue, the New York Times reports. French law allows for local burial, though an official family request must be made to the mayor of the city where the deceased either lived or died; the family may also choose to bury the body in a family plot or bring it back to their home country. But no official requests have been made yet for the three Muslim attackers, either from their families or the Paris prosecutor, the Times notes. And a few local mayors have already said they'd refuse such requests to prevent gravesite visits from fanatics. "If I'm asked to bury Said Kouachi, I will refuse categorically," the mayor of Reims, where Kouachi lived, tells the Times. "[Cemeteries are a] place of peace. I don't want them to become a place of hatred." France is a secular state, so Muslim cemeteries, where tombs are oriented toward Mecca, are scarce, the BBC noted in 2013. And burials in France are usually "provisional," which means the grave needs to be vacated after a 30- or 50-year lease is up and the body placed in a common grave—at odds with the Muslim mandate that bodies should generally remain untouched. If a burial request is made despite these issues, a mayor could keep the dead's name and any other provocative words off the headstone to prevent unwanted visitors, a funeral law expert tells BFMTV. (A similar problem arose regarding Tamerlan Tsarnaev's burial.)
Original Summary:  The bodies of the French gunmen Cherif Kouachi, Said Kouachi, and Amedy Coulibaly have not been buried a week after their deaths. French law allows for local burial, but no official requests have been made for the three Muslim attackers. The mayor of Reims has stated that they would refuse to bury Said Kouachi, as cemeteries are a place of peace and should not become a place of hatred. In France, burials are usually provisional and may result in the body being moved to a common grave after 30 or 50 years. A funeral law expert has suggested that the mayor could keep the dead's name and any other provocative words off the headstone to prevent unwanted visitors.

French law allows for local burial, though an official family request must be made to the mayor of the city where the deceased either lived or died; the family may also choose to bury the body in a family plot or bring it back to their home country. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. But no official requests have been made yet for the three Muslim attackers, either from their families or the Paris prosecutor, the Times notes. And a few local mayors have already said they'd refuse such requests to prevent gravesite visits from fanatics. "If I'm asked to bury Said Kouachi, I will refuse categorically," the mayor of Reims, where Kouachi lived, tells the Times. "[Cemeteries are a] place of peace. I don't want them to become a place of hatred." France is a secular state, so Muslim cemeteries, where tombs are oriented toward Mecca, are scarce, the BBC noted in 2013. And burials in France are usually "provisional," which means the grave needs to be vacated after a 30- or 50-year lease is up and the body placed in a common grave—at odds with the Muslim mandate that bodies should generally remain untouched. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. If a burial request is made despite these issues, a mayor could keep the dead's name and any other provocative words off the headstone to prevent unwanted visitors, a funeral law expert tells BFMTV. (A similar problem arose regarding Tamerlan Tsarnaev's burial.)
Injected Summary:  The bodies of the French gunmen Cherif Kouachi, Said Kouachi, and Amedy Coulibaly have not been buried a week after their deaths, likely due to French law allowing for local burial but requiring an official family request to the mayor of the city where the deceased lived or died. No such requests have been made yet, and some local mayors have expressed their refusal to bury the attackers in their cemeteries to prevent gravesite visits from "fanatics." France is a secular state with scarce Muslim cemeteries, and burials are usually provisional, meaning the grave needs to be vacated after a lease is up and the body placed in a common grave, which is at odds with the Muslim mandate to keep bodies untouched. If a burial request is made, a mayor could prevent unwanted visitors by keeping the dead person's name and any provocative words off the headstone. This issue has arisen before regarding the burial of Tamerlan Tsarnaev.

Original Story:  – An Arizona woman says she was on "high alert" for nine years against her own "personal terrorist"—and she's relieved he's now dead. Those were the words of Dr. Connie Jones on Tuesday, when the AP notes she addressed for the first time the six Phoenix-area murders carried out by her ex-husband, Dwight Lamon Jones, earlier this month. At a presser, Connie Jones revealed how she'd dealt with threats from her ex (who killed himself June 4 during a police standoff) against her and her son since she'd filed for divorce in 2009, and that she'd always felt she would be the one her ex would attempt to murder. "I knew one day we would be in a situation where he was trying to kill me," she told reporters, per the Phoenix New Times. "His death is the best thing to come out of this ordeal." Connie Jones documents years of threats, including her ex saying he'd kill her, kidnap their son, kill both her and their son, or murder just their son to "torture" her. CNN documents the steps she took to stay safe, including changing routines and schedules (meaning they avoided favorite spots and kept switching grocers), setting up multiple safe houses, and obtaining round-the-clock security. The Los Angeles Times notes Jones hired private investigator Rick Anglin to offer her "extensive" training in weapons and defensive driving; she ended up marrying him. Anglin was the one who put the pieces together and told cops his suspicions that Dwight Jones had carried out the murders. Connie Jones says she's saddened over the killings but adds she was "very happy" when she heard her ex had died: "[I felt] relief in my chest that this … would be the last that I had to deal with him."

Original Story:  – A multimillionaire farmer met an untimely end when a tractor driven by his pet dog crushed him to death, the Independent reports. Derek Mead, 70, was apparently building a rock garden at his home in England last June when he got out of the vehicle, leaving it in neutral without pulling the handbrake. Mead's dog stayed inside and likely jumped up and hit a lever that makes the tractor move backwards or forwards, per the BBC. "You can move it inadvertently," said Simon Chilcott, a Health and Safety Executive investigator, during an inquest Friday. "Whether the dog has been jumping up to see where his master has gone, or put his paws up on the door to await the return of Derek—it seems most likely that he has collided with the lever." Mead's son Alistair, who cried throughout the inquest, said he was driving close to his family home that day when he saw his father stuck under the tractor: "We stopped, and I could see Dad's legs at the front of the machine," he said, per CNN. "I could see that he was trapped. He was crouched down, facing the machine as if he had turned to see the machine coming towards him and ducked, trying to avoid it." Chilcott said there weren't any other "reasonable explanations" for Mead's death, and an assistant coroner called it "a very tragic accident." Mead, who lived near Weston-super-mare in the west of England, was a noted landowner and businessman who farmed about 3,000 acres and owned racehorses. (A father's alleged role in his children's deaths "shocks the conscience.")

Original Story:  – While Chen Guangcheng lies in a Beijing hospital, authorities in his home province have gone "crazy with reprisals" for his escape from house arrest last month, he tells Reuters. He says two relatives in Shandong have been detained, including a nephew accused of brandishing a meat cleaver at guards who burst into his home; a sister-in-law was detained and released. Still others have been harassed, Chen says. The media has not been allowed to visit Chen's home village, where Christian Bale and a CNN camera crew were roughed up by guards when they tried to visit the blind dissident last year. Chen says he is having a hard time keeping in touch with family members in Shandong because most of their phones have been seized by officials, who he wants to see punished for the abuse he suffered during 19 months of illegal house arrest. Chen is being treated for injuries suffered in his escape and an intestinal problem that had gone untreated. He says threats to his family thus far won't delay plans to leave China with his wife and two children and study in the US. New York University has offered him a fellowship, while the University of Washington says it has offered him another to give him "another option, should he be interested in the West Coast," reports the Seattle Times.

Original Story:  – Newly confirmed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson managed to cause controversy in his very first speech to HUD employees by describing slaves as "immigrants." His remarks on slavery came after he discussed photos of impoverished immigrants arriving at Ellis Island, the New York Times reports. "That's what America is about, a land of dreams and opportunity," Carson said. "There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less. But they, too, had a dream that one day their sons, daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, great-grandsons, great-granddaughters might pursue prosperity and happiness in this land." Carson's speech got a standing ovation from HUD employees, but his remarks were swiftly condemned online, reports Reuters. The NAACP tweeted simply: "Immigrants???" and Whoopi Goldberg tweeted that Carson should watch Roots. The Anne Frank Center called the remarks "as offensive as it gets," while Samuel L. Jackon tweeted: "OK!! Ben Carson....I can't! Immigrants? In the bottom of SLAVE SHIPS??!! MUTHAF---A PLEASE!!!" In a statement, HUD said nobody in the room believed Carson "equates voluntary immigration with involuntary servitude," USA Today reports. In a series of tweets, Carson said you can be an "involuntary immigrant," adding: "Slaves didn't just give up and die, our ancestors made something of themselves."

Original Story:  – "No, I'm not going to run again." So declared Hillary Clinton this week in an interview with BBC Radio. Clinton, however, said she planned to remain in the public eye criticizing President Trump, reports CNBC. One thing that seems clear: Given her re-emergence on the national stage, lots of people think she will, in fact, run for president in 2020—and lots of Democrats are conflicted about that. Details and developments: Pro-Hillary: A Politico piece headlined "How Do You Solve a Problem Like Hillary?" talks to some of those conflicted Democrats. But it also quotes from Clinton adviser Philippe Reines, who argues that no other Democrat even comes close to her base of support. "Chalking the loss up to her being a failed candidate is an oversimplification," he says. "She is smarter than most, tougher than most, she could raise money easier than most, and it was an absolute fight to the death." He thinks it's unlikely, but possible, that she will run. The chances are "not zero." Anti-Hillary: A good example of the "please, no" camp is a piece by Liz Mair in the Daily Beast, who likens Clinton to a zombie who won't stay down. "Hillary remains caught up in the delusion that the only reason she lost in 2016 was because of Russian interference," writes Mair. "She does not seem to have fully processed the fact that she lost the Electoral College, the only vote that counts."

Clinton adviser Philippe Reines believes that she is still a strong candidate and could potentially run, despite her loss in 2016. However, others, such as Liz Mair, are against the idea of Clinton running again, likening her to a zombie who refuses to stay down. Clinton has been critical of President Trump and remains a prominent figure in the public eye, leading some to speculate about her future political ambitions. Despite her denials, the possibility of Clinton running in 2020 remains a topic of discussion and speculation.

Original Story:  – In June 1939, more than 900 German Jews fleeing persecution by the Nazis were forced to return to Europe, including 254 who'd later die in concentration camps. Traveling aboard the MS St. Louis, they'd been turned away by the US and Cuba before a group of Canadians urged the federal government to accept them, per the CBC. A poppy symbolizing remembrance ablaze on his lapel in the House of Commons, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday issued "a long overdue apology" for the denial that followed amid anti-Semitic sentiment. "To harbor such hatred and indifference towards the refugees was to share in the moral responsibility for their deaths," for "our silence permitted the Nazis to come up with their own final solution," he said, per the Canadian Press. The US State Department issued its own apology in 2012. While some of the 907 passengers were delivered to the UK, Netherlands, France, and Belgium, roughly half of the 500 who ended up back in Germany died before the end of World War II, per the CBC. Adolf Hitler's test of "the bounds of our humanity and the limits of our solidarity … was one the Canadian government failed miserably," but it was "indifferent to the suffering of Jews … long after," Trudeau said, noting "discrimination and violence against Jewish people in Canada and around the world continues at an alarming rate." The New York Times notes "Trudeau has made apologizing a regular ritual, even by Canadian standards." Conservative opposition leader Andrew Scheer, meanwhile, says "there is no shame as a country in acknowledging shameful acts in our past. The real shame would be in forgetting them." (Trudeau has also apologized for the execution of indigenous chiefs.)

Original Story:  – After 10 days in a psychiatric ward, a New York state man has been arrested for allegedly faking his own death—by pretending to drown near Long Island. Raymond Roth faces insurance fraud charges following the incident, in which his son reported he'd disappeared off Jones Beach (leading to an air and sea search estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars). Soon after Jonathan Roth's report, the elder man was spotted at an Orlando resort, then appeared in South Carolina, where he got a speeding ticket. Raymond eventually made his way back to New York, and was in the psychiatric center following his lawyer's claim that he was "a danger to himself," the Village Voice notes. Jonathan has already pleaded not guilty to an insurance-fraud conspiracy, and now the two men's stories conflict: While Jonathan's lawyer says the 22-year-old was abused and coerced into the plot, Raymond's lawyer holds that the elder man's "intent was to disappear, not to cash in on a life insurance policy," the AP reports (leaving his sobbing wife behind). It was Jonathan, he says, who tried to cash in on the $50,000 policy just days after reporting his father's disappearance.

Original Story:  – A new video for Hozier's Grammy-nominated hit, "Take Me to Church," features a performance by Ukrainian ballet dancer Sergei Polunin, a former principal dancer for the British Royal Ballet. The tattooed Polunin, 25, is shirtless and almost appears nude, thanks to his flesh-colored, skintight shorts. The video was directed by David LaChapelle, reports Time, which calls it "stunning." That's the word chosen by multiple outlets; the Huffington Post says the dancer "simply slays" the performance.

Original Story:  – Sarah Huckabee Sanders went out for dinner Friday night in Lexington, Virginia—for a couple of minutes, at least. A server briefly attended to Sanders and her family at the Red Hen until the owner recognized Sanders and had the lot thrown out, CBS News reports. "I just served Sarah huckabee sanders for a total of 2 minutes before my owner kicked her out along with 7 of her other family members," an apparent Red Hen waiter posted on Facebook. Sanders confirmed the incident, tweeting that "I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington, VA to leave because I work for @POTUS and I politely left. Her actions say far more about her than about me. I always do my best to treat people, including those I disagree with, respectfully and will continue to do so." Others took to Yelp and social media to praise or vilify the restaurant owner, who remains unidentified and hasn't spoken to the press, the Guardian reports. "Better not speak while you’re there because if the staff disagrees with you they will toss you out," writes Michael McNamara Sr on the Red Hen's Facebook page. "Why bother with the hassle? Plenty of real restaurants who serve everyone." On the Dem side, a post from Sapphire Cianfriglia: "I appreciate how you decided to take a moral standing against an administration that is essentially emulating Nazi Germany (locking up children, letting white supremacists march freely in the streets, etc)." Sanders' ejection comes only days after two Trump officials behind the "zero tolerance" immigration policy—Stephen Miller and Kirstjen Nielsen—were hounded out of Mexican restaurants.

Original Story:  – The craziness surrounding Nigella Lawson and ex-husband Charles Saatchi got even crazier yesterday, when a London court heard testimony that for more than 10 years, Lawson abused drugs including cocaine on a daily basis. The testimony came as part of a trial involving Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, who used to work for the couple and are accused of defrauding them of more than $488,000, the Guardian reports. The Grillos claim that Lawson let them "spend whatever they liked" as long as they didn't tell Saatchi about her drug habit. The allegations were first aired earlier this month, when one of the Grillos' lawyers lodged a "bad character application" to try and discredit Lawson as a witness for the prosecution. He says the celebrity chef "did not want [Saatchi] to know about her use, particularly of cocaine. Because the defendants were fully aware of her illicit drug use, she consented to their expenditure on the understanding there would be no disclosure to her husband of her drug usage." The two most amusing part of this sad tale: Saatchi's new nickname for his ex is "Highgella," the New York Daily News reports, and Nigella's "thank you gift" to "Team Nigella" supporters is a "Holiday Hotcake" recipe. The prosecutor calls the drug claims "totally scurrilous."
Original Summary:  Nigella Lawson's ex-husband Charles Saatchi has been referred to as "Highgella" by his ex-wife, according to the New York Daily News. In a trial involving former employees who are accused of defrauding the couple of over $488,000, testimony has emerged that Lawson abused drugs, including cocaine, on a daily basis for over 10 years. The allegations were first aired earlier this month, with Lawson's lawyer arguing that she did not want Saatchi to know about her drug habit for fear of him discovering it. The prosecutor has dismissed the drug claims as "totally scurrilous."

Original Story:  – The Democrats debate for the first time Tuesday night, with the festivities from Las Vegas starting at 8:30 Eastern on CNN. You can expect Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee on stage, with Joe Biden still a wild card. Some related developments: Biden's lectern: CNN isn't just figuratively holding a spot for the vice president if decides to join the debate—it has a sixth lectern set aside. Right now, however, most analysts don't expect Biden to participate, reports the Hill. The wild card: If one emerges, it's likely to be Webb, according to the Washington Post. The former Virginia senator has "idiosyncratic" views that don't fit the usual mold. He's to the left on some things (an early opponent of the Iraq war) and to the right on others (the Confederate flag issue is "complicated," he says). Sanders: His challenge will be to come off as a plausible candidate for the general election, not just a darling of progressives in the primary. "It's one thing to be a prophet in the wilderness," a political scientist tells USA Today. "It's another to be presidential. That's Sanders' challenge." Clinton: A new national poll has her in front at 46%, ahead of Sanders at 27% and Biden at 16%, reports CBS News. If Biden doesn't run, her lead over Sanders only widens. As a result, she's not expected to attack her opponents aggressively but to focus on laying out her own message.

Original Story:  – Rupert Murdoch on Twitter? It seems unlikely, and many, including Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff, insist the account that popped up yesterday is fake. But none other than Twitter's own executive chairman, Jack Dorsey, tweeted last night: "With his own voice, in his own way, @RupertMurdoch is now on Twitter." The first tweet was posted 19 hours ago, and the account already has nearly 20,000 followers. It also has the blue and white "Verified Account" checkmark next to Murdoch's name. What has he written about so far? The Steve Jobs biography ("interesting but unfair. Family must hate."), Ron Paul ("Huge appeal of libertarian message."), St. Barth's ("too many people."), Alexander Hamilton ("Best man never elected president."), The Descendants ("Star Geo Clooney deserves Oscar, maybe film too."), and family outings ("Great time in sea with young daughters, uboating."). But, the Guardian notes, not everyone is enjoying Murdoch's 140-character insights: In reference to the News Corp. phone hacking scandal, former deputy prime minister John Prescott tweeted, "Welcome to Twitter ... @rupertmurdoch. I've left you a Happy New Year message on my voicemail!"

Original Story:  – "I can't get into the mind of a psychopath." The line from Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo about Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock may reflect conventional wisdom, but the term "psychopath" may be getting used too loosely, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The newspaper interviews a psychology professor and other experts who say that Paddock doesn't seem to fit the criteria. For one thing, psychopaths are impulsive, and police have made clear that Paddock's attack Sunday night had been meticulously planned. Paddock also kept in touch with family members and had a girlfriend, traits at odds with the classic picture of a psychopath as a cold loner. In the story, one former FBI profiler suggests a simple if macabre motive: "Paddock may have fantasized becoming the greatest mass murderer ever." But that still doesn't explain what prompted Paddock to move from fantasy into reality. Another former FBI agent wonders if some childhood trauma, perhaps related to Paddock's father being a bank robber sought by the FBI, finally bubbled to surface. Meanwhile, Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, has told FBI investigators that he seemed to exhibit symptoms of mental health troubles, reports NBC News. "She said he would lie in bed, just moaning and screaming, 'Oh, my God,'" one agency official tells the network.

Original Story:  – President Trump's address to Congress Tuesday night continues to reverberate in part because of the mostly positive reviews. Here's a look at some of the coverage: Politico suggests the speech, and what it signifies about the president, could have a big effect on the 2018 congressional races. Would-be Republican candidates leery of aligning themselves with a more bombastic Trump could have a change of heart, and Democrats' hopes of big, easy gains might fade. Read it here. But, wait, what's all this about a suddenly "presidential" Trump, wonders Brian Beutler in a New Republic piece with a headline calling the media reaction to the speech "shameful." Another piece along these lines at CNN blasts the "ridiculous gushing." In an essay at Fox News, Newt Gingrich lauds the speech as the best of Trump's life, one that shows he "is a serious man focused on achieving serious results." Read the op-ed here. A New York Times analysis says the speech does not represent a substantive shift for Trump, but a lesser nod to political reality. "It is a recognition by the White House, from Mr. Trump on down, that what it had been doing was not quite working and that a softer sales tactic was needed to sell the same hard-edge populist agenda he campaigned on, people close to Mr. Trump said." Read the piece here. Another analysis by Greg Sargent at the Washington Post says the speech deserves to be taken seriously, though he finds support for both sides of the "new Trump" argument: "The substantive evidence plainly weighs in favor of the argument that Trump’s evolution is largely cosmetic—that Bannonism remains the driving force behind the Trump presidency. However, it’s at least possible we may be seeing the beginnings of a genuine search for a different rationale." He lays it out here. A post at Axios says the speech's relatively optimistic tone was the result of others weighing in besides Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, namely Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and Mike Pence. (Newsweek says Ivanka, in particular, "set the tone.") Usual Trump critic Van Jones of CNN praised the speech, saying that when Trump singled out the widow of a Navy SEAL, "He became president in that moment." Jones, however, then took all kinds of flak for the praise, notes the Huffington Post.
Original Summary:  President Trump's address to Congress on Tuesday has received mixed reviews, with some hailing it as a sign of a more "presidential" tone and others arguing that it is a superficial shift. The speech has been seen as a possible turning point for Trump's presidency, with some arguing that he is evolving into a more statesmanlike leader and others maintaining that his populist agenda remains unchanged. The New York Times notes that the speech did not represent a substantive shift for Trump, but rather a recognition that his previous approach was not working. Meanwhile, Van Jones, a usual Trump critic, praised the speech, saying that Trump became president in a moment when he acknowledged the widow of a Navy SEAL.

Meanwhile, in Georgia, a driver for Israel's embassy found a package attached to his car; police in Tbilisi discovered a grenade inside and defused it, the government says. Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to blame the attempts on Iran, which he called "the greatest exporter of terror in the world." Both Iran and Hezbollah have said they'd seek revenge following recent assassinations, and the Israeli prime minister revealed that a number of planned attacks on Israelis and Jews had been prevented in places like Azerbaijan and Thailand lately. Netanyahu noted that "in all these cases, the elements behind the attacks were Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah." He didn't specify any evidence tying Iran to today's incidents, the Washington Post notes.

Both Iran and Hezbollah have said they'd seek revenge following recent assassinations, and the Israeli prime minister revealed that a number of planned attacks on Israelis and Jews had been prevented in places like Azerbaijan and Thailand lately. Netanyahu noted that "in all these cases, the elements behind the attacks were Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah." He didn't specify any evidence tying Iran to today's incidents, the Washington Post notes. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves.

Original Story:  – American Sniper author Chris Kyle wasn't the only badass sharpshooter in the family. His widow, Taya Kyle, showed up NRA World Shooting Champion Bruce Piatt at a charity shootout in Pflugerville, Texas, over the weekend, hitting 100% of her shots on 29 targets using TrackingPoint precision-guided firearms. Piatt was apparently at a disadvantage using military-grade rifles carried by US troops in combat and hit just 59% of his shots amid explosions and simulated gunfire, per KHOU. Kyle tells Fox News her late husband spoke with the creators of TrackingPoint "about what goes into making a shot at such long distances with such precision" back in 2009. His insights helped shape the technology in TrackPoint's weapons that "does all the computations for you." Kyle, who describes herself as "absolutely a novice marksman," says she trained for a week with a former Marine who taught her proper breathing techniques and how to take offhand, kneeling, and sitting shots. In one particularly impressive move, Kyle poked her weapon and hands through a hole in a wall and shot blindly. However, she was wearing glasses that showed the view out the gun's scope. "I could see what the scope was seeing, line up the shot, find the target, and take that shot without exposing any more of my body or face," she says. After the event—which raised $1 million for the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation, per the Washington Times—Kyle said she was "passionate about getting the TrackingPoint guns into our warriors' hands … They are willing to give their lives for us; the least we can do is give them our very best in that fight."

Original Story:  – Arkansas cops destroyed Josh Duggar's police file last week, but an online copy is revealing details of his alleged sexual crimes. A judge ordered police to erase the records amid allegations that the reality TV star on 19 Kids and Counting had molested five underage girls as a teenager, the AP reports via USA Today. "The judge ordered us yesterday to expunge that record," a police rep said on Friday. "As far as the Springdale Police Department is concerned this report doesn't exist." But a redacted copy posted by In Touch says Duggar confessed to authorities and received no punishment—just a "very stern talk" from a state trooper, People reports. That was 16 months after Duggar first admitted "wrong-doing" to his father, Jim Bob, the reports say. Duggar also sought rehabilitation at the Institute in Basic Life Principles Training Center in Little Rock, Arkansas, before going to police, adds People. The Center purports to "strengthen individuals and families through sound Biblical teachings," its website says, but has been called a place "where these kids almost disappear" and was investigated by Child Protective Services. The Center's founder, 79-year-old Bill Gothard, resigned after accusations last year of sexual harassment and assault against 34 women. Duggar's alleged crimes were no secret either, torpedoing a Duggar family appearance on Oprah in 2006 and coming up on a message board a year later, Gawker reports. "Oprah was informed that Josh ... had been molesting his sisters," reads one comment. "Yes, this is the truth."

Original Story:  – Southern Comfort bills itself as "the spirit of New Orleans," but the generic grain-neutral spirit base it contains (an ingredient not far removed from vodka) doesn't exactly scream "Deep South character." The Sazerac Company, owner of the college-staple brand, wants to change that perception—and hopefully sales—by reintroducing whiskey into the mix in redesigned bottles set to hit shelves in July, the New York Times reports. Sazerac, which VinePair notes also owns the Buffalo Trace bourbon and Bowman Brothers whiskey brands, wants to dump the "liqueur" association it believes consumers often attribute to Southern Comfort, bringing it back to its original roots by adding undisclosed types of North American whiskey in its own stash. The Southern Comfort website explains the famous libation was first whipped up in 1874 by a bartender (identified by the Times as Martin W. Heron) who tried to tamp down the "harsh whiskeys of the time" by throwing in various fruits and spices. But the Times notes that by the time Brown-Forman took over the brand's barrels in 1979, the whiskey had been completely nixed from the mix—and once Sazerac bought Southern Comfort from Brown-Forman in 2016, the idea of adding whiskey back started gaining momentum. The company plans on phasing out flavored SoCo versions while retaining the 70-proof and 100-proof original recipes. It also wants to add in an 80-proof version with a black label on the bottle like those of competitors Jack Daniel's and Jim Beam. (The revamped SoCo will likely cost less than this Scotch whisky in a perfume-bottle-shaped decanter.)

The company wants to change consumer perception of the brand by reintroducing whiskey into the mix and phasing out flavored versions. The original recipe for Southern Comfort was created in 1874 by a bartender named Martin W. Heron, who tried to tamp down harsh whiskeys of the time with various fruits and spices. The brand was acquired by Brown-Forman in 1979, at which point the whiskey was completely removed from the mix. Sazerac plans to retain the 70-proof and 100-proof original recipes and add an 80-proof version with a black label, similar to competitors Jack Daniels and Jim Beam.

Original Story:  – A California school district is scrapping a lesson plan that allowed middle school students to deny the existence of the Holocaust, Fox News reports. After a wave of criticism and a reported death threat, Southern California's Rialto Unified School District backpedaled on its unusual method of teaching eighth-graders about propaganda. The lesson plan (part of a "Diary of Anne Frank" unit, the Daily Bulletin notes) asked students to write an essay for or against the belief that the Holocaust occurred—which would help them "develop critical thinking skills," a school board member said. Among the critics was the Anti-Defamation League, which expressed its concerns to district Interim Superintendent Mohammad Islam, saying the lesson plan "gives legitimacy to the hateful and anti-Semitic promoters of Holocaust denial," reports another Daily Bulletin article. Today the district canceled the plan and promised to strike "any reference to the Holocaust 'not occurring'" from school assignments. Meanwhile, Rialto police said they received several calls from someone who made death threats against Islam and a district spokeswoman. Authorities are investigating, and two officers were stationed today on campus.

Original Story:  – The vast majority of humanity is breathing dirty air, putting us at risk of heart disease, stroke, and lung disease, the World Health Organization says. The agency's most detailed analysis yet of air pollution reveals that 92% of the world's population is breathing air that fails to meet basic health standards, NPR reports. About 6.5 million deaths per year are linked to air pollution, 3 million of them exclusively to outdoor exposure, which was the focus of the study. In 2012, one of every nine deaths was linked to bad air, with devastating consequences. "Air pollution continues to take a toll on the health of the most vulnerable populations—women, children and the older adults," said Flavia Bustreo, WHO's assistant director general, in a news release. "For people to be healthy, they must breathe clean air from their first breath to their last." China was by far the worst off, with more than 1 million deaths in 2012, followed by India with 621,000. (The US had 38,000, Australia only 94.) Sources include dirty cars and buses, household fuel, waste burning, and power plants. The WHO used air-pollution data from nearly 3,000 spots obtained from satellites and ground stations to measure airborne particulate matter such as sulphates and nitrates. But because the samples did not include known pollutants such as ozone, actual air quality could be far worse. Just last month, US researchers said that cracking down just a bit on ozone and particulate matter standards could save 9,000 lives a year, NBC News reports. The WHO's Maria Neria said the mortality breakdown by country ought to spur a global crackdown on air pollution. "What we are learning is, this is very bad. Now there are no excuses for not taking action," she told the Guardian. (One study said air pollution could be linked to Alzheimer's disease.)

Original Story:  – Pero Jelinic's love of big game hunting took him all over the world, but most recently to South Africa, where he hoped to bring down a lion. It was to be the "crown" of the Croatian's trophy hall, filled with "everything that could be hunted in Croatia and Europe," his friend, Slavko Pernar, told reporters, per Yahoo. But though Jelinic apparently managed to nab that crown, it was only shortly before Pernar says he met "the ugliest end." The details are murky, but police say 75-year-old Jelinic was fatally shot Saturday while hunting with two friends at Leeuwbosch Game Lodge, where lions are bred in captivity some 40 miles from the Botswana border. The group had killed one lion and was tracking a second when Jelinic was hit by a bullet and died after being airlifted to a hospital, reports the BBC. Police aren't sure who fired the fatal shot and while they don't suspect foul play, they've opened a culpable homicide (manslaughter) investigation and are considering charges of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition, reports the Week. One of the men present maintains the guns were legal, however, and describes the shooting as an accident that came after "a series of unfortunate circumstances," per the Mirror. According to one account, a tired Jelinic handed his guns to other hunters in his party before he was accidentally shot in the shoulder, per Total Croatia News. A separate account suggests Jelinic was shot while aiming at a lion. Either way, Pernar says Jelinic—a hotel owner who leased the building to fund his retirement and hunting trips—died "doing what he loved."

Original Story:  – Would-be Reagan assassin John Hinckley Jr. will not be charged with murder in last year's death of James Brady, the Washington Post reports. The notion had become a real possibility when a coroner ruled that Brady's death at age 73 was a homicide—the result of the bullets that struck him in the head back in 1981. Federal prosecutors decided they would have little chance of conviction considering that Hinckley was found to be not guilty by reason of insanity of all charges at the time, reports NBC News. "The decision was made following a review of applicable law, the history of the case, and the circumstances of Mr. Brady's death, including recently finalized autopsy findings," says a statement from the US Attorney's Office in Washington. The Brady family issued a statement saying it respected the decision. Hinckley remains institutionalized at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington, though he gets to spend a lot of time on the outside.

Original Story:  – Almost one in three resident doctors may suffer from depression and their patients may suffer as a result, according to a new study led by a Harvard resident. Douglas Mata and his team, which included an expert on physician mental health, examined 17,560 doctors in the early stages of their career using data from 54 studies conducted over the past five decades. They found that almost 5,000 residents, or 29%, showed signs of depression, per AFP; individual studies put the rate at between 20% and 43%, according to a release. Not all of these residents would qualify for diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, but "you can have significant symptoms that are just as debilitating even if you don't meet all the criteria," a researcher tells the Washington Post. An editorial accompanying the study notes "these findings could be easily construed as describing a depression endemic." Why are residents depressed? The authors note doctors must complete grueling training during internship and residency periods after medical school. They face long hours, high stress and responsibility, get little sleep, and spend "40% to 50% of their time" doing secretarial work, Mata says. "It's not rewarding." Overall, researchers say depression rates have increased over the past 50 years, which is "surprising and important, especially in light of reforms that have been implemented over the years with the intent of improving the mental health of residents." This could be due to shorter patient turnaround periods and advertising that prompts patients to ask for drugs they don't need. Because previous studies have shown depressed doctors may be more likely to make mistakes, researchers hope to find new "strategies to prevent and treat depression." (This woman argues being a doctor is "humiliating.")
Original Summary:  According to a new study, nearly one-third of resident doctors may be suffering from depression. The study analyzed data from 54 studies conducted over the past five decades and found that 29% of residents showed signs of depression. The authors suggest that the grueling training and high stress of residency may contribute to the high rates of depression among doctors. The study also notes that depression rates have increased over the past 50 years, which could be due to factors such as shorter patient turnaround periods and increased advertising of drugs. Researchers hope to find new strategies to prevent and treat depression among doctors to improve patient care.

Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. Douglas Mata and his team, which included an expert on physician mental health, examined 17,560 doctors in the early stages of their career using data from 54 studies conducted over the past five decades. They found that almost 5,000 residents, or 29%, showed signs of depression, per AFP; individual studies put the rate at between 20% and 43%, according to a release. Not all of these residents would qualify for diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, but "you can have significant symptoms that are just as debilitating even if you don't meet all the criteria," a researcher tells the Washington Post. An editorial accompanying the study notes "these findings could be easily construed as describing a depression endemic." Why are residents depressed? The authors note doctors must complete grueling training during internship and residency periods after medical school. They face long hours, high stress and responsibility, get little sleep, and spend "40% to 50% of their time" doing secretarial work, Mata says. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. "It's not rewarding." Overall, researchers say depression rates have increased over the past 50 years, which is "surprising and important, especially in light of reforms that have been implemented over the years with the intent of improving the mental health of residents." This could be due to shorter patient turnaround periods and advertising that prompts patients to ask for drugs they don't need. Caterpillars feed only on milkweed, making them toxic to predators. Because previous studies have shown depressed doctors may be more likely to make mistakes, researchers hope to find new "strategies to prevent and treat depression." (This woman argues being a doctor is "humiliating.")
Injected Summary:  According to a new study, nearly one-third of resident doctors may be suffering from depression, which can impact their ability to provide quality care to their patients. The study, led by a Harvard resident, examined over 17,000 doctors and found that 29% showed signs of depression. The authors suggest that the grueling training and long hours during internship and residency may contribute to the high rates of depression among doctors. Previous studies have shown that depressed doctors may be more likely to make mistakes, highlighting the importance of addressing this issue. The study's findings suggest that reforms aimed at improving the mental health of residents may be necessary to ensure the well-being of both doctors and their patients.

Original Story:  – The names of Guantanamo's dozens of "indefinite detainees" deemed too dangerous to release even if the detention center is closed have been disclosed for the first time. In response to a lawsuit from the Miami Herald, the federal government released a list of prisoners including 26 Yemenis, 12 Afghans, three Saudis, two Kuwaitis, two Libyans, a Kenyan, a Moroccan, and a Somali it says cannot be tried in court but cannot be transferred or released. Two of the Afghans have died—one from suicide and one from a heart attack—since a task force produced the list in 2010, so there are now 46 indefinite detainees among Guantanamo's 166 inmates. The men, many of whom are among the more than 100 Guantanamo hunger strikers, are being held under the Authorized Use of Military Force signed by George W. Bush in 2001. Officials have given a variety of reasons why they cannot stand trial, including tainted evidence, the AP reports. An Amnesty International spokesman says the notion of keeping captives as "indefinite detainees" is "fundamentally flawed." Under international human rights law, "all of the detainees should either be charged and fairly tried in federal court, or released," he says.

Original Story:  – Don't blame the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq just yet for the growing number of military suicides. That's the conclusion of a new study published in JAMA Psychiatry that finds the suicide rate of troops deployed there was only a bit higher than that of troops who've served either in the US or elsewhere: 18.86 deaths per 100,000 for the former, 17.78 per 100,000 for the latter, the New York Times reports. But something's behind the increasing suicide rate in the military—the Times notes it's nearly doubled since 2005—and researchers say more research is needed. "As the wars went on, the suicide rates also went up and it was very tempting to assume deployments must be the reason," says lead author Mark Reger. "Our data don't support that." The study, said to be the largest of its kind, looked at the paperwork for 3.9 million troops who served from 2001 to 2007; among those service members, there were 5,041 suicides by the end of 2009, Reuters reports. What the study did find: The suicide rate for Army and Marine crews—which the Times notes took on most of the Iraq and Afghanistan fighting—was about 25% higher than that of the other branches, though the suicide rate in those two branches didn't differ much between those deployed and those who weren't. Another find: that troops who left before serving four years had almost double the suicide rate of those who stuck around; it was three times as high for service members who received a disciplinary involuntary discharge. The study could affect future suicide-prevention programs and the services veterans receive, the Military Times notes.
Original Summary:  According to a new study published in JAMA Psychiatry, the suicide rate among military personnel deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq is not significantly higher than that of troops who have served in other locations. The study analyzed data from 3.9 million service members who served from 2001 to 2007 and found that the suicide rate among Army and Marine crews was about 25% higher than that of other branches. The study also found that troops who left before serving four years had almost double the suicide rate of those who stayed, and those who received a disciplinary involuntary discharge had a threefold higher suicide rate. The study suggests that more research is needed to understand the reasons behind the increasing suicide rate in the military. The findings could impact future suicide-prevention programs and the services provided to veterans.

Original Story:  – When Iris Grace Halmshaw's parents first supplied their daughter with painting supplies, they hoped it would be a fun way for the autistic girl to express herself. But instead of stick figures, Iris Grace immersed herself in abstract impressionist painting for hours at a time, often depicting movement in nature such as water, trees, wind, birds, and of course her cat, Thula. Now 5, Iris Grace is already selling her paintings for thousands of dollars a print, with art collectors and galleries gushing over the vibrancy and openness of her work, reports the Independent. "She is so interested in movement and how it changes things," her mother tells the paper, noting her daughter has received "a lot of references to Monet because of the Impressionistic style." It all started simply enough, with her parents opting to share their daughter's early works online. Now Iris Grace has more than 95,000 likes on Facebook, and the proceeds from her art help fund her art supplies and private therapy for her disorder, which made it difficult for her to speak until recently. Meanwhile, her mother tells ABC News they have to shield their daughter from all the attention and keep her schedule as stable and routine as possible. "Nothing has changed in Iris' world," notes her mom. (One biochemist claims to have cured her daughter of autism by removing this from her diet.)

Original Story:  – After more than two months, a man has been charged in a killing that shook the University of Wisconsin-Stout community. Cullen Osborn, a 27-year-old from Minneapolis, has been charged with felony murder and battery in the beating death of Saudi student Hussain Saeed Alnahdi, the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram reports. The 24-year-old Alnahdi died Oct. 31, the day after police found him unconscious and bleeding outside a pizza restaurant in Menomonie around 2am. Witnesses said he had been beaten during an altercation with a tall white man. The death led to increased police patrols amid fears it could have been a hate crime. Police, however, said during the investigation that they do not believe this was a hate crime, and a criminal complaint unveiled late Thursday states that Osburn insisted the incident had nothing to do with anybody's race, NBC reports. Witnesses gave police varying accounts of the confrontation between the men, though more than one said that Osborn was behaving aggressively and appeared to have started an argument with Alnahdi. "I hope this arrest brings some measure of peace and comfort to Hussain's family in Saudi Arabia," UW-Stout Chancellor Bob Meyer said in a statement Friday. After Alnahdi's death, the community offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to his assailant.

Original Story:  – Archaeology enthusiast Dmitriy Dey was watching a television program on pyramids when he decided such things should exist in his native Kazakhstan, as well. The New York Times reports he hopped onto Google Earth to look around a little and stumbled across what could prove to be the oldest earthworks ever discovered. Two weeks ago—eight years after Dey made his discovery—NASA released the first satellite images of the 260 or so mounds, banks, and trenches that populate a remote area of the country. According to Quartz, the largest of these man-made geometric figures is called the Ushtogaysky Square. It's 810,000 square feet with each side measuring as long as an aircraft carrier. “I’ve never seen anything like this," one NASA scientist tells the Times. "I found it remarkable." Kazakhstan has shown little interest in studying what are now called the Steppe Geoglyphs since Dey discovered them in 2007, the Times reports. In fact, so little had been published about the discovery that a professor looking into them thought they must be a hoax, according to the Telegraph. That's starting to change. The Times reports initial research into the earthworks reveals the oldest to be about 8,000 years old. If that's true, it would be the oldest ever found. Dey believes they could have been built by Stone Age tribes living in the region, which would challenge scientific assumptions on early nomadic peoples. Tribes would have to have been larger, better organized, and more stationary than previously thought. Dey is now hoping to set up a base from which to study the geoglyphs, and NASA has requested photos of the area from astronauts. (One geoglyph found in Kazakhstan is in the shape of a swastika.)

Original Story:  – Introducing Metaspriggina, a minnow-sized fish that lived about 500 million years ago and appears to occupy a crucial branch of your family tree. Scientists say the creature might just be the ancestor of nearly all vertebrates, reports LiveScience. The revelation comes after study of dozens of remarkably well-preserved Metaspriggina fossils found in the Canadian Rockies. Researchers discovered that the fish had a pair of gill arches near the front of its body that are the "primitive precursors of the jaw," reports the Toronto Star. It's the first time such a feature has been seen in the fossil record, reports PhysOrg. “It was a major event in the evolution of vertebrates," says the co-author of a new report in Nature. "After the creation of jaws, vertebrates were able to capture prey and (chew) food." Metaspriggina also had something called a notochord, essentially cartilage that ran the length of its body. The New York Times notes that "human embryos develop a notochord, too, but it later turns into the disks of cartilage between the vertebrae in our spine." A British Columbia expert not involved with the work says the fish is "clearly a benchmark early vertebrate, which we haven't seen before."

Original Story:  – The ancient Greek city of Bargylia in modern-day Turkey is on the market and could be yours for just $8 million, reports MNN. Located 19 miles from Bodrum on 300 acres overlooking the Gulf of Güllük, the property includes a theatre, fortification walls, acropolis, and necropolis, according to the Greek City Times. The property dates back to the first century BC and was founded in honor of the mythical Bargylos, who was mortally wounded by the winged horse Pegasus. Bargylia has never been officially excavated so no one is certain what artifacts might be lurking there, but treasure hunters can be heard looting the property at night. The area has been privately owned since 1927 and is currently classified as a Grade 1 archaeological site, so it’s off-limits for development, but that classification could be changed. Turkey is hoping that selling the property to a responsible owner will help protect it from theft and decay. Locals hope that Greece’s Culture and Tourism Ministry will step in and rescue the parcel. The site was up for sale in 2015, and at the time it was described as "a first-degree archeological site, facing the Bird Heaven Lake near the Bogazici Village, with full sea and lake view," according to the Lonely Planet. The price has been reduced by $2 million, so you could say that it's dirt cheap.

Located 19 miles from Bodrum on 300 acres overlooking the Gulf of Güllük, the property includes a theatre, fortification walls, acropolis, and necropolis, according to the Greek City Times. The property dates back to the first century BC and was founded in honor of the mythical Bargylos, who was mortally wounded by the winged horse Pegasus. Bargylia has never been officially excavated so no one is certain what artifacts might be lurking there, but treasure hunters can be heard looting the property at night. The area has been privately owned since 1927 and is currently classified as a Grade 1 archaeological site, so it’s off-limits for development, but that classification could be changed. Monarch butterflies lay their eggs on milkweed leaves. Turkey is hoping that selling the property to a responsible owner will help protect it from theft and decay. The eggs hatch into larvae, known as caterpillars. Locals hope that Greece’s Culture and Tourism Ministry will step in and rescue the parcel. The site was up for sale in 2015, and at the time it was described as "a first-degree archeological site, facing the Bird Heaven Lake near the Bogazici Village, with full sea and lake view," according to the Lonely Planet. The price has been reduced by $2 million, so you could say that it's dirt cheap.

The property includes a theatre, fortification walls, acropolis, and necropolis and dates back to the first century BC.

Original Story:  – The fact that a soccer fan named his daughter after his favorite team is maybe not so exceptional. The fact that he managed to hide the inspiration from his wife for two years is. Clare Smith of New South Wales, Australia, wrote to a magazine to confess that she thought she and her hubby chose their daughter's name, Lanesra, because it was "unique and romantic," per the Telegraph. Only much later did her husband confess that the name was actually soccer team Arsenal, of the English Premier League, spelled backward. Reddit users are somewhat divided on the name, with one claiming it sounds like a "topical ointment." (At least it's not an Instagram filter.)
Original Summary:  A man named his daughter after his favorite soccer team, Arsenal, without telling his wife for two years. The man, from New South Wales, Australia, spelled the team's name backwards to come up with the name Lanesra for his daughter. When his wife found out, she was surprised and amused by the unique and unexpected name choice. Some Reddit users have mixed opinions on the name, with one comparing it to a "topical ointment." Despite the unusual origin, the family has embraced the name and finds it special and meaningful.

Original Story:  – Police have rescued three women from a London house where they were allegedly held captive and may have been treated as slaves for 30 years or more, NBC News reports. Authorities were first contacted about the situation last month, by a domestic abuse nonprofit. The women—a 69-year-old Malaysian woman, 57-year-old Irish woman, and 30-year-old British woman—are "highly traumatized" but are now in "a place of safety," reads a police statement. Two 67-year-olds, a man and a woman, were arrested "as part of an investigation into slavery and domestic servitude," it continues. "We applaud the actions of Freedom Charity and are working in partnership to support these victims who appear to have been held for over 30 years," says a police spokesman. The Irish woman apparently contacted Freedom Charity after seeing a television documentary on forced marriages related to the nonprofit's mission, the Irish Independent reports.

Original Story:  – A grieving family is accusing Chicago cops of attempting to cover up the murder of their 18-year-old son after the police department released nine videos Friday showing the final moments of Paul O'Neal's life, the Los Angeles Times reports. O'Neal was driving what police say was a stolen car when officers opened fire on the car in the middle of a neighborhood on July 28. O'Neal got out of the car and ran; an officer chased after him and shot him in the back when he didn't stop. According to WLS, the body camera of the officer who shot O'Neal wasn't functioning. It's unclear why. But the cameras of other officers arriving on the scene were rolling. One officer called O'Neal a "bitch-ass motherfucker" as he was bleeding on the ground, Vox reports. Another yelled "Why did you have to shoot at us?" O'Neal didn't have a gun and hadn't shot at officers. None of the officers attempted to give aid to O'Neal. The videos also show officers talking about how the media will react and what will happen to them. "I'm going to be fucking crucified," says one. Chicago's head of police oversight calls the videos "shocking and disturbing." Three officers have already had their police powers removed, and O'Neal's family is suing. "These police officers decided to play judge, jury, and executioner," the family's lawyer tells the Times.

Original Story:  – President Trump's choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with a favorable recommendation, narrowly avoiding a rare rebuke as his confirmation heads to the full Senate. Democrats put up stiff resistance and voted against Pompeo, who's currently the CIA director. Only a last-minute switch from Kentucky Republican Rand Paul—whom Trump called before the vote—enabled Pompeo to win committee approval, the AP reports. It would have been the first time since the committee starting keeping records in 1925 that a secretary of state nominee faced an unfavorable report. Pompeo's nomination now goes to the full Senate, where votes are tallying in his favor. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he looks forward to voting to confirm Pompeo this week. Paul announced his change in position after talking with Trump moments before the committee was set to consider the nominee. He tweeted that after talking with Trump and meeting with the nominee he received assurances that Pompeo believes the Iraq war "was a mistake, that regime change has destabilized the region, and that we must end our involvement with Afghanistan." With those assurances, the senator said he had "decided to support his nomination to be our next secretary of state."

Original Story:  – More than 35 years later, Alan Dershowitz is trying to bring the case against Roman Polanski, who fled the US before being sentenced on a statutory rape charge in 1978, to an end. The lawyer has filed new paperwork in a California court calling for a hearing that could close the case for good. His two reasons for justifying a hearing: He accuses prosecutors of providing false information when they recently attempted to have the director extradited from Poland (the extradition request called Polanski a "continuing flight risk" even though he had appeared for questioning in Poland voluntarily, among other things), and he says that new testimony reveals a Superior Court judge in 2009 "unethically prejudged issues" surrounding the Polanski prosecution that had not yet been argued in court, the New York Times reports. That judge oversaw the legal fight that started in 2008 after documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired was released, and the new testimony comes from a former public information officer of the court, who says the judge was willing to ultimately limit Polanski's sentence to time served should he actually return to the US, but that he planned to let him "cool his heels in jail" first by delaying his ruling for weeks. Polanski's lawyers are arguing that, as the now-81-year-old director spent 42 days in prison for psychiatric evaluation under a plea deal back when the case started, and only fled when he discovered the judge planned to give him more jail time despite an off-the-record agreement not to do so, he has actually already served his sentence in full. In the new filing, his legal team also says the recent extradition request failed to mention that he had already served the court-ordered prison time, the Los Angeles Times reports.

Original Story:  – The US and UK blanketed Germany with at least 1.3 million tons of bombs during World War II, and as much as 10% of that never exploded, with the Smithsonian reporting in 2016 that more than 2,000 tons of unexploded munitions are found in the country annually. That would make the discovery of an unexploded bomb in Frankfurt relatively unsurprising—if not for its sheer size. The 2-ton bomb is an HC 4000 and has the ability to impact buildings more than half a mile away, hence its nickname, per the Local: "Wohnblockknacker," or "blockbuster." Its discovery has spurred what Deutsche Welle reports is the biggest evacuation since the end of WWII: Some 70,000 people, or roughly 10% of the city's population, will need to leave their Frankfurt homes on Sunday. "Due to the large size of the bomb, extensive evacuation measures must be taken," the Local quotes police as saying. The bomb was uncovered Tuesday during construction work on Wismarer Strasse, which is near the city center, reports the AFP; the German Federal Bank and two hospitals fall within the evacuation area. The previous largest evacuation occurred last Christmas Day in Augsburg, when more than 54,000 had to evacuate. The Smithsonian describes German bomb-disposal squads as "among the busiest in the world," and notes it can be a deadly occupation: 11 bomb technicians lost their lives between 2000 and 2016. (This prison was evacuated this summer after a 500-pound bomb was found.)

Original Story:  – Two heroes have emerged in Minnesota: an abducted 15-year-old girl and the 65-year-old farmer who found her. Fox News and the Twin Cities Pioneer Press report Jasmine Block disappeared from her Alexandria home on Aug. 8, and she was reportedly held for nearly a month in an abandoned house, where she says she was physically and sexually assaulted. On Sept. 5, however, she broke out, swam across a lake, and started running when she got to the other side. It was then that Jasmine ran into Earl Melchert, who said he saw a "speck" rushing toward him in his truck; he tells the New York Times he thought it was a deer at first. As she got closer, he realized it wasn't a deer, but a missing girl he recognized from newscasts and posters around town. He got Jasmine into his truck, called 911, and started driving the teen to the local police station. As they drove, Jasmine saw a car driven by one of the suspects, which helped cops catch them the same day. But it was Melchert's next "incredible act of kindness," as the Alexandria Police Department notes on Facebook, that brought on even more hugs: He turned down the $7,000 reward and gave it to Jasmine instead. "He believes that young lady that came running towards him that September day is the real hero," the Alexandria PD notes, adding, "Thank you Earl, it is people like you that make this world a better place." Melchert tells the Press he was simply "in the right place at the right time." Jasmine is back in school and healing with the help of a therapy dog, while the three suspects—Thomas Barker, 32, a family acquaintance, as well as Joshua Holby, 31, and Steven Powers, 20—have been charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment, assault, and criminal sexual conduct.

He got Jasmine into his truck, called 911, and started driving the teen to the local police station. As they drove, Jasmine saw a car driven by one of the suspects, which helped cops catch them the same day. But it was Melchert's next "incredible act of kindness," as the Alexandria Police Department notes on Facebook, that brought on even more hugs: He turned down the $7,000 reward and gave it to Jasmine instead. "He believes that young lady that came running towards him that September day is the real hero," the Alexandria PD notes, adding, "Thank you Earl, it is people like you that make this world a better place." Melchert tells the Press he was simply "in the right place at the right time." Jasmine is back in school and healing with the help of a therapy dog, while the three suspects—Thomas Barker, 32, a family acquaintance, as well as Joshua Holby, 31, and Steven Powers, 20—have been charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment, assault, and criminal sexual conduct.
Injected Summary:  A 15-year-old girl named Jasmine Block was abducted in Minnesota and held captive for nearly a month. She managed to escape and was found by a 65-year-old farmer named Earl Melchert, who recognized her from news reports. Melchert drove Jasmine to the police station and turned down a $7,000 reward for his actions. The three suspects, Thomas Barker, Joshua Holby, and Steven Powers, have been charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment, assault, and criminal sexual conduct. Jasmine is now back in school and receiving therapy with the help of a therapy dog.

Original Story:  – People tortured in the custody of Chicago police are going to be eligible for payouts of up to $100,000 as the city tries to move on from a shameful chapter in its history. In what the Guardian calls "the first gesture of its kind in America," the city council has approved a $5.5 million reparations fund for people—most of them black men—tortured by former Cmdr. Jon Burge and his men between 1972 and 1991. Burge and a team of detectives dubbed the "Midnight Crew" used methods including electric shocks, suffocation, and Russian roulette to extract confessions from scores of suspects, NPR reports. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the historic move "another step, but an essential step, in righting a wrong—removing a stain," reports the Chicago Tribune. The city—which has already spent around $100 million settling Burge-related lawsuits—has also agreed to provide counseling, education, and job training for torture victims and their immediate relatives and will ensure that the case is taught in public schools, USA Today reports. Burge, who was fired in 1993, was not charged with any torture-related crimes before the statute of limitations expired, the Guardian notes. Last year, he finished a four-year sentence for a perjury charge stemming from a civil lawsuit and still receives a police pension.

Original Story:  – At its face, the line sounds explosive: CBS News reports actor Robert Wagner "is now a person of interest" in wife Natalie Wood's 1981 drowning death, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's investigators. But read on in CBS' report, and what Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Lieutenant John Corina is quoted as telling 48 Hours is a slightly softer version of that: "As we've investigated the case over the last six years, I think he's more of a person of interest now." And as a rep for Wagner tells Time, 48 Hours has lobbed such accusations against Wagner before. But with Natalie Wood: Death in Dark Water set to air on Saturday on CBS, the mysterious death is getting yet another look. The investigation into Wood's death was reopened in late 2011, and CBS News reports Wagner hasn't spoken to investigators since that occurred. He, Captain Dennis Davern, and the actor Christopher Walken were on the boat Wood went missing from off the Catalina coast. She was found in the water the next day, and the death was ruled accidental; in 2012, it was reclassified as "undetermined." Corina seems to cast suspicion on Wagner with his comments, saying "he's constantly changed his story a little bit." When asked by 48 Hours whether he thinks Wagner knows more about what really happened, Corina offers this: "Well, I think he does because he's the last one to see her." (A coroner in 2013 said Wood's body was bruised before she drowned.)
Original Summary:  Robert Wagner is now considered a "person of interest" in the 1981 death of his wife, Natalie Wood, according to Los Angeles County Sheriffs investigators. However, the investigation has been ongoing for six years, and Wagner has not spoken to investigators since it was reopened in 2011. Wood went missing from a boat off the Catalina coast, and her body was found in the water the next day, with the initial ruling of accidental death later changed to "undetermined." The investigator, Lieutenant John Corina, has expressed suspicion towards Wagner, citing inconsistencies in his story and the fact that he was the last person to see Wood alive. Corina also suggests that Wagner may know more about what happened than he has revealed.

Original Story:  – The remains of a Bronze Age cultic priestess found in Egtved, Denmark, in 1921 belong to a teenager who'd likely traveled all the way from southern Germany—a great distance for the year 1370BC, researchers report in a press release. They now know this is because her oak coffin was buried in a peat bog burial mound that let water in but not out, so while her bones had long since decayed, her clothing, hair, and nails were well preserved, the team notes in the journal Scientific Reports. This enabled them to analyze strontium isotopes, where differences in the number of neutrons in atoms of that element reveal the region where she spent time. The analysis suggests that her woolen skirt came from somewhere near southwestern Germany's Black Forest. What they also employed to re-create her movements: her hair, which was 9 inches at its longest point (it grew about 0.4 inches a month, so the hair housed roughly two years of information), as well as a molar tooth, which holds geographical secrets of the first few years of her life. Their analysis suggested she'd gone on several long trips during her last two years, probably spent much of her last six months far from Denmark, and likely died shortly after getting to Egtved. Researcher Karin Margarita Frei tells LiveScience, "She looks, in a way, very modern, in this kind of miniskirt and a kind of T-shirt." (It's a look some have re-created. Seriously.) In fact, her remains suggest she was a cultic priestess who may have been married to a Danish chieftan. What's particularly notable about the findings: The researchers say it's the first time a prehistoric person's movements have been charted with such accuracy. (Closer to home, archaeologists have resurrected a key Pocahontas site.)

Original Story:  – Poor Stephen Thompson. Of all the things the Oregon State freshman basketball player didn't expect to see while attempting two free-throws Thursday night, an 18-time gold-medal Olympian with the wingspan of a Boeing 747 wearing nothing but a Speedo had to top the list. Today reports that Michael Phelps was a surprise guest at Arizona State's men's basketball game against OSU, participating in the traditional "Curtain of Distraction." When opposing teams are shooting foul shots, the ASU student section sets up a curtain, then pulls it back to reveal sometime completely bizarre and utterly distracting. This time it was Phelps. (You can watch it here.) When the curtain was pulled back during Thompson's first foul shot, Phelps—who has been training for the 2016 Olympics nearby—ripped off his shirt to reveal a handful of gold medals. For the second shot, Phelps got all the way down to a Speedo, swim cap, and bow tie. Thompson missed both shots, and ASU eventually ended up winning 86-68. "You could see the look on [Thompson's] face," ASU's associate athletic director tells Yahoo. "He couldn't help but look. He was trying to hold himself together, but you could tell by the look in his eyes he was going to miss the first one. Missing the second one was just icing on the cake."

Original Story:  – Jimmy Kimmel held his baby son as he returned to his late-night show after a week off for the boy's heart surgery. Kimmel was crying from the first moment of his monologue Monday night as he pleaded with Congress to restore and improve children's health coverage, a cause he has championed since his son Billy was born with a heart defect in April, the AP reports. "I was out last week—because this guy had heart surgery. But look he's fine everybody, he may have pooped but he's fine," Kimmel said, per ABC. "Daddy cries on TV but Billy doesn't. It’s unbelievable." Billy needed one surgery just after his birth and had a follow-up operation last week. Kimmel kept up his ardent advocacy Monday night, urging Congress to restore the Children's Health Insurance Program, which has been left unfunded and stuck in a political stalemate since September. He slammed lawmakers for using the program, which covers around 9 million children, some of them with life-threatening conditions, as a "bargaining chip." "I don't know what could be more disgusting than putting a tax cut that mostly goes to the rich ahead of the lives of children," he said. "This is literally a life and death program for American kids."

Original Story:  – A victory for Samsung in its long-running feud with Apple: A judge has refused to ban 26 of the South Korean firm's smartphones, as Apple wanted. A jury this summer found that Samsung had knowingly infringed on Apple's patents, but that's not sufficient grounds for a ban, Judge Lucy Koh says. Instead, Apple would have to prove "irreparable harm" by demonstrating that customers were choosing specific Samsung devices over the Cupertino company's own, Forbes reports. Koh also noted that just "a small fraction" of Apple's features suffered infringement, and "it does not follow that entire products must be forever banned from the market," Reuters reports. Apple is likely to appeal the move, Forbes notes. In better news for the US firm, Koh nixed Samsung's call for a new trial over jury bias—leaving the $1.05 billion ruling in place, Mashable notes. Meanwhile, Samsung is ditching its bids for injunctions against Apple in Europe, where the European Commission in January planned an antitrust probe over Samsung patents. "We strongly believe it is better when companies compete fairly in the marketplace, rather than in court," the company said in a statement to the Verge.

The judge found that Apple had not provided sufficient grounds for a ban, as Samsung had not infringed on enough of Apple's patents to warrant a complete ban. Apple had argued that Samsung's infringement of its patents was so significant that it should be banned from the market, but the judge disagreed. The judge also noted that Samsung's infringement was limited to a small fraction of Apple's features, and that a complete ban was not necessary. Samsung is likely to appeal the decision, but in the meantime, the company is ditching its bids for injunctions against Apple in Europe.

Original Story:  – Albert Woodfox's time behind bars is not over. An order barring his release was extended today by a federal appeals court, NBC News reports. The timeline: A federal judge this week ordered Woodfox's "immediate" and "unconditional" release and barred the state from trying him a third time in the 1972 death of prison guard Brent Miller. But the state appealed, and a three-judge panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked his release. That panel today extended the order until the state's appeal plays out. The judges ordered an expedited appeals process, with final legal briefs in the case due Aug. 7. Woodfox was placed in solitary in 1972 after the death of Miller, whose body was found in an empty prison dormitory; he has spent four decades there. State officials have objected to the term "solitary confinement": They say Woodfox is allowed to watch TV through the bars of his cell, talk to other inmates in his tier, read books, talk to visiting chaplains, and leave his cell every day for an hour. How polarizing the back-and-forth surrounding Woodfox's possible release has been: Miller's widow, Teenie Roger, is convinced Woodfox is innocent. "I wish the state of Louisiana would stop spending all this money paying lawyers to keep Albert in prison for even longer than the 43 years he has already been there," she said in a statement this week, per the Advocate. But Wanda Callender, Miller's sister, told the Advocate in a phone call this morning that Rogers had been married to her brother for just two months before he died ("she is not part of our family and never has been") and that Woodfox "has a debt to pay to society, as well as our family."
Original Summary:  Albert Woodfox's release from prison has been temporarily blocked by a federal appeals court after the state of Louisiana appealed a judge's order for his immediate release. Woodfox has spent 43 years in solitary confinement, with the state arguing that he is allowed to leave his cell for an hour a day and engage in other activities. The case has been highly polarizing, with Woodfox's supporters believing he is innocent and the state continuing to pursue his prosecution. An expedited appeals process is underway, with final legal briefs due on August 7. Woodfox was originally convicted of the murder of prison guard Brent Miller in 1972, but his conviction was overturned in 2014 due to prosecutorial misconduct.

How polarizing the back-and-forth surrounding Woodfox's possible release has been: Miller's widow, Teenie Roger, is convinced Woodfox is innocent. "I wish the state of Louisiana would stop spending all this money paying lawyers to keep Albert in prison for even longer than the 43 years he has already been there," she said in a statement this week, per the Advocate. But Wanda Callender, Miller's sister, told the Advocate in a phone call this morning that Rogers had been married to her brother for just two months before he died ("she is not part of our family and never has been") and that Woodfox "has a debt to pay to society, as well as our family."
Injected Summary:  Albert Woodfox, a former Black Panther member, has been denied release from prison after a federal appeals court extended a temporary order barring his release. Woodfox was ordered released by a federal judge this week, but the state appealed and a three-judge panel of the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked his release. The panel extended the order until the state's appeal is resolved, with final legal briefs in the case due August 7. Woodfox has spent 43 years in solitary confinement, much of it in a cell without natural light, after the death of a prison guard in 1972. The case has been polarizing, with some believing Woodfox is innocent and others feeling he has a debt to pay to society and the victim's family.

Original Story:  – The University of Massachusetts at Amherst is backtracking less than two weeks after announcing a controversial policy barring Iranian nationals from some science and engineering programs, including physics, chemistry, and chemical engineering. After consulting with the State Department, the school says it will now create "individualized study plans to meet the requirements of federal sanctions law and address the impact on students," USA Today reports. The initial policy, revealed Feb. 6, was in response to a 2012 law and "conflicts with our institutional values and principles," UMass says in a statement, per NBC News. "It is now clear, after further consultation and deliberation, that we can adopt a less restrictive policy."

Original Story:  – A 35-year-old pregnant mom a month shy of her due date survived a grueling nine-hour, two-team surgery in which she delivered her baby—and underwent open-heart surgery. Edita Tracey tells MyFoxPhilly.com she was at her hair salon last month when her back started to hurt, and when the pain shifted to her chest she called 911: "The last thing I remember is emergency people coming, and that's it." At the hospital, the doctors got to work pinpointing the issue; a CT scan revealed a rare and serious problem: Tracey's aorta, the large blood vessel that pumps blood from the heart to the rest of the body, was bulging so badly there was a one-foot tear along it. The condition, known as aortic dissection, can be lethal in seconds—but the full anesthesia she'd need to undergo to repair it could harm the baby. So two surgical groups teamed up in the hopes of saving both Tracey and her child. The first team delivered the healthy baby girl by C-section within 30 seconds of her going under, and then the cardiac team opened Tracey's chest, drained the blood collecting around her heart and got to work rebuilding her aorta in a highly complicated surgery that took nine hours. Thanks to the surgeons' fast work, the Pennsylvania mom and baby Arabella are now home and doing well. "I think that the baby saved my life," Tracey tells ABC News, which reports a "perfect storm" of conditions seems to have led to her rare condition: Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disease that weakens blood vessels' walls, and preeclampsia, a pregnancy disorder characterized by high blood pressure.

Original Story:  – As investigators follow up on leads in the Boston Marathon bombing, the Boston Herald talks to security experts who say the attack may have been nearly impossible to prevent. That's because the use of an IED is "hard to stop ... in a free and open society," one expert explains. The device is easily hidden in a backpack, and since there were so many people at the event, it would have been impossible to check all bags. A retired FBI bomb technician echoes that sentiment, and adds that, "It would take some coordination, some know-how, and some intelligence," but "a one-man operation could easily do something like this." So how to prevent something similar? The first expert says we need to focus on controlling "homemade explosive precursors." As for the bombs, they were small and, according to initial tests, crude—no C-4 or high-grade explosives, CNN reports. The FBI has taken the lead on the investigation, which also involves a number of agencies, but little is known so far and no suspects have been identified. Still, investigators are currently tracking "a number of active leads."

Original Story:  – It may be too early for panic buying, but wine production has taken a hit from climate events this year and is close to a 20-year low, the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) warns. According to estimates released Thursday, global wine production will be down around 5% for 2016 as compared to 2015, with floods, drought, and frost hitting vineyards in countries including France, the AP reports. In Argentina, production may drop as much as 35%; in Chile, 21%, which the Guardian sees as possibly worrisome for malbec lovers. "Output was greatly affected by exceptional weather conditions," says OIV director Jean-Marie Aurand, per Bloomberg. "If there is one product that is vulnerable to weather events, it’s wine." This year's decline has been linked to the El Nino effect, though warming temperatures are starting to shrink wine-growing seasons around the world and could eventually lead to major shifts in what varieties of wine are produced in different countries, reports the Guardian. But the news wasn't all bleak: According to OIV's estimates, wine production is up for the year in countries including the Australia and the US; our estimated 22.5 million hectoliters is less than half of what the No. 1 producer, Italy, will log for the year: 48.8 million hectoliters. With total global production of around 35 billion bottles (based on an estimate of 259.5 million hectoliters), there should be enough to go around.

Original Story:  – Billion-year-old rocks pulled from deep below the Sahara Desert have revealed the earliest colored molecules found on Earth. They aren't black, brown, or even green. Instead, think pink. Nur Gueneli of Australian National University was examining molecules from crushed rocks discovered a decade ago by an oil company drilling into a marine shale deposit beneath Mauritania's Taoudeni Basin when she extracted a pink pigment. "I heard this screaming in the lab," then Gueneli came running with "this bright pink stuff," fellow researcher Jochen Brocks tells the Guardian. "It turned out to be real pigment, 1.1 billion years old." At least 500 million years older than other biological colors discovered, the pigment came from molecular fossils of chlorophyll, produced by tiny cyanobacteria that lived in ancient oceans, per a release. Imagine finding "fossilized dinosaur skin that after 100 million years was still iridescent green or blue," says Brocks, whose research was published in PNAS, per ABC Australia. "That's what we found" except the molecules "are 10 times older than a T-Rex would have been." Chlorophyll is generally associated with green organisms, but different subtypes carry different colors, explains Inverse. In this case, the bacteria range from blood red to deep purple, and appear pink when diluted with water. "The cyanobacterial oceans started to vanish about 650 million years ago, when algae (much bigger than cyanobacteria) began to rapidly spread to provide the burst of energy needed for the evolution of complex ecosystems, where large animals, including humans, could thrive on Earth," says Brocks. (This is the first new blue in 200 years.)

The suspected attacker was carrying an American passport and a Michigan driver's license, but the FBI determined that the documents were fake, according to the Jerusalem Post. The Israelis had just arrived on a flight from Tel Aviv and were on their way to a beach resort. At least 30 of them were injured in the attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said all signs point to the involvement of Iran, which he noted was also behind recent attempted attacks on Israelis in Thailand, India, and Georgia, CNN reports. "This is a global Iranian terror onslaught, and Israel will react firmly to it," he vowed.

Original Story:  – A commercial pilot was under the influence of alcohol while flying a JetBlue airliner carrying 151 passengers last year from Orlando, Fla., to New York City, federal prosecutors said Wednesday, per the AP. A criminal complaint says Dennis Murphy Jr. was selected for a random alcohol test after Flight 584 landed at Kennedy Airport on April 21, 2015. The court papers allege the test found that his blood alcohol level was 0.11, exceeding the 0.04 legal limit for pilots. A co-pilot later told investigators he saw Murphy "drinking an unknown beverage from a cup before and during" Flight 584 and another flight earlier in the day from New York to Orlando, the complaint says. On the way to being tested for alcohol, the pilot was red-faced and "chewing gum rapidly," it adds. The complaint says Murphy, 44, claimed the high reading was caused by the gum and asked why he was being tested for alcohol instead of drugs, the New York Daily News reports. Murphy was released on $50,000 bond after appearing Wednesday in federal court in Brooklyn, NY. In a statement, JetBlue said it has a "zero tolerance" drug and alcohol policy and that Murphy no longer works there. (Last month, an American Airlines co-pilot was arrested in Detroit after allegedly showing up for work drunk.)

The pilot, Dennis Murphy Jr., had a blood alcohol level of 0.11, exceeding the legal limit for pilots. A co-pilot observed Murphy drinking from a cup before and during the flight. Murphy was released on bond and no longer works for JetBlue, which has a zero tolerance policy for drug and alcohol use. This incident follows the arrest of an American Airlines co-pilot in Detroit for showing up for work drunk.

Original Story:  – Sixteen kids ranging in age from 13 to 17 were rescued in a prostitution sting linked to the Super Bowl, reports Fox News. The teens came from 13 different states, and some had been reported missing by their families, reports AP. Some were foreign nationals. The FBI said it arrested 45 pimps in the months-long sting, and they're accused of plotting to make the teenagers available to Super Bowl tourists in the New York City area, reports the Star-Ledger. "High-profile special events, which draw large crowds, have become lucrative opportunities for child prostitution criminal enterprises," said an FBI official in a statement. A different agency spokesperson said the arrests—made in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut in the weeks and months leading up to the game—weren't necessarily related, reports Time. About 50 adult women who authorities say were forced into prostitution also were rescued in the crackdown, say authorities.

Original Story:  – Happy Belly, Wickedly Prime, and Mama Bear may sound like characters in a children's cartoon, but they're something Amazon likely hopes will prove more lucrative. According to sources familiar with the development, these are names of brands that the online retailer is adding to its private-label offerings, including what the Wall Street Journal notes will be its "first broad push into perishable foods." These new in-house brands—initially available to the company's reported 50-million-plus Prime members and set to debut by the end of May or early June—are said to include such perishables as nuts, vitamins, spices, tea, coffee, vitamins, and baby food, as well as household items like laundry detergent and diapers. "We don't comment on rumors or speculations," a company spokeswoman said in an email to Reuters. Gone are the days when in-store brands were invariably viewed as cheap, substandard products: Per the Private Label Manufacturers Association, the sale of private-label brands increased by about $2.2 billion in 2015, reaching $118.4 billion, with a perception among some that store brands are of even higher quality than name brands, the Journal notes. And it seems to make sense for Amazon to expand its in-store line—it's been selling items such as its Elements baby wipes for some time—as these types of products offer higher profit margins; the company could also take advantage of its own data-culling to develop products that will appeal to its customers. "Amazon is 'carpet-bombing' the market with new products," a brand consultant tells the Journal. "Private label allows them to test out new prices and distinctive flavors with less risk." (Donald Trump is not Amazon's friend.)
Original Summary:  Amazon is launching three new private-label brands, Happy Belly, Wickedly Prime, and Mama Bear, which will offer perishable foods such as nuts, spices, tea, coffee, and baby food, as well as household items like laundry detergent and diapers. These new brands are part of Amazon's first push into perishable foods and will be available to the company's 50 million Prime members by the end of May or early June. Private label brands have become increasingly popular in recent years, with sales increasing by $2.2 billion in 2015 to reach $118.4 billion, and some consumers perceive store brands as being of higher quality than name brands. Amazon is expanding its private label offerings to take advantage of higher profit margins and to use its data-culling to develop products that will appeal to its customers. The launch of these new brands suggests that Amazon is "carpet-bombing the market with new products," according to a brand consultant.

Original Story:  – A flight school manager in California and his assistant have been arrested over a bizarre alleged plot to kidnap one of the students and deport him back to China. Police say flight instructor Jonathan McConkey and assistant Kelsi Hoser from the IASCO Flight Training went to the Redding apartment of 21-year-old Tianshu Shi last Thursday night and told him to pack because he had to go back to China, the Washington Post reports. Shi says he was "battered" by McConkey when they came for him the next morning, but he was able to call his brother in Shanghai before they took him to the local airport, where they had apparently planned to put him on one of the school's planes. The brother called police, who went to the airport and arrested McConkey and Hoser on suspicion of conspiracy and kidnapping, CNN reports. Shi believes they had planned to take him to the Bay Area and put him on a flight to China, the Record Searchlight reports. Shi recorded audio in which a man and a woman can be heard threatening him and telling them he is in their custody. "If you cannot speak English, you are not going to be able to stay here," the woman says. IASCO trains Chinese pilots for Chinese airlines, and Shi was at the flight school under a valid visa. He says he has been grounded for the last two months, apparently because of his struggle to learn English. "I can’t speak English well in life, but I can speak English well with air traffic control," he says.

The suspects, Jonathan McConkey and Kelsi Hoser, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy and kidnapping. Shi was able to call his brother in Shanghai before he was taken to the airport, who then contacted the police.

Original Story:  – It's not just banking: A copywriter for ad agency Young & Rubicam Indonesia collapsed last Saturday and died the next day, and fingers seem to be squarely pointed at two potential culprits: overwork and "Thai Red Bull." As Gawker reports, Mita Diran, who had worked for the company since May of last year, tweeted regularly about her epic workdays, posting this on Saturday: "30 hours of working and still going strooong." What came next: heart failure, a coma, death. Buzzfeed and Gawker are basing their reporting on local reports, with Buzzfeed citing a post from a supposed employee of Diran's father, who placed the blame on "too much Kratingdaeng" (the original Red Bull), writing that it "attacks her heart." Gawker points out that this is the second ad-agency death to make headlines this year: 24-year-old Li Yuan had clocked a month of 11pm work nights before collapsing at his desk at Ogilvy & Mather China and dying. (And then there's this intern.)
Original Summary:  A copywriter for Young & Rubicam Indonesia, Mita Diran, collapsed and died after working long hours, with some pointing to overwork and consumption of "Thai Red Bull" as possible causes. Diran had tweeted about her long workdays in the days leading up to her collapse. A local report blamed Diran's death on "too much Kratingdaeng," a type of energy drink. This is the second ad agency death to make headlines this year, following the death of a 24-year-old employee at Ogilvy & Mather China who had worked long hours. The intern's death has also raised concerns about workplace culture and stress.

Original Story:  – Paul Allen, billionaire earthling and co-founder of Microsoft, has long been obsessed with space, and his pet project Stratolaunch Systems is beginning to bear fruit. The Washington Post reports that Stratolaunch, shaping up to be the world's largest airplane, is now 76% assembled—no small accomplishment given the sheer size of the beast, a twin-fuselage behemoth expected to weigh (payload included) 1.3 million pounds, be powered by six 747 engines, boast landing gear with 28 wheels, and house 60 miles of wiring, among other feats. But to what end? Well, to shuttle rockets up to 35,000 feet and launch them into low Earth orbit. Oh, and to do this by the end of this decade. That's right: Someday it may actually be routine to transport people and objects in the couple-hundred-miles-above-Earth section of space, and Allen is willing to bet big on it. "When such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine," he says in a statement. GeekWire says walking into the hangar at the Mojave Air and Space Port "feels as if you're stepping into the Starship Enterprise's construction zone." No wonder, given the plane's 385-foot wing, which would put the aircraft on par with the fictional spaceship. Allen isn't saying how many millions he's put into it so far, but his head of operations says this isn't just a big plane, but a big idea—and not a billionaire's "vanity project." The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, rounds up some of the other big, or just simply bizarre, aircraft built in Southern California over the years, including Howard Hughes' Spruce Goose seaplane. (See why Allen has been putting money into coral reef, too.)

Original Story:  – North Korea is planning a rocket launch in the next few weeks, and the US is getting ready: Washington is shifting warships to the best spots to keep an eye on the launch, and perhaps defend against it, Reuters reports. The US is monitoring the run-up to the launch "very closely," says the head of the US Pacific Command. "To the degree that those ships are capable of participating in ballistic missile defense, then we will position them to be able to do that," he noted. The US made a similar move during a failed North Korean rocket launch in April. US monitoring will answer questions about the rocket, adds a Navy admiral, including: "What kind is it? What is it about? Where does it go? Who does it threaten?" While Pyongyang says it's trying to send a satellite into space, other countries, including the US, see the move as a ballistic missile test flouting UN resolutions. Regardless, the AP finds a potential wrinkle in North Korea's ambitions: Satellite images show that snow may have slowed its launch preparations; however, it could still be ready to go on Monday.

Original Story:  – Word has it that the pope told a woman in Argentina it was OK to take communion, even though she was married to a man who'd been divorced. The reports have prompted questions about whether the Catholic Church is changing its teachings on the matter—but the Vatican says it was a personal call and "consequences relating to the teaching of the church are not to be inferred." As NPR recounts, Jacquelina Lisbona had written to the pope seeking clarification on whether she was eligible for communion. The pope called Lisbona, her husband tells CNN, and "said she was absolved of all sins and she could go and get the Holy Communion because she was not doing anything wrong." According to the Daily Mail, the pope's call came seven months after the letter; he apologized for the lateness and said her question was one "that we are discussing at the Vatican, because a divorced person who takes communion is not doing any harm." More from the church: While the Vatican says the call occurred, the conversation "is between the pope and the woman," says a spokesman, via CNN. "The magisterium of the church is not defined by personal phone calls." The church is preparing for some serious crowds this Sunday as popes John Paul II and John XXIII are canonized, NPR reports. Rome's mayor says the city can cope, but a tour manager isn't so sure. "In a city which is nearly 2,800 years old and with a population—some say 2.5, some say 4 million—if 3 million people are coming in a city like this, there will problems without doubts." St. Peter's Square and its surroundings can handle some 250,000, a Vatican spokesman says.

Original Story:  – It's been more than three weeks since that first New York Times story opened the floodgates on the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment and assault scandal, and since that exposé, dozens of women have come forward with related stories to tell about the disgraced producer. A new story in the Times Monday is not only expanding the number of women making allegations, but also the timeline: Two women now say they were sexually assaulted by Weinstein in the 1970s, stretching the accusations out over four decades. Hope Exiner d'Amore, 62, says Weinstein raped her in a New York City hotel in the late '70s, while Cynthia Burr, also 62, says Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in a building hallway, also in NYC during the same period. "This has haunted me my entire life," Exiner d’Amore tells the Times, which also reveals other new allegations from two other women. In other Weinstein-related news, Vulture notes that "seeds of fresh chaos have been sewn" regarding the future of the Weinstein Company, and Harvey's brother, Bob, "is facing serious troubles of his own." Per two sources who claim they're tight with TWC execs, Bob is increasingly being pegged a "liability" by the company's board of directors. Although Bob has said he's "mortified and disgusted" at his older brother's behavior, there have been whispers that at heart he's simply Harvey's enabler. "Blood is thicker than water, and maybe that's what the board is thinking as well," notes a studio exec who's worked for both brothers. Not helping matters for Bob: sexual harassment allegations against him by an executive producer on a TWC TV series.

Original Story:  – As the world's richest and most powerful people leave the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, there was growing discussion about the impact the world's wealthiest could have, single-handedly, on the poverty rates of entire nations. One analyst at the Brookings Institution crunched some numbers and found that, if the richest resident of three countries—Swaziland, Colombia, and Georgia—distributed half their wealth over the next 15 years to those who live below the poverty line according to how far below it they reside, no one would live below the poverty line in that time. Ditto if multiple billionaires (as opposed to just one) in each of six other countries pool their resources. "This might all seem far-fetched," notes Quartz, "but some of the world’s richest people are already giving their money away." There's the example of Bill and Melinda Gates—who have given away $30 billion and have 100 others signed on to donate the majority of their wealth through the Giving Pledge. Similarly, Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan greeted the birth of their daughter with an open letter vowing to give away 99% of their Facebook shares, currently valued at $45 billion. The Brookings analyst hopes activity like this "could trigger a powerful demonstration effect of innovative solutions—not just for other billionaires, but for countries that are currently at risk of being left behind." The news comes as Oxfam International finds that the richest 1% of the world is just 62 people, and that their combined wealth equals that of the entire bottom half of the rest of the world (3.7 billion people and growing). (There are now more billionaires in this country than in the US.)
Original Summary:  The world's richest individuals, including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, have the potential to significantly reduce poverty rates in certain countries by distributing their wealth to those living below the poverty line. According to an analysis by the Brookings Institution, if just three billionaires in countries such as Swaziland, Colombia, and Georgia distributed half of their wealth to those in need, no one would live in poverty within 15 years. Similarly, if multiple billionaires in other countries pooled their resources, the impact could be even greater. The news comes as Oxfam International reveals that the world's richest 1% now owns as much wealth as the bottom half of the global population, highlighting the need for greater economic inequality.

Injected Summary:  The world's richest people attending the World Economic Forum in Davos were discussed, with an emphasis on their potential impact on poverty rates. An analyst at the Brookings Institution found that if the richest residents of three countries gave half of their wealth to those living in poverty, no one would be below the poverty line in 15 years. Similarly, if multiple billionaires in six other countries pooled their resources, the same outcome could be achieved. The Gateses and other billionaires have already given away significant amounts of money through the Giving Pledge. The analyst hopes this trend could inspire innovative solutions to address global poverty. Oxfam International found that the richest 1% of the world has the same wealth as the bottom half of the population, with 62 billionaires holding as much wealth as 3.7 billion people.

Original Story:  – For the last of the group of Navajo men who created a code that confounded the Japanese in World War II, "baa hane' yée éí t'áá kódiíji' bíighah silíí"—"his life story ends here"—fellow Navajo veterans say. Chester Nez, 93, who has died of kidney failure at his home in Albuquerque, was one of 29 men recruited for the Marine Corps' all-Navajo 382nd Platoon in 1942, the Arizona Republic reports. The "Code Talkers" used their native language, only spoken by a handful of non-Navajo at the time, to create a code the Japanese found impossible to crack. There were around 400 Code Talkers by the end of the war. Their mission remained classified until 1968, but survivors received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2001 and their work was dramatized in the 2002 movie Windtalkers. The code the men created matched Navajo words to military words, using turtle for "tank" and chicken hawk for "dive bomber," the BBC explains. Nez, who grew up in a family of shepherds in New Mexico, was still a teenager when he signed up and was sent to Guadalcanal. "When bombs dropped, generally we Code Talkers couldn't just curl up in a shelter," he recalled in his memoir, Code Talker. "We were almost always needed to transmit information, to ask for supplies and ammunition, and to communicate strategies. And after each transmission, to avoid Japanese fire, we had to move." The president of the Navajo nation has ordered flags to be flown at half-mast. "It saddens me to hear the last of the original Code Talkers has died," he tells Reuters. "We are proud of these young men in defending the country they loved using their Navajo language."

Original Story:  – A special committee of the FDA voted unanimously to recommend revoking approval of the best-selling cancer drug in the world as a treatment for breast cancer. The panel says Avastin is ineffective in treating breast cancer and unsafe, paving the way for the government to remove its endorsement, reports the Wall Street Journal. FDA chief Margaret Hamburg will make the final decision. "I think we all wanted Avastin to succeed but the reality is that these studies did not bear out that hope," says a patient representative on the panel. Following the vote, patients in the audience began shouting angrily at the committee. "What do you want us to take?" yelled one woman. "We have nothing else!" If the FDA continues with its withdrawal, drugmaker Roche could lose up to $1 billion in revenue from its top product, notes Reuters. Avastin is approved to treat other cancers, and that would not change no matter what Hamburg decides.

Original Story:  – Steve Bannon had planned an orderly departure from the White House, but it was scuppered by the violence in Charlottesville, insiders say. Sources tell the New York Times that new White House chief of staff John Kelly told the White House strategist in July that he would have to leave and they agreed on a date in mid-August, marking a year since Bannon joined the Trump team. But after Charlottesville, Bannon sought to push back the Aug. 14 departure date and stay on until at least Labor Day, worried that it would look like his departure was a response to events, the insiders say. He ended up leaving within days anyway after contradicting Trump's foreign policy in an interview with a liberal magazine. The insiders say that Bannon's departure was hastened by the "mutual disgust" between himself and the couple he called "Javanka" behind their backs: Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump. Bannon, who has now returned to Breitbart News, tells the Washington Post that he expects the turbulence in the Republican Party and the White House to continue. "No administration in history has been so divided among itself about the direction about where it should go," he says. According to Vanity Fair, Bannon now plans to use Breitbart to continue his feud with Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and other administration figures including National Security Adviser HR McMaster. (Here's what President Trump had to say about Bannon's departure.)

Original Story:  – The LA school district is taking flak for going after one of its own middle-school girls in court over a sexual abuse case. Attorneys for the district argued that the 14-year-old should be held responsible for a sexual relationship with a teacher and thus deserved no money for emotional trauma. They also presented the girl's sexual history in court—and won the case. Consider this quote from one of those attorneys, Keith Wyatt, to KPCC: "She lied to her mother so she could have sex with her teacher. She went to a motel in which she engaged in voluntary consensual sex with her teacher. Why shouldn't she be responsible for that?" Critics contend that the answer is obvious: An eighth-grader can't consent to a sexual relationship with a 28-year-old teacher. Or as a non-district attorney puts it in the Los Angeles Times: "The belief that middle-school children can consent to sexual activity is something one would expect to hear from pedophile advocates, not the second-largest school district in the US." The issue was a no-brainer in criminal court, where teacher Elkis Hermida was convicted of lewd acts against a child and sentenced to three years in prison. But as KPCC points out, the age of consent isn't as clear cut in civil cases. Critics of the Los Angeles Unified School District just wish it weren't a school district that exploited the discrepancy. Meanwhile, Wyatt's quote has caused so much outrage that the district says it will no longer use him for legal matters, reports AP.

Original Story:  – Twenty years ago, residents of British Columbia in northwestern Canada didn't have to worry about the deadliest mushroom in the world. But Amanita phalloides, the "death cap" mushroom, likely hitched a ride on trees being imported into the area to beautify city streets and is now flourishing, resulting in multiple poisonings. Just this week, it may have been responsible for the death of a 3-year-old boy in Victoria, reports the Globe and Mail. He died after going wild mushroom picking with his family and eating one. The death cap is said to look very similar to the popular paddy straw mushroom, with a white cap and yellowish stem that can be bulbous at its base. While toxicology results have yet to confirm what the boy ate, his family is urging the public to be aware of the risks; ingesting just one cap can be fatal, and the CBC reports that death caps are responsible for nine out of every 10 mushroom poisoning deaths in the world. "It's worthwhile learning how to recognize this particular species because of the consequences if you accidentally eat it," says one forest ecologist. Toxins attack multiple organs, including the kidneys and liver. (A pack of oddly behaving coyotes may have been tripping on mushrooms.)

Original Story:  – As Michael Scofield on the hit show Prison Break, Wentworth Miller not only received critical acclaim, he also cut a notably buff, tatted figure. But after the show ended in 2009, Miller disappeared, and a meme this week brought out why. Viral-photo-sharer The Lad Bible posted a pic of a trimmer Miller next to a photo of a heavier Miller in 2010, captioned: "When you break out of prison and find out about McDonald's monopoly…," Us Weekly reports. Miller caught wind of the "joke" and soon filled in the backstory. In a moving Facebook post, he notes that at the time the 2010 photo was taken, he had been flying under the radar because he was "suicidal" and suffering from deep depression, an issue that's affected him since childhood and that he's since discussed openly. "But at the time I suffered in silence," he writes. "Ashamed and in pain, I considered myself damaged goods. And the voices in my head urged me down the path to self-destruction." He adds he's glad that picture survived, however. "I am reminded of my struggle," he writes. "My endurance and my perseverance in the face of all kinds of demons. … Like a dandelion up through the pavement, I persist." He ends by encouraging others who are struggling to reach out for help, as well as noting that "the meaning I assign to this/my image is Strength. Healing. Forgiveness. Of myself and others." Meanwhile, a Lad Bible Facebook post Tuesday apologized to Miller, saying "we've got this very, very wrong" and adding "mental health is no joke or laughing matter." "Causing distress and upset to innocent or vulnerable people is simply not acceptable," the mea culpa reads. (Miller came out in 2013.)
