Original Story:  – Ted Cruz's 2016 chances are looking good if this is the best dirt anyone can dig up on him: The GOP's new chairman of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Space, and Competitiveness was apparently a member of the Beer Run Subcommittee in high school, according to public records unearthed by BuzzFeed. In his 2003 application to become Texas solicitor general, Cruz revealed that as a 17-year-old high school senior, he was ticketed for possession of alcohol as a minor after he was pulled over and a case of beer was found in his trunk. "Teenagers often make foolish mistakes, and that certainly applied to me as well," he tells BuzzFeed. Under the hashtag #TedCruzCrimes, Twitter users have suggested other possible dark deeds in the senator's past, including "Double-dipped his chip" and "Was not kind: Did not rewind," Bustle reports.
Original Summary:  Ted Cruz's 2016 chances are looking good as no major dirt was found on him despite a high school subcommittee membership and a past alcohol possession ticket. Cruz addressed the ticket as a teenage mistake and Twitter users joked about other potential past misdeeds.

Original Story:  – In the latest unkind cut in parenting battles, startling Wisconsin health ads are warning moms and dads that sleeping with their babies is the same as leaving a butcher knife next to them. The Milwaukee horror campaign against family "co-sleeping" reveals dozing babes cuddled next to knives almost as big as they are. "Is it shocking?" asked city Health Commissioner Bevan Baker. "Yes, but what is even more shocking is that 30 developed and underdeveloped countries have better" infant death rates than Milwaukee. A 7-week-old baby died the day the campaign was launched, the ninth infant to die in the city while sleeping with a parent in a year, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But angry campaign critics say sleeping together in a family bed is a natural situation practiced throughout the world, including in nations with lower infant death rates, and is generally safe, unless a parent is drunk or on drugs. The mayor, "unable to impact a failing school system or fix high unemployment, latched on to the first headline-grabbing distraction that came along," carped the Third Coast Digest. The Washington Post refers to the ads as "jaw-dropping," and points to popular baby expert William Sears, who offers tips for safe co-sleeping on his web site. "It doesn't mention butcher knives," notes the Post.
Original Summary:  The latest anti-co-sleeping campaign in Wisconsin is warning parents that sleeping with their babies is as dangerous as leaving a butcher knife next to them, with the risk of infant death increasing to 30 in the city. Critics argue that co-sleeping is a natural and generally safe practice, except when a parent is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, and that the campaign is a distraction from more pressing issues such as a failing school system and high unemployment.

Original Story:  – How many stars can you pack in a movie? When it comes to Inherent Vice, based on a 2009 novel by Thomas Pynchon, a lot. Alongside Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Martin Short, and Josh Brolin, Joaquin Phoenix stars as a stoner helping out his ex-girlfriend in 1970s California. Here's what critics are saying: Director Paul Thomas Anderson "gets so much contextually right here," writes Ella Taylor at NPR. But "that may be the problem. I love Anderson's ambition, but it is awfully hard to make a movie about a culture adrift that doesn't make its audience feel the same." She adds the film "runs a punishing 148 minutes, not enough of which are funny or sad enough to hold us." Claudia Puig at USA Today finds Inherent Vice "well-acted, intermittently compelling, often incoherent but always offbeat." Phoenix is especially strong "as an ultra-convincing doper, sporting some impressive mutton chops," though the movie is "too long." Still, "think of it as a film that's meant to be experienced, more than fully understood." The flick is packed with "hilarity, soulful reveries, stylistic ingenuity, and smashing performances that keep playing back in your head," writes Peter Travers at Rolling Stone. "It's the work of a major talent," yet "something's a little off." Perhaps it's Anderson's "excessive loyalty to Pynchon," Travers says. "It's Anderson's first constricted film, the one that never completely breaks free." Betsy Sharkey at the Los Angeles Times disagrees. "Inherent Vice is Pynchon and Anderson at their funniest, loosest, and most accessible," she writes. "Anderson has done a remarkable job of replicating the crazy kaleidoscope of crime, dope, and raunch the novelist conjured." All the elements "create such a good buzz you can almost get a contact high from watching."

Original Story:  – Although responses to Pope Francis have been chiefly positive, one dark stain in church history is raising serious questions about the new pope—the church's role during the dictatorship in Argentina, reports the Guardian. The church backed the dictatorship during its rule from 1976 to 1983, urging its followers to be patriotic and support the regime, too, even as thousands of people were abducted and murdered by the government, including many progressive priests. As the head of the Jesuit order in Argentina from 1973 to 1979, Jorge Bergoglio was part of the church hierarchy and has been accused of working with the dictatorship. In 2005, Bergoglio was accused in a lawsuit of withdrawing church protection from two anti-government priests, leading to their incarceration under brutal conditions in 1976, reports the New York Times. Bergoglio has called the allegation "slander" and claimed he worked behind the scenes to help the priests, but he has twice refused to testify in court about what his role had been. "I still have many doubts about his role regarding the Jesuits who went missing under the dictatorship," says the leader of a group of left-wing priests. Others praise Bergoglio for his role in the "monumental task" of healing the church's black eye after the war: "If he can restore the credibility of the church (in Argentina)," says one expert, "he can handle the scandals that have befallen the church worldwide.

Original Story:  – Critics are somewhat divided on Blood Done Sign My Name, a civil rights drama with more honesty than panache. Here’s what they’re saying: From its not-exactly-deep dialogue to its “not-quite-stereotypical but not-quite-real” characters, Blood “has the look and feel of a dependable TV movie,” says Steven Rea of the Philadelphia Inquirer. But the story is so “important and instructive” that it “nonetheless deserves attention.” It’s a clichéd movie, packed with “the kinds of scenes you've seen done better 100 other times,” says Kyle Smith of the New York Post. The white protagonist “shouldn’t even be in the movie,” existing only to show us that “a heinous killing supplied a useful lesson about racism to a little white kid.” Ronnie Scheib of Variety calls it a “painfully old-fashioned, flatly directed exercise in passionless historical reenactment.” A politically safe, lifeless script forces the actors to “slog through their designated roles.” It’s not a flashy movie, admits Roger Ebert; “Meat and potatoes, you could say,” he writes in the Chicago Sun-Times. “But it's thoughtful and moving,” a “level, unforgiving” account of a not-so-distant time.

Original Story:  – If you're a Democrat who found yourself cheering over the news that Michele Bachmann won't be seeking re-election next year, just stop. Bachmann just pretty much guaranteed the Republicans will manage to hold onto her seat, writes Sean Sullivan in the Washington Post. The only reason she almost lost to Jim Graves in 2012 is because, well, she's Michele Bachmann. But her 6th District is Minnesota's most conservative, and it should be easy for almost any other Republican to win it. "Had Bachmann run, the race would have shaped up as a referendum on her record. Period," Sullivan writes. "Now, Graves does not have the luxury of running against a wounded opponent." More reactions: At NBC News, Mark Murray, Domenico Montanaro, and Brooke Brower agree with Sullivan—Bachmann is "probably the only Republican who's at risk of losing that congressional seat"—and also note that "running for president doesn't always help your political career." See: Dennis Kucinich, Chris Dodd, Tommy Thompson. Who else is sad about this turn of events? Fact checkers, of course. Back in the Post, Glenn Kessler calls her "a fact checker's dream," "consistently and unapologetically ... fast and loose with the facts." He recounts the four "Four-Pinocchio ratings" she earned from that paper. But don't worry, Bachmann won't go far. "Unless she faces ongoing legal troubles, Bachmann will no doubt remain in public life, joining Sarah Palin on the ex-politician/grifter gravy train," predicts Joan Walsh on Salon. Also on Salon, Alex Seitz-Wald notes that Bachmann cited a devotion to term limits in her announcement, saying she doesn't think a person should serve in Congress more than eight years. Just one problem with that: When previously asked about term limits, she opposed them, Seitz-Wald points out.
Original Summary:  Michele Bachmann will not be seeking re-election in 2018, which could potentially benefit the Republican Party as she is the only Republican in the district who is at risk of losing. Bachmann has a history of factual inaccuracies and inconsistencies, which have led to four "Four-Pinocchio ratings" from the Washington Post fact-checking team.

Original Story:  – Toyota has introduced an odd new product, and no, it's not a car. The Japan-based automotive manufacturer just unveiled the Kirobo Mini, a small, humanoid robot designed to "invoke an emotional connection," according to chief design engineer Fuminori Kataoka. Toyota's robot is one of a "growing list" of companion devices coming out in the country, which is suffering population contraction due to a plethora of social factors, including a general lack of interest in marriage and children among young Japanese, Reuters reports. With a lack of caretakers for an increasingly elderly population, the country is turning to robots to fill the gap. The Kirobo Mini itself doesn't offer any functionality beyond companionship, though the palm-sized robot "wobbles a bit, and this is meant to emulate a seated baby, which hasn't fully developed the skills to balance itself," Kataoka says. It also comes with a "cradle" of sorts, designed to fit in the cupholder of one's car. According to Digital Trends, the Kirobo Mini was inspired by a larger robot Toyota made as a companion for a Japanese astronaut aboard the ISS. Toyota's betting the concept will be a hit down here on Earth, too, and it must be confident, as the device is priced at a whopping 39,800 yen (roughly $392), plus a $3 monthly subscription. The device will go on sale next year in Japan. (Robots tried to write a Beatles song, and kind of pulled it off.)

Original Story:  – A psychologist by the name of Walter Mischel died this month at age 88, and if the name doesn't ring a bell, a test he concocted in the 1960s just might. It's the "marshmallow test," and the premise is simple: Mischel presented young children with a marshmallow (or other treat) and offered a deal. If they could sit alone in a room with the marshmallow for a while without eating it, they'd get two when he returned, explains Quartz. As it turns out, only about 1 in 3 of the kids managed to refrain from eating it, notes the Washington Post. The test gained renown when Mischel followed up with the kids and found a striking correlation: Those who learned to master the art of self-gratification tended to be more successful later in life. But as Mischel himself would stress, the results often were misinterpreted in the mainstream. One key part of his test that often goes unmentioned, he once explained, is that some of the kids were taught strategies on how to keep from eating the marshmallow, while others were left to their own devices, reports NPR. The main lesson, then, was that people can teach themselves better habits rather than relying on sheer willpower. "People can use their wonderful brains to think differently about situations, to reframe them, to reconstrue them, to even reconstrue themselves," Mischel said. (See this video for the interview.) Another facet of Mischel's life: He grew up as a Jewish child in Austria before World War II, and he gave a 2014 interview to the Guardian in which he talks about the hardships he endured. Mischel's family fled to the US in 1938.

Original Story:  – Cave bears, the close cousin of the brown bear, roamed vast swaths of present-day Russia across to the United Kingdom and down to Spain for hundreds of thousands of years until they went extinct 25,000 years ago. A large beast at roughly 12 feet long and 5 feet tall at the shoulder, the cave bear—so named because they hibernated in caves, though they didn't live in them—left behind a trove of bones and teeth for scientists to study, so one group decided to investigate their teeth for clues to their mysterious extinction, reports Phys.org. What they learned is that the bears, unlike their omnivorous relatives today, were "strict" vegans, eschewing fish, small mammals, and insects, they report in the Journal of Quaternary Science. "Similar to today's giant panda, the cave bears were therefore extremely inflexible in regard to their food," one researcher writes. "We assume that this unbalanced diet, in combination with the reduced supply of plants during the last ice age, ultimately led to the cave bear's extinction." Of course, this is just an assumption, and the scientists say they're now working on studying more teeth and bones to learn more. So far the team has been able to use a portable scanner popular with dentists to create 3D scans of molars from the lower jaws of cave bears and other bears that today roam the Northern Hemisphere, such as black Asiatic and polar bears, reports Science magazine. The team also notes a head-scratcher: Two cave bear cubs had collagen suggestive of a vegan diet, though they were nursing. (This man survived being pulled into a cave by a bear.)
Original Summary:  Cave bears, a close relative of brown bears, roamed across Europe and Asia for hundreds of thousands of years until they went extinct 25,000 years ago. A recent study found that these bears were strict vegans, only eating plants, and their extinction may have been due to a lack of food sources during the last ice age.

What they learned is that the bears, unlike their omnivorous relatives today, were "strict" vegans, eschewing fish, small mammals, and insects, they report in the Journal of Quaternary Science. "Similar to today's giant panda, the cave bears were therefore extremely inflexible in regard to their food," one researcher writes. "We assume that this unbalanced diet, in combination with the reduced supply of plants during the last ice age, ultimately led to the cave bear's extinction." Of course, this is just an assumption, and the scientists say they're now working on studying more teeth and bones to learn more. So far the team has been able to use a portable scanner popular with dentists to create 3D scans of molars from the lower jaws of cave bears and other bears that today roam the Northern Hemisphere, such as black Asiatic and polar bears, reports Science magazine. The team also notes a head-scratcher: Two cave bear cubs had collagen suggestive of a vegan diet, though they were nursing. (This man survived being pulled into a cave by a bear.)
Injected Summary:  Cave bears, a close relative of brown bears, roamed across Europe and Asia for hundreds of thousands of years until they went extinct 25,000 years ago. A recent study found that these bears were strict vegans, only eating plants, and their extinction may have been due to a lack of food sources during the last ice age.

Original Story:  – The new BBC sketch comedy show Revolting didn't wait long before jumping into controversy: Its very first episode featured a Real Housewives of ISIS skit, Rolling Stone reports. It's exactly what you'd expect—a spoof of Bravo's Real Housewives franchise in which the wives of ISIS fighters complain about not having a thing to wear to a beheading, show off their fancy new suicide vests, and rejoice in the fact that the new chain their husband bought to tie them up with is almost long enough to allow them outside. It's proving unsurprisingly controversial. Many commenters on social media complained that the sketch made light of the very real issue of young girls being groomed online and turned into jihadi brides, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Per one commenter: The sketch has "all the fun of an off-base Amy Schumer skit with the same lack of awareness of anything other than itself" and is "only funny if you look down on someone else and enjoy seeing them unhappy because they are not white and Christian." But the show's creators tell the i newspaper that's the exact issue they're trying to highlight. "The target is online grooming. It’s about people who are vulnerable to these kind of approaches," says Jolyon Rubinstein. Adds Heydon Prowse, "It's important not to pull your punches in satire. You have to be fearless or it undermines your credibility. You can't go after David Cameron for five years like we did [on a previous show] and not go after Islamic State."

Original Story:  – First moose hunting, now a bear stare down. That's what happened to Sarah Palin when a brown bear and her two cubs crashed a quiet family salmon fishing expedition in Alaska. The mothers stared at one another before the bear blinked, and moved off, reports the Telegraph. The bear apparently knows a mama grizzly when she sees one—at least the political kind Palin extols in her new video. Or maybe the bear heard about the dead grizzly Palin likes to sit on. The hide of a grizzly shot by Palin's pop covers the couch in the former governor's Anchorage office. Youch. That's one grizzly who won't be voting Tea Party.

Original Story:  – Hamid Karzai has delayed the inauguration of Afghanistan’s newly elected parliament, at the behest of a court he appointed himself to hear complaints from losing candidates largely loyal to him. Those candidates complain that fraud and security concerns excluded many people from the vote. But Karzai’s international allies insist the election was legitimate, and say the court he appointed to handle disputes is unconstitutional. Diplomats spent yesterday imploring Karzai to instate the new lawmakers on Sunday as scheduled. It didn't work, but the lawmakers say they plan to convene anyway, notes the Wall Street Journal. Karzai’s been ruling by fiat since the election, something that makes the West nervous. “We cannot afford a country without a Parliament,” one diplomat tells the New York Times. “For Western taxpayers who are hungry for good news, this looks awful.” But instating the election’s winners has its dangers, too. Most of those allegedly excluded from the vote were Pashtuns in the war-torn south, and the losing candidates argue that excluding them will drive more people to the Taliban.

Titled "King of Bain: When Mitt Romney Came to Town," the film was produced by a former Romney adviser who had actually sought work on Mitt's 2012 campaign. “I have no idea what happened here,” a former associate says. As for the film, it talks to workers who lost their jobs and faced home foreclosures after Bain Capital—a private equity firm Romney helped start—acquired companies and forced layoffs. "This is not capitalism. This is predatory,” says a senior adviser of Winning Our Future, the PAC that won a bidding war for the film yesterday. A Romney rep calls it "puzzling to see Speaker Gingrich and his supporters continue their attacks on free enterprise."

Original Story:  – As expected, President Trump signed new Russian sanctions into law on Wednesday—"quietly," reports the Hill. And, it turns out, with loud reservations. Both the House and Senate passed the sanctions by overwhelming, veto-proof margins—517 in favor, just 5 against across both houses—as retaliation for Russian interference in the 2016 election, reports the AP. Trump opted not to try to defy Congress. But he did release two signing statements. What you need to know: Politico reports the White House released two statements (here and here) nearly simultaneously. A line from one: "In its haste to pass this legislation, the Congress included a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions," including one that "purport[s] to displace the President's exclusive constitutional authority to recognize foreign governments." A line from the other: The bill "remains seriously flawed–particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch's authority to negotiate ... and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together. The Framers of our Constitution put foreign affairs in the hands of the President. This bill will prove the wisdom of that choice. Yet despite its problems, I am signing this bill for the sake of national unity." For context, Bloomberg notes that signing statements are nothing new: George W. Bush and Barack Obama issued them in instances where they weren't thrilled with what they were signing. So what are the sanctions? The Los Angeles Times has a primer: One set focuses on hobbling Russia's ability to export weapons. Another involves its energy sector, and that's one instance where the EU is irked over the possibility of being unintentionally affected: Russia and Germany are currently working on a natural gas pipeline that would run between them. Two other facets of note, per the Washington Post: North Korea and Iran also see new sanctions imposed under the legislation, and no sanctions can be lifted without Congress' OK. Interesting side note from the LAT: The bill was born out of concern over North Korea and Iran's nuclear weapons programs; Russia wasn't included until later. Vladimir Putin, who continues to deny any such meddling, previously responded to the proposed sanctions with US penalties of his own. One take from Ryan Lizza of the New Yorker: "Trump has expressed more concerns about Congress's Russia sanctions bill than about Putin's expulsion of US diplomats." And another from GOP Arizona Sen.

Original Story:  – The mystery holes that plague an Indiana sand dune—and triggered its public closure when one in July 2013 swallowed a 6-year-old boy who nearly died—are apparently caused by a "ghost forest" of underground trees and "cement." Per a recent study, buried trees at Mount Baldy dune are decaying in such a way that gives the holes—the former branches and trunks—a temporary structure, the AP reports. As for how the hollow shapes hold that structure, scientists point to a "calcium-carbonate-rich cement" found "at the contact between organic material [the decaying trees] and sands." In the sand, parts of "decayed trees progressively collapse and infill, and open holes are temporarily stabilized" by the cement, the researchers wrote in Aeolian Research in December. "Further, holes can exist undetected at the surface, covered by a thin veneer of sand." Lead author Erin Argyilan is working to figure out what's causing the "cement," which may flourish when tree-decaying fungi comes in contact with sand. "It’s not in the sand. Is it the tree itself? Is it the fungus? The sediment? What is the key factor that is making this happen? The work we are doing now will show ... how the materials got there," she tells Indiana University Northwest News. She's also involved in a study that will create a map of possibly dangerous areas at the dune using 1930s photos that show where the trees stood before the migrating sands—the dune moves an average 10 to 13 feet a year—buried them. No one's saying whether Mount Baldy at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore will reopen, but there may be a bigger question: "There are actually a lot of places around the country ... where dunes are covering trees," says Argyilan, whose findings could be used to assess risk elsewhere. (In California sand dunes, archaeologists found a giant sphinx.)

The district board voted 3-0 last night in a closed session to accept the deal, which also mandates that Selleck stop having Calleguas water brought to his Hidden Valley ranch, the Los Angeles Times notes. A statement from Selleck's lawyer said the Magnum, PI actor was "pleased" with the agreement, though there were still some discrepancies between Selleck's story and that of the water district, per the newspaper. "Mr. Selleck did not receive any notifications prior to last week stating that he was acting outside of regulations decreed by the county," the statement read, adding that Selleck had "previously paid for all the water that he utilized, which the Calleguas Municipal Water District acknowledged had not been stolen." But the district said it sent cease-and-desist letters to Selleck in 2013, and Calleguas' general manager says that even if Selleck had paid for the water, it's still illegal to transport water from one district to another—and that residents outside the district don't pay taxes and other fees that go toward the water infrastructure's upkeep. "The water delivered and used in this case was not fully paid for, period," she says.

Original Story:  – She may sport what appear to be whisker lines across her expressionless face, but the iconic Hello Kitty may not be a cat. In fact, the cartoon character created 40 years ago has a whole backstory that will soon be on display at an exhibit at the Japanese American National Museum in LA, reports the Los Angeles Times in an interview with one of the curators. For starters, Kitty White is her proper name, she's a third-grade girl from outside of London, she has a twin sister (they're Scorpios), she loves apple pie, and she has a pet cat named Charmmy Kitty. And oh yeah, she's not (exactly) a cat. The revelation, which has since been walked back a bit, made headlines: Writes the LA Times' Carolina Miranda in her own report, "I grew up with Hello Kitty everything and all I have to say is, MIND BLOWN." Over at the Washington Post, Alexandra Petri sums up typical reaction: "If you were wondering whether everything is a lie, the answer is: yes. Everything is a lie." Hello Kitty creator Sanrio confirmed the news to an incredulous Time reporter and included her official bio, which features this gem: "As tall as five apples, and as heavy as three, Hello Kitty is a bright little girl with a heart of gold." But after the uproar, the story changed a bit: RocketNews24 called Sanrio's PR department, and the person who answered said, "We never said she was a human," explaining that she's a "personification or anthropomorphization"—not quite human, but also not quite cat. Kotaku got a similar response from Sanrio's Tokyo HQ: "Hello Kitty was done in the motif of a cat. It's going too far to say that Hello Kitty is not a cat. Hello Kitty is a personification of a cat." The site notes that the original story used the word "girl," not "human." Either way, the upcoming exhibit is set to include hundreds of pieces of Hello Kitty art, merchandise, and fashion, including the famous Lady Gaga dress, and will be followed two weeks later by the inaugural Hello Kitty Con at the Museum of Contemporary Art. (Meanwhile, a 5-year-old girl was suspended from school for her apparently menacing talk about her Hello Kitty bubble shooter.)
Original Summary:  Hello Kitty, the beloved cartoon character, may not be a cat as previously thought. The character, created 40 years ago, has a backstory that includes being a third-grade girl from outside of London, having a twin sister, and loving apple pie, but is not exactly human or cat.

Please focus on relevant details, only answer with the summary.– She may sport what appear to be whisker lines across her expressionless face, but the iconic Hello Kitty may not be a cat. In fact, the cartoon character created 40 years ago has a whole backstory that will soon be on display at an exhibit at the Japanese American National Museum in LA, reports the Los Angeles Times in an interview with one of the curators. For starters, Kitty White is her proper name, she's a third-grade girl from outside of London, she has a twin sister (they're Scorpios), she loves apple pie, and she has a pet cat named Charmmy Kitty. And oh yeah, she's not (exactly) a cat. The revelation, which has since been walked back a bit, made headlines: Writes the LA Times' Carolina Miranda in her own report, "I grew up with Hello Kitty everything and all I have to say is, MIND BLOWN." Over at the Washington Post, Alexandra Petri sums up typical reaction: "If you were wondering whether everything is a lie, the answer is: yes. Everything is a lie." Hello Kitty creator Sanrio confirmed the news to an incredulous Time reporter and included her official bio, which features this gem: "As tall as five apples, and as heavy as three, Hello Kitty is a bright little girl with a heart of gold." But after the uproar, the story changed a bit: RocketNews24 called Sanrio's PR department, and the person who answered said, "We never said she was a human," explaining that she's a "personification or anthropomorphization"—not quite human, but also not quite cat. Kotaku got a similar response from Sanrio's Tokyo HQ: "Hello Kitty was done in the motif of a cat. It's going too far to say that Hello Kitty is not a cat. Hello Kitty is a personification of a cat." The site notes that the original story used the word "girl," not "human." Either way, the upcoming exhibit is set to include hundreds of pieces of Hello Kitty art, merchandise, and fashion, including the famous Lady Gaga dress, and will be followed two weeks later by the inaugural Hello Kitty Con at the Museum of Contemporary Art.

Original Story:  – The Supreme Court wrestled with a high-profile case on Wednesday—how far religious groups must go in helping employees gain access to birth control under ObamaCare. Based on the arguments, don't expect a clear resolution: The New York Times reports that a 4-4 tie is a "real possibility," an outcome that would not set national legal precedent but would affirm the four lower-court rulings under review. All of those rulings sided in favor of ObamaCare, but the upshot is that until a national precedent is set, "religious groups in different parts of the country would have conflicting obligations if they object to covering contraception." And the AP notes that the case could be re-argued anyway when a ninth justice joins the court. The linchpin of the case comes down to a single word—"hijacking," writes Lyle Denniston at SCOTUSBlog. It came up in various forms seven times during arguments, he observes. Religious employers that oppose covering contraceptives accuse the government of "hijacking" their plans. The health care law allows such groups to opt out of providing birth-control coverage as long as they fill out a form and notify the government they are doing so. The government then steps in to make sure the coverage is provided. Religious groups say this workaround "still makes them complicit in providing contraception for their employees," notes NPR. John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas seem to agree, and, based on his skeptical questions and comments Wednesday, swing vote Anthony Kennedy does, too. "The church plans here, religious organization plans here, are, in effect, subsidizing the conduct that they deemed immoral," Kennedy said at one point. The justices could say as early as next week if they seem destined for a 4-4 tie, or wait until June, reports the AP.
Original Summary:  The Supreme Court heard arguments in a high-profile case regarding the extent to which religious groups must comply with the Affordable Care Act's requirement to provide birth control coverage for their employees. The justices appeared divided, with a 4-4 tie possible, which would affirm lower court rulings in favor of the ACA but leave the issue unresolved nationally.

Original Story:  – Vladimir Putin is again taking time out of his Herculean schedule to sit down with foreign media in advance of next month's Winter Olympics in Sochi, and used the opportunity to try to downplay Russia's anti-gay laws—sort of. "Everybody is invited to Sochi," he told ABC in an interview airing today. "I couldn't care less about their sexual orientation. We will welcome all athletes and all visitors to the Olympics. None of our guests will have any problems." Other highlights of his comments from interviews conducted Friday, courtesy of Politico, Reuters, the Guardian, and the AP: On calls to boycott the Sochi Olympics: "The Russian people have their own cultural code, their own tradition. We don't interfere, don't stick our noses in their life and we ask that our traditions and culture are treated with the same respect." On US states that criminalize homosexual acts: "We have no such thing, people can feel free and at ease, but please leave the children in peace." Reuters notes that he did not elaborate on that last part. And furthermore: "It seems to me that the law we adopted doesn't harm anybody. What's more, homosexual people can't feel inferior here, because there is no professional, career, or social discrimination against them. When they achieve great success, for example Elton John—he's an extraordinary person, a distinguished musician, and millions of our people sincerely love him, regardless of his sexual orientation." On what he'll be watching: "Everybody in our country likes figure skating, I do too. I like cross-country skiing, biathlon, Alpine skiing. This is what I know and what I like ." On Edward Snowden: "Mr. Snowden is subject to the treatment of provisional asylum here in Russia. He has a right to travel freely across the country, he has no special limitation, he can just buy a ticket and come here." As to Snowden being able to stay in Russia indefinitely, Putin said, "Yes, sure, definitely." Meanwhile, Politico takes a lengthy look inside the Sochi Olympics here.

Original Story:  – Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has lost his credibility, the trust of voters, the support of former allies on the city council, and even his invite to the Santa Claus Parade—but he's gained a TV show. The mayor, increasingly isolated after a long stream of scandals, will begin hosting a show called "Ford Nation" on Canada's Sun News Network next week, reports CNN, which notes that critics call the network "Fox News North." The network—comparing Ford to Rush Limbaugh or Howard Stern—says the show will pick up where Ford and his brother Doug's radio show left off. "You just never know what he is going to say," the network says. But while the man now famous worldwide as Canada's crack-smoking mayor may have a media career in front of him, his days of running Toronto may soon be over. City councillors—some of whom have begun turning their backs whenever Ford speaks—are finalizing a motion to strip him of his budget and nearly all his powers, leaving him "mayor in name only," the National Post reports. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, meanwhile, says Ford's behavior is "truly disturbing" and she is willing to give the city council "new tools" they could use to get rid of him, as long as the measures have cross-party support, reports the Toronto Star.

Original Story:  – Brad Pitt didn’t believe in the death penalty … until the BP oil spill. Now he says he is “willing to look at it again” when it comes to those responsible for the crisis. The remark is part of Spike Lee’s documentary, If God is Willing and Da Creek Don’t Rise, premiering tonight on HBO. The film, marking the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, is a follow-up to his 2006 When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts. Lee said the film was planned to be “much more upbeat,” but then the Gulf oil spill happened, the Daily Mail reports. Pitt’s not the only one who’s angry: In an interview with GQ, Lee says he doesn’t know “why Obama ever trusted these BP guys! They would lie to their mothers. Hayward does not give a fuck. The thing we don't talk about is that eleven Americans lost their lives and it took seven weeks to invite their families to the White House. I'm not trying to bash my man, but that's a long time.” Click here for more.

Original Story:  – If you're in China and craving pork, probably best to hold off for a bit. Two farmers, along with a third suspect, were arrested for allegedly selling tainted pork in the country, and authorities are still looking for 44 tons of the stuff. The suspects got their hands on the meat in a fairly twisted manner, according to police: The government had hired the farmers to collect and dispose of sick and dead pigs using bio-safety methods, China Daily reports. Instead, police say they confessed to having sold pork cut from those pigs to meat processors since August. Police are still trying to figure out who bought the tainted pork; here's one disturbing sentence from China Daily: "They hope to find the meat before it is eaten." Police were tipped off in March that the suspects were storing diseased pigs in a freezer; officers eventually found more than 25 tons of disease-infected pork there, and the farmers and their driver were detained after being found transporting more than seven tons of dead pigs in a truck. Time notes that more than 900 people have been busted for selling tainted or fake meat in the past three months alone (including rat meat sold as lamb).

Original Story:  – Amid the fallout from the release of the GOP-produced memo on alleged FBI surveillance overreach, House Democrats are pushing for the release of their own memo. Democrats, who are expected to call for a vote in a Monday afternoon meeting of the House Intelligence Committee, say their document will serve as a rebuttal to claims in the GOP document and adds context to the FBI and DOJ decision to wiretap former Trump aide Carter Page, the New York Times reports. The GOP-controlled committee voted against releasing the Democratic memo at the same time as the Republican memo, but they now say they're willing to release it, which would require the approval of President Trump. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged Trump on Sunday to approve the release of the memo, saying failure to do so would "confirm the American people's worst fears that the release of Chairman Nunes' memo was only intended to undermine Special Counsel Bob Mueller's investigation," CNN reports. Republican sources, meanwhile, tell Axios that there are several more memos to come detailing "areas of concern," including political bias and possible efforts to aid Hillary Clinton's campaign, at agencies including the FBI and the State Department, and that releasing them won't require the same extensive declassification procedure as the Russia memo. House Intelligence Committee chief Rep. Devin Nunes said Friday that they are now in "phase two" of their investigation.

Original Story:  – After police in Manhattan found a 61-year-old man dead in a parked car in late August, they identified him as Geoffrey Corbis and said it appeared he died of natural causes. Turns out, his name was actually Geoffrey Weglarz, and he died by suicide after ingesting poison he bought on the dark web. How Weglarz came to this end under a different name is the subject of a fascinating New York Times story by Michael Wilson. A friend says Weglarz "had it all"—a wife and son, a big house in Connecticut, a passion for acting, and a career in software design that took him around the world. Then came the divorce and Weglarz's departure from Dell in 2011. (The Connecticut Post also mentions medical and mental health issues.) Two years later, Weglarz told PBS' Newshour in a story about jobless older Americans that he'd applied to 481 jobs with no luck, and had only $2,000 to his name. And another bad turn: Weglarz was accused of throwing a sandwich at a pregnant McDonald's worker in 2013, and he changed his surname to Corbis to avoid unflattering news reports. He never did shake his financial struggles. Shortly before he died, he told his sister he'd acquired poison used for euthanasia. "That way, when I'm ready, I can go painlessly and fast," he reportedly said. She thought she knew the outcome when Weglarz sent her a text shortly before 6pm on Aug. 24. "Stuff does taste as bad as I thought it would," it read. The Times has more, including on a final, vain bank visit. (A suicide pact is suspected in another NYC case.)

Original Story:  – Guam may become the first US territory to allow same-sex marriage after its attorney general today ordered it to be so. Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson instructed officials to start processing same-sex marriage applications, citing an appeals court decision that found state bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional, the AP reports. The move came two days after same-sex couple Kathleen Aguero and Loretta Pangelinan filed a legal challenge to Guam's marriage laws after they were unable to submit a marriage application, the Los Angeles Times reports. However, applications won't be accepted "until further notice," the acting director of Guam's Department of Public Health and Social Services told the Pacific Daily News after the directive was issued. "From my side, I just received a letter. It's not a legal opinion." Gov. Eddie Calvo then released a statement announcing that his administration will defer a decision on the issue, though the department in charge of marriage applications earlier hoped a decision would be made by Friday. "If it is the will of the people of Guam to make same-sex marriage legal on Guam, then the Guam Legislature, the people of Guam's representatives, can take action to change the law, or a referendum can be held giving the people of Guam a direct voice in this issue," Calvo and Lt. Gov. Ray Tenorio said in the statement. Barrett-Anderson's office said, in its original directive, "The ultimate decision on whether Guam's statute is constitutional will be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in June. The Supreme Court's decision, however, to lift the stay in the [US 9th Circuit Court of Appeals] decision permits individuals in all nine states [covered by the circuit court] and Guam to the enjoyment of their right to marry regardless of gender."

Original Story:  – We just don't learn, do we? Shortly after beachgoers in Argentina killed a baby dolphin, tourists in China are accused of killing two peacocks in an attempt to snap a selfie. Officials say the visitors were told not to touch the animals at Yunnan Zoo in Kunming on Feb. 12 but grabbed two peacocks anyway after luring them with food, per Mashable and the South China Morning Post. One photo shows a man gripping a peacock tightly against his body while a woman appears to pet the animal and a boy grabs its tail feathers. Zoo officials say the animals had feathers torn out in an area of the zoo where visitors can get close to hundreds of peacocks, per Shanghaiist.

Shortly after beachgoers in Argentina killed a baby dolphin, tourists in China are accused of killing two peacocks in an attempt to snap a selfie. Officials say the visitors were told not to touch the animals at Yunnan Zoo in Kunming on Feb. 12 but grabbed two peacocks anyway after luring them with food, per Mashable and the South China Morning Post. One photo shows a man gripping a peacock tightly against his body while a woman appears to pet the animal and a boy grabs its tail feathers. Zoo officials say the animals had feathers torn out in an area of the zoo where visitors can get close to hundreds of peacocks, per Shanghaiist.

Original Story:  – A former Playboy model who says she slept with President Trump can now say it all she wants—in even greater detail. Karen McDougal settled her lawsuit Wednesday with the tabloid company American Media Inc. on terms that let her fully discuss the alleged affair, the New York Times reports. "It's a total win," says her lawyer Peter Stris. "We got everything we were fighting for—she got out of the contract, gets the life rights back and owes AMI nothing more." An elated McDougal says she's doing a "victory dance" but has no immediate plans. "I am relieved to be able to tell the truth about my story when asked," she says in a statement per CBS News. McDougal sold her Trump-story rights to AMI for $150,000 in 2016, but later sued the company, saying chairman David Pecker misled her and Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen got inappropriately involved. AMI appeared ready to fight McDougal until the feds raided Cohen's office earlier this month and seized information on her lawsuit and AMI, per insiders in the case. Wednesday's settlement grants AMI up to $75,000 in future profits from McDougal's story and protects Trump from legal responsibility regarding attempts to buy women's stories during the presidential campaign. Trump still denies having had an affair with McDougal.

Original Story:  – Donald Trump says Bill Clinton's marital infidelity is "fair game" on the campaign trail, and, apparently, so is his own. Asked on Tuesday whether it would be fair for Trump's rivals to scrutinize his past "indiscretions"—he famously had an affair with model/actress Marla Maples before divorcing Ivana Trump in the 1990s—the candidate answered in the affirmative, per CNN. "Yes, they would be." Earlier Tuesday, Trump continued his digs at Clinton, who is expected to campaign for his wife in New Hampshire next week. "There certainly were a lot of abuse of women, and you look at whether it's Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones, or many of them," Trump said on the Today Show, per the New York Times. "Certainly if they play the woman's card with respect to me, that will be fair game." In 2008, Trump said Bill Clinton's affair with Lewinsky was "unimportant." But he clarified on Tuesday that those comments were a business "obligation" at a time "when I needed approvals, when I needed something from Washington," per CNN. "Frankly, Hillary brought up the whole thing with 'sexist,' and all I did was reverse it on her because she's got a major problem, happens to be right in her house," Trump said Tuesday. "If she wants to do that, we're going to go right after … the ex-president," he added. A rep for Hillary Clinton tells NBC News she "won't be bullied or distracted" by the attacks, which are also being hurled by Rand Paul. On Monday, Paul described Bill Clinton as Hillary's "women's problem," reports CNN.
Original Summary:  Donald Trump has stated that his rivals should scrutinize his past "indiscretions," including his affair with Marla Maples, which he previously downplayed in 2008. He also criticized Bill Clinton's past infidelities and suggested that Hillary Clinton's campaign is "fair game" for scrutiny in response.

Original Story:  – In four days, The Interview pulled in $15 million, Sony Pictures says in a press release. That's in the period through Saturday, during which, Sony says, the film was rented or bought two million times online, deadline.com reports. But its success so far isn't something to be proud of, writes David Rogers at Politico. It's all about "a real live person" being assassinated, and that's not funny. "When did assassination become a subject for American humor?" Rogers wonders. "This is a nation that still mourns Abraham Lincoln, John Kennedy, and Martin Luther King." "If America is to be a moral force, doesn’t it have to look inside itself as to what killing really is?" he asks, questioning how we'd react if, for instance, "North Korea made a comedy about white racists plotting to assassinate Obama." As for the president's own comments on the movie: Obama may make light of the Seth Rogen effort, but killing, Rogers writes, is "a shadow on your soul that you carry forever." He compares the silly film to another recent movie, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper, which tells the story of former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. Kyle was killed last year: Would he find The Interview funny? Rogers asks. Click for the full piece, or read another stance from a critic who calls the film "an insult to satire."

Original Story:  – A small new study offers an intriguing clue about the baffling ailment known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Researchers in the UK say CFS, also known by its more scientific name of myalgic encephalomyelitis, appears to be triggered by an overactive immune system, reports the Guardian. Those who have CFS—including Seabiscuit and Unbroken author Laura Hillenbrand—suffer not just debilitating fatigue, but headaches, nausea, vertigo, and other symptoms that leave them unable to complete even the most basic tasks. The study suggests that sufferers may have an immune system that is genetically predisposed to go into hyper-drive when a virus or infection shows up, reports CNN. When it does, the cascade of debilitating—and easily misdiagnosed—symptoms begins. If the researchers are right, it could be a big first step on a poorly understood ailment. "This is a light in the fog, a direction of travel," says King's College London researcher Carmine Pariante, per the BBC. "Although screening is a long way off, our results are the first step in identifying those at risk and catching the illness in its crucial early stages." The study involved 55 people with hepatitis C who were given the standard treatment of the drug interferon-alpha. This treatment typically produces symptoms consistent with CFS, and the researchers measured levels of a protein linked to inflammation in participants' blood before, during, and afterward. Eighteen people had a particularly strong immune reaction to the treatment—including fatigue—and they also had higher levels of the suspect protein before the treatment began.

Original Story:  – As Hurricane Irma was advancing on Florida, this was the message deaf residents of Manatee County received regarding a mandatory evacuation: "Help you at that time to use bear big." Jason Hurdich, a Clemson University professor and expert in American Sign Language, tells the Bradenton Herald he couldn't understand 95% of what a deaf interpreter was signing during the Sept. 8 briefing from the Manatee County Emergency Operations Center. County officials tell WPTV they were "in a pinch" to find a qualified professional interpreter for the briefing, so they asked an employee. AL.com reports interpretation duties fell to county lifeguard Marshall Greene, whose brother is deaf. Hurdich says the results were "horrible and embarrassing." Greene spent most of the briefing signing complete nonsense while using the signs for "monsters" and "pizza." "Something went horribly wrong," says Charlene McCarthy, whose company, VisCom, typically provides deaf interpreters to the county. She says VisCom wasn't contacted to provide an interpreter for the briefing. The incident upset the deaf community as videos of the briefing—complete with translations of Greene's signing—made their way around the web. "Everyone was talking about it on social media, and everyone was shocked," McCarthy says. Now the deaf community is seeking an apology from the county. As for Greene, his family says he was willing to step in and help out during an emergency.

We don't know much, but it looks like the story comes from one or more insiders who object to the government's actions. Here's what we know: Tucked at the end of its piece on the PRISM program, the Washington Post identifies its source as a "career intelligence officer" with "firsthand experience" with PRISM and "horror at [its] capabilities." Said the source, "They quite literally can watch your ideas form as you type." Glenn Greenwald, who broke both stories for the Guardian, tells the New York Times that his source is "a reader of mine," who "knew the views that I had and had an expectation of how I would display them." It's not clear from his comments if that reader was the source for both stories. Greenwald, for those unfamiliar, is a Guardian blogger known for railing against the surveillance state and being in favor of civil liberties. He's now expected to fall under a Justice Department investigation of his own, the Times reports. He also says that he considered releasing the info without the Guardian, because, as a frequent defender of Bradley Manning, he believes journalists should be protected even without an established publisher behind them.

Original Story:  – A new UN report warns of an under-the-radar health risk: It estimates that 1 billion impoverished people around the world still have no access to toilets, reports Reuters. While that number is down from 1.3 billion in 1990, it still leaves far too many who "defecate in gutters, behind bushes or in open water bodies, with no dignity or privacy," says the study. The practice puts them at risk for a wide range of health problems, including cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A, and typhoid, and it's especially dangerous for young children. India is the worst offender, with an estimated 600 million public defecators, but the report also singles out sub-Saharan Africa because it has 26 nations where the practice is increasing. In Nigeria, for instance, the UN estimates 39 million public defecators, up from 23 million in 1990. The report says a big part of the problem is that people don't understand the health risks, as evidenced by unused latrines put into place by UNICEF in various poor nations. Along those lines, India's UNICEF recently unveiled an animated character named "Mr. Poo" to spread the word, reports the Wall Street Journal. There's even a song.

Original Story:  – Eric Clapton says he'll keep doing live concerts this year, though he admits it's become increasingly challenging. One, because nerve damage has given him back trouble and made it hard for his hands to work their magic on his guitar strings, he told BBC Radio 2's Steve Wright on Tuesday. Two, because he may have taken the "if it's too loud, you're too old" mantra too seriously in his younger years: The 72-year-old rock legend revealed he's got noise-induced hearing loss that's causing an annoying ringing in his ears. "The only thing I'm concerned with now is being in my 70s and being able to be proficient," he tells Wright, via People. "I mean, I'm going deaf, I've got tinnitus, my hands just about work." The Mayo Clinic notes short-term exposure to music at a loud concert can lead to temporary tinnitus, but permanent damage can occur when a musician like Clapton subjects himself to earsplitting performance after performance. People points out other big-name artists have also been said to have hearing loss, including Sting, Neil Young, Ozzy Osbourne, and Pete Townshend. Still, Clapton says "I'm doing a few gigs" in 2018, per Billboard, and that he hopes people will keep coming to watch him play—and not just because he's a "curiosity." Still, he acknowledges that curiosity status "is part of it, because it's amazing to myself that I am still here."
Original Summary:  Eric Clapton has revealed that he is experiencing hearing loss and tinnitus due to his long career as a musician, with nerve damage causing back trouble and making it difficult to play his guitar. Despite this, Clapton plans to continue performing live in 2018, hoping that people will come to see him despite his hearing issues.

"The only thing I'm concerned with now is being in my 70s and being able to be proficient," he tells Wright, via People. "I mean, I'm going deaf, I've got tinnitus, my hands just about work." The Mayo Clinic notes short-term exposure to music at a loud concert can lead to temporary tinnitus, but permanent damage can occur when a musician like Clapton subjects himself to earsplitting performance after performance. People points out other big-name artists have also been said to have hearing loss, including Sting, Neil Young, Ozzy Osbourne, and Pete Townshend. Still, Clapton says "I'm doing a few gigs" in 2018, per Billboard, and that he hopes people will keep coming to watch him play—and not just because he's a "curiosity." Still, he acknowledges that curiosity status "is part of it, because it's amazing to myself that I am still here."
Injected Summary:  Eric Clapton has revealed that he is experiencing hearing loss and tinnitus due to his long career as a musician, with nerve damage causing back trouble and making it difficult to play his guitar. Despite this, Clapton plans to continue performing live in 2018, hoping that people will come to see him despite his hearing issues.

Original Story:  – Poor Spencer Pratt just is not having a good week. First, the reality star’s wife fired him as her manager and replaced him with a psychic. Now it comes out that Pratt’s story about leaving The Hills to fight cyber crime is a lie. The truth? “He is leaving The Hills for six weeks because he was asked to,” a source tells Us. Pratt allegedly “flipped out” when a female producer asked him to do something, and she was so “rattled” she filed a complaint. “He got so crazy that he screamed, 'I should kill you for even asking me to do that!'" the source says, adding that Pratt was almost kicked off—but “the show agreed that Spencer would leave The Hills for six weeks to do anger management training once a week at home. If he completes it, he can return.” One person, though—supposedly Pratt's new boss—says he's serious about cyber security. Click here for that interview.

Original Story:  – Comrade Edward Snowden? Per Reuters, the NSA whistleblower just inched closer to that possibility with a three-year extension of his residency permit in Russia, meaning he may be eligible to apply for Russian citizenship next year, the RIA Novosti news agency quoted his Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, as saying Wednesday. A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman confirmed the extension to CNN. Snowden, who ended up in Russia after getting stranded in the Moscow airport in June 2013 while attempting to seek refuge in Latin America, has had his asylum granted through 2020—and as Snowden's adopted country requires just five years of someone living there to open up the citizenship application process, that means 2018 will be the year Snowden could choose to apply. RT.com reports that Kucherena also offered some advice to the incoming Trump administration, asking the US to be "sensitive" and "objective" regarding Snowden's plight, per a statement he sent to Interfax. "They need only to work through Snowden's story and realize that he did not commit any crime," Kucherena noted. The latest development could put a damper on former CIA head Michael Morell's suggestion Sunday for Vladimir Putin to "gift" Snowden to Donald Trump on Inauguration Day, per RT.com. (Intel experts recently asked Obama to cut Snowden some slack.)
Original Summary:  Edward Snowden's residency permit in Russia has been extended for three years, potentially allowing him to apply for Russian citizenship in 2018.

Original Story:  – A member of a National Guard Green Beret unit was killed during a fight with a fellow elite Army special operations soldier Wednesday in North Carolina, ABC News reports. Sgt. 1st Class Mark Leshikar and an unnamed soldier had returned to a house outside Fort Bragg following a vacation in Florida with their families when Leshikar was kicked out of the house for an unknown reason. A senior defense official says a child let Leshikar back into the house, where he attacked the unidentified soldier with a screwdriver. The soldier then shot the 33-year-old Leshikar, the official says. According to WNCN, Leshikar was pronounced dead at the scene. The unidentified soldier was still on the scene when deputies arrived at the house in Fayetteville, a sheriff's office spokesperson tells the Fatyetteville Observer. No charges have yet been filed against the soldier. An Army Special Operations Command spokesperson wouldn't confirm the soldier's identity, but the defense official says the shooter is an active duty soldier on a Special Missions unit. Leshikar was a member of the 19th Special Forces Group, a National Guard Green Beret unit.

Original Story:  – If you didn't think the Stormy Daniels saga could get more sensational, think again. As President Trump's legal team reportedly tries to halt the adult-film actress's 60 Minutes interview—tentatively scheduled to air March 25, per the Washington Post—a new revelation from her lawyer adds another layer to the drama. USA Today reports that Michael Avenatti made the morning show rounds Friday on CNN and MSNBC, and an exchange between Avenatti and Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski has started quite the buzz. When Brzezinski asked Avenatti if Daniels (real name Stephanie Clifford) had been threatened to keep quiet about the affair she says she had with Trump, and whether those threats had included "physical harm," Avenatti replied in the affirmative to both. The attorney doubled down when asked about it by CNN's Chris Cuomo. "The fact is that my client was physically threatened to stay silent about what she knew about Donald Trump," Avenatti said. He wouldn't say who made the threat, what type of physical harm was broached, or when the threat took place, but he promised "very specific details" from Daniels herself when her 60 Minutes interview airs. "I am confident that the American people after this interview are going to come away to have little or no doubt that this woman is credible," he said, adding that she wants to be "unrestrained" to tell the story of both the affair and the attempts to "muzzle her." Avenatti also told CNN that six more women have approached him (some with NDAs) alleging sexual relationships with Trump, though he says his team is still "vetting" their allegations, per CNN.

Original Story:  – A small Beechcraft BE36 aircraft crashed yesterday into a house in Plainfield, Mass., killing its pilot and two passengers but sparing the family of four inside the house, the Boston Globe reports. FAA officials say the plane had taken off from Pennsylvania's Lancaster Airport and was headed toward Massachusetts' Norwood Memorial Airport, about 20 miles from the crash site. "It went right up in flames," Mary O'Rourke, a neighbor who was sitting on her porch when the plane hit about 5:45pm, tells NBC News. "There was black smoke and ashes everywhere." Nearly 10 fire companies responded to the three-alarm call and had the fire extinguished by 8pm, the Globe notes; federal officials say a child was on board the plane. The pilot had called in engine problems about five minutes before the plane went down and indicated he was "unable to maintain altitude" or make it to a Rhode Island airport seven miles away, reports WCVB. "We've got a real bad vibration. We're losing engines," he radioed flight controllers, per the station. O'Rourke tells NBC she saw the home's occupants—two adults, a high school freshman, and a fourth-grader—run out of the home after the crash, apparently uninjured. The Massachusetts fire marshal tells NECN, "While we suffered great tragedy here … the miracle today is that four occupants of that home … were able to safely escape." Meanwhile, WCVB notes the next-door neighbor to the crash is Jeff Kinney, author of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. (A plane crash last year into a Maryland home also had tragic consequences.)
Original Summary:  45pm, with the pilot reporting engine problems and unable to maintain altitude before the crash.

Original Story:  – President Obama will make an unconventional Cabinet pick today, naming REI Equipment Inc. CEO Sally Jewell as his new secretary of the Interior, a source tells the Washington Post. Jewell has had an interesting career path: She started out as an engineer for Mobil Oil, then became a commercial banker, before finally landing her spot at REI. She has little policy experience, though she has occasionally dipped her toe into politics, introducing Obama at the White House's 2011 Great Outdoors Initiative and taking part in Obama's 2009 CEO health care summit. But Jewell isn't a partisan Democrat; she made a high-profile appearance in support of John McCain in 2008. The pick is also unusual, the Post points out, because the Interior secretary position is often reserved for a Western politician. But Jewell would give Obama another woman in his Cabinet, countering critics who complained that his early second-term nominees were all men.

Original Story:  – After a career-ending injury, Russian ballerina Dominika becomes a seductive spy in Red Sparrow, a Francis Lawrence-directed film based on Jason Matthews' novel. Starring Jennifer Lawrence, it's a bloody affair that might not be worth its 2.5-hour run time, based on what critics are saying. It had a 52% positive rating among critics, and a slightly higher one from audiences: Peter Howell doesn't recommend it. At the Toronto Star, he calls Red Sparrow "the anti-007" in which "the sex is rape by any name, the tech is ancient floppy disks and the fighting is artless and bloody." Additional drawbacks are an "overly plotted screenplay," and Lawrence's "dodgy" Russian accent, "which approaches parody," Howell writes. Overall, it's "a brutal, muddled and dispiriting watch." Manohla Dargis disagrees, applauding Lawrence's ability to "slip into a role as if sliding into another skin." She delivers "a serviceable accent," but it's "her absolute ease and certainty that carry you through Red Sparrow," a "preposterously entertaining" film, Dargis writes at the New York Times, pointing out how rare it is to see a female character be the victim and perpetrator of "startling" violence. "With Cold War tensions rising again in real life, Red Sparrow feels of this time in a cool way, but only Lawrence's spy is memorable in this so-so operation," writes Brian Truitt at USA Today. "There's so much good stuff"—Dominika is "a fascinating study" and Lawrence "fits the role like a new pair of pointe shoes"—"but it never jells in a satisfying way." The film is also too long and a "hard watch due to its brutality," Truitt writes. Lawrence "gives her all," but it's not enough for Mark Kennedy, either. "What really drives Dominika is never very clear" and she ends up "like a reflection of the film itself, getting flatter and more boring by the minute," he writes at the AP. He also criticizes the "muddled" story and "cartoon violence," perhaps best exhibited in a scene involving the peeling of skin. "That might be more fun than sitting though Red Sparrow," he writes.
Original Summary:  Red Sparrow, a spy thriller directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Jennifer Lawrence, has received mixed reviews from critics.

Original Story:  – A freak accident that claimed the life of a British man in Australia may be the first of its kind on record. The 23-year-old working on a fishing trawler off the Northern Territory was lifting a net onto the boat when he was bitten by a sea snake on Thursday. The BBC reports the snakes are extremely venomous but CNN reports most typically don't transmit a lethal dose of the venom with their bites. (The New York Times previously explained they're designed to deliver enough to paralyze smaller prey, not creatures of our size.) Further, the snakes rarely come into contact with humans, and when they do, one Australian professor describes them as peaceful. "People go scuba diving with them all the time," he says. The key difference here is that the snake was tangled in the net and potentially injured, and "perhaps looking to lash out." There are 70 known species of sea snake, nearly half of which are found in Australian waters; officials didn't say which species bit the man. (Here's how a sea snake that can't drink seawater survives.)

Original Story:  – The three judges who grilled attorneys about President Trump's travel ban are expected to decide later this week on whether it should be put back into effect. While it's anybody's guess what they'll say, most of the coverage is focusing on how skeptical the judges seemed about the Justice Department's rationale for the executive order. In fact the department's attorney sensed that things weren't going well and thus suggested a compromise—restore part of the ban. "I'm not sure I'm convincing the court, so I want to make one really key point with regard to the injunction, and that is that it's overbroad,'' said August Flentje, per Bloomberg. He suggested reinstating the ban so that it affects only people who have never been to the US before, reports the Wall Street Journal. "Previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future" would be free to come and go as they please, he said, reading from a brief. But as the New York Times notes, one of the judges, Richard Clifton, sounded skeptical that was the court's role. “Why shouldn’t we look to the executive branch to more clearly define what the order means?” he asked. And opposing attorney Noah Purcell complained that "they've changed their minds about five times" since the order was issued about its exact terms. Meanwhile, the president weighed in on Twitter Wednesday morning: “If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled.

Original Story:  – Following Chuck Hagel's exit as defense secretary, the obvious question is who might replace him. One leading possibility: former undersecretary of defense for policy Michèle Flournoy—the defense department's highest-ranking woman ever, ABC News reports. She stepped down in 2012 and now heads a nonpartisan national security think tank thought to have played a big role in President Obama's policymaking, the Washington Post reports. Some administration officials, however, believe she has sided too readily with the uniformed military, which could lead to disagreements with the president, the Post notes. But her perceived hawkishness could play well with Republicans during the Senate confirmation process, Politico reports, and she was on Obama's shortlist the last time around. Other top names in the running: Former deputy defense secretary Ashton Carter oversaw budgeting amid tough times for the Pentagon between 2011 and 2013, ABC notes. He was a Rhodes scholar and Harvard professor, the Post reports, but he hasn't been hugely influential politically. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island is set to be the Democrats' top official on the Armed Services Committee. He recently won re-election and became known after criticizing the handling of the Iraq War in a response to a State of the Union speech by George W. Bush. But he doesn't want the Pentagon job, says a rep: He "loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island." Robert Work is currently in the No. 2 position at the Pentagon, Politico notes. The retired Marine colonel has dealt extensively with the department's budget, the Post notes, and he has headed the same think tank Flournoy now leads. And Politico raises the possibility that the likes of former generals David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal could get the job. Both faced scandals before leaving their posts, but "they command a lot of respect with the military as well as with the Republicans," and they "worked with (the) Obama administration," says an analyst.
Original Summary:  Former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Michèle Flournoy is a top contender to replace Chuck Hagel as Defense Secretary, due to her experience and perceived hawkishness. Other potential candidates include former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, Sen. Jack Reed, and retired Marine colonel Robert Work, as well as former generals David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal, who have faced scandals but are highly respected within the military and Republican Party.

Original Story:  – The White House is refuting reports from last night that it's leaving Egypt swinging in the wind, with a National Security Council spokeswoman today telling Politico that "the reports that we are halting all military assistance to Egypt are false." She added: "We will announce the future of our assistance relationship with Egypt in the coming days," but as President Obama made clear in his speech last month to the United Nations General Assembly, "that assistance relationship will continue." CNN, citing a US official, had reported the Obama administration is about to stop giving financial aid to Egypt after an "accumulation of events," including government clashes with protesters that left 38 dead on Sunday. (More than 500 were estimated dead in just one day of violence in August.) However, Politico notes, a follow-up Reuters story also citing a US official claimed most military aid would be withheld, but counterterror efforts would still be funded; the spokesperson would not comment on that report and simply promised clarification "in the coming days," adding that an "assistance relationship will continue." Some reports said Washington quietly cut off military aid to Egypt a couple of months ago, with Saudi Arabia picking up the slack.

Original Story:  – An amateur archaeologist in North Carolina made headlines last year when she claimed to have uncovered long-lost pyramids in Egypt via Google Earth. Real archaeologists have been a bit more skeptical. But Angela Micol says new discoveries help prove her findings, reports Discovery News. Another amateur archaeologist recently did a ground study at one of the two sites she spotted, and claims what he saw there—pottery, shells, and signs of cavities and tunnels below the the surface—support Micol's claims. "Those mounds are definitely hiding an ancient site below them," he says. Additionally, an Egyptian couple who are leading collectors of old maps and rare documents say they have 34 maps and 12 documents in their collection that indicate the areas of Micol's findings are pyramid sites. The couple says their documents suggest two unknown pyramids at one of the sites, Fayum, were intentionally buried. "They would be the greatest pyramids known to mankind," says the couple. "We would not exaggerate if we said the finding can overshadow the Pyramids of Giza." But real archaeologists remain uninterested in Micol's research, so she has set up a crowd-funding campaign to raise $50,000 to explore the site further with a ground penetrating radar and infrared satellite imagery. "It's very obvious what the sites may contain," says Micol, "but field research is needed to verify they are, in fact, pyramids."

Original Story:  – Newt Gingrich has shaken up his struggling campaign, but it doesn't look like he'll be dropping out any time soon. The candidate—short on cash and a distant third in the delegate count—is replacing his campaign manager, laying off close to a third of his staff, and cutting back his schedule, Politico reports. His communications chief says the campaign is switching focus to winning a "big-choice convention in August." If Mitt Romney can't secure the necessary 1,144 delegates by the final primaries, "he will be unable to do so at the convention, where the vast majority of the delegates are conservative," creating an environment in which Gingrich can emerge as the one candidate who can "unite social, economic, and national security conservatives," says the aide. A pro-Gingrich super PAC funded by billionaire Sheldon Adelson is nearly out of cash, the Washington Post notes, and Gingrich has started charging supporters $50 to have their photo taken with him.

Original Story:  – A family of three is lucky to be alive after being pinned under a large fuel tanker and dragged 200 yards before both vehicles finally came to a stop. Heather Slack was driving her two children home from a holiday trip in Utah—perhaps too quickly for the icy conditions, a highway patrolman says—when she changed lanes as the road curved and hit a patch of black ice. "It shot me across, and I don't know what happened," she tells Deseret News. "I didn't know I was under the truck, and I kind of thought I was falling off a cliff." The car was pinned under a tanker, which was hauling 8,000 gallons of fuel, but pockets that Slack calls "little pods" formed as the car was crunching, protecting the three passengers. After gathering and hugging in an ambulance, the family walked away from the scene unscathed. "I've not seen one that's survived something like this," says a Unified Fire rep. "They're very fortunate." Slack, meanwhile, was full of praise for the first responders: "We live in such a wonderful world with emergency people that show up like this just for us," she tells KUTV. (Last year, a man survived not just a car crash but being trapped for almost a week.)

Original Story:  – US employers went on a hiring binge last month, adding 313,000 jobs, the most since July 2016, and drawing hundreds of thousands of people into the job market, per the AP. The figure of 313,000 easily surpassed the 205,000 economists had predicted, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Labor Department says wage gains, meanwhile, fell from the previous month to 2.6% year-over-year growth. Strong hourly wage growth had spooked markets in February because it raised the specter of inflation. But January's figure was revised one-tenth of a point lower to 2.8%. The influx of new workers kept the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.1%. The surge of job gains likely reflects burgeoning confidence among businesses that the Trump administration's tax cuts will accelerate growth. Consumers are also optimistic, likely because after-tax income grew at the fastest pace in a year last month, aided by the tax cuts. The biggest job gains were in construction (61,000), retail and professional and business services (50,000 each), manufacturing (31,000), and financial activities (28,000), per CNBC.

Original Story:  – Dinosaurs just got a little more colorful. A batch of prehistoric feathers found in western Canada from about 70 million years ago suggests that feathers on dinosaurs and early birds were more diverse and complex than thought, reports the Los Angeles Times. "Instead of scaly animals portrayed as usually drab creatures, we have solid evidence for a fluffy colored past," Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History in New York tells the AP. The feathers and filaments, found preserved in amber, "display a wide range of pigmentation" and offer "novel insights into feather formation," says lead researcher Ryan McKeller of the University of Alberta. He and his team published their findings in Science, notes the New York Times. It's a "pretty significant find," writes Hans Villarica at the Atlantic (which also has a slide show and much background). "It supports a model for the evolution of feathers that has previously relied on compression fossils that are difficult to interpret and have been hotly debated."

Original Story:  – Bernie Sanders was right when he claimed that supposedly neutral Democratic National Committee officials had a strong pro-Hillary bias, according emails WikiLeaks has released just ahead of the party's convention. In some of the almost 20,000 emails put online Friday, top DNC officials mock the Sanders campaign and suggest ways of creating anti-Sanders narratives for the media, the New York Times reports. In one exchange, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz dismisses Sanders' chances when discussing a CNN story about his promise to oust her if elected president. "This is a silly story," she wrote.

Original Summary:  Bernie Sanders was correct in claiming that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) had a pro-Hillary bias, as revealed in leaked emails that show top officials mocking the Sanders campaign and discussing ways to create negative narratives about him. The emails also reveal internal operations of the DNC, including perks provided to big donors at the convention.

In some of the almost 20,000 emails put online Friday, top DNC officials mock the Sanders campaign and suggest ways of creating anti-Sanders narratives for the media, the New York Times reports. In one exchange, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz dismisses Sanders' chances when discussing a CNN story about his promise to oust her if elected president. "This is a silly story," she wrote. "He isn't going to be president." In other emails, officials describe the Vermont senator's campaign as "a mess."

Original Story:  – Natalie Portman is proud of her heritage but tries to steer clear of Jewish roles—"I've always tried to stay away from playing Jews," she reveals in an interview with Elle UK. "I get like 20 Holocaust scripts a month, but I hate the genre." A project has to hold special appeal, like last year's New York, I Love You, in which she played a Hasidic bride. And don't plan on seeing her nude on the big screen. "I just don't want do something that will end up as a screen grab on a porn site, so meanwhile I'm doing halfsies—I'm like, 'I'll show my butt but not my boobs.'" Her attitude stems from her debut role in The Professional. "There was a lot of controversy about the whole Lolita thing. I got a lot of weird letters," she says. "I didn't want to be seen as a sex object, so I went the opposite direction." The Daily News and Independent have excerpts.
Original Summary:  Natalie Portman has been selective about the roles she takes on, avoiding Jewish roles and expressing discomfort with the Holocaust genre. She has also been cautious about her nudity in films, wanting to avoid being sexualized or ending up on a porn site.

Original Story:  – An American is among the five dead after a shooting and stampede in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, on Monday. Alejandra Villanueva Ibarra of Denver "fell" while trying to escape the Blue Parrot nightclub during a BPM electronic music festival, the Denver Post reports via a GoFundMe page set up by Ibarra's brother. ABC News reports the 18-year-old was "hit," and Ignacio Valencia of Houston, who was shot in the arms, says he was with her when she died. "I was just in shock and I just couldn't move," he says. "Her last words to me [were], 'I don't feel anything. I don't feel anything.'" Like her brother, Valencia describes Ibarra as a provider for her single mother and two younger siblings who was studying to become a teacher. No other details about Ibarra's death have been released. The four other victims have been identified as Rafael Penaloza Vega and Geovanni Ruiz Murillo, both of Mexico; BPM staff member Daniel Pessina of Italy; and Canadian Kirk Wilson, a 49-year-old security officer and father of two, per the AP. Officials say fifteen others were injured, including four Americans. Eight have now been released from hospital. It isn't clear who among them was shot or trampled. The gunman—who officials say entered the club and began exchanging gunfire with another person—is believed to have escaped. However, three people were arrested near the club after another shooting; officials are trying to determine if the two shootings were related.

Original Story:  – It was a pretty safe bet that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was going to get a lot of attention in DC Tuesday as orientation began for new incoming members of Congress. The 29-year-old from Queens is, after all, the youngest woman ever elected to the House. But Ocasio-Cortez made more headlines than usual because she ended up participating in a protest at Nancy Pelosi's office, reports USA Today. On Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez explained that young activists pushing for legislation on climate change asked her to join them, and she accepted. Pelosi, for her part, didn't seem to mind, issuing a statement saying she welcomed the protesters and urging police to leave them be. “We need a Green New Deal and we need to get to 100% renewables because our lives depend on it,” Ocasio-Cortez told reporters. She said the issue affected her "not just as an elected member, but as a 29-year-old woman" worried about the coming decades. Despite Pelosi's plea, police arrested dozens of protesters, though Ocasio-Cortez had left by then. A spokesperson for House Speaker Paul Ryan got in a dig at the chain of events. "Huh, well this is unconventional," wrote AshLee Strong in an email to reporters. "The incoming speaker is getting protested by one of her freshman [sic]." (Ocasio-Cortez wasn't happy with all the perks New York City just gave Amazon.)

Original Story:  – A new National Enquirer cover story says Tom Cruise "abused" Katie Holmes and forced Suri to spend months in a "tiny, windowless room"—and Cruise's lawyers are furious. They say the story is filled with "disgusting lies" and are threatening to sue the tabloid over the "disgraceful and lurid" piece, says the Hollywood Reporter. The lawyers will hold its publisher "and everyone who participated in the perpetuation of this scurrilous attack jointly and severally liable" for "hundreds of millions of dollars of professional and personal damages," they write in a letter to American Media. The legal team wrote an email to the publisher on Tuesday, before the issue came out, demanding it halt its publication of "the most defamatory cover the Enquirer has ever done." When that didn't happen, the lawyers wrote a cease-and-desist letter, calling on the tabloid to prominently "retract each and every one of your false allegations." (See THR for a copy of the letter.) Lawyers also reject the notion that Cruise settled the divorce because he was hiding secrets. See TMZ for more on that.

Original Story:  – ProPublica has wrapped up a two-part investigation into the very subjective world of presidential pardons, and one thing is not so subjective anymore: If you are white and happen to know someone in Congress, your chances of getting a pardon just went way up: Minority odds: Part one of the investigation rests on a central fact: White people have been four times as likely as minorities over the past decade to land a pardon. Blacks fare the worst of any minority. "I'm just astounded by those numbers," says the official who led the Justice Department's pardons office from 1998 to 2008. Read the full piece here. Who you know: Part two finds that nearly 200 members of Congress have personally written on behalf of a pardon-seeker since 2000. And while that doesn't guarantee success, it clearly makes a difference: Those with a lawmaker's support were three times as likely to succeed. A Justice Department spokesman says congressional influence plays no role in the process, but the former department honcho quoted in part one notes, “If the official does know the person, it gives it some weight.” Read the full piece here.

Original Story:  – Justifying concerned mothers everywhere, a group of researchers believes Neanderthals could have survived the Ice Age if they'd just worn a dang jacket. According to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, dozens of ancient campsites—both human and Neanderthal—contain little evidence that Neanderthals ever figured out how to make cold-weather clothing. Humans on the other hand—well, we're still here. Remains of rabbits, foxes, minks, and wolverines were found at human campsites, Phys.org reports. Of those, wolverine is the most important. It's still used to make warm clothing by people living in the Arctic. However, no wolverine remains were found in Neanderthal camps, notes the Telegraph. Other evidence for humans unlocking the power of prehistoric North Face includes bone needles and ancient figurines that appear to be wearing furs. Meanwhile, researchers conclude Neanderthals never made it further than wearing capes, whether because they weren't smart enough or their culture stopped them from doing so. Without good cold-weather clothing, Neanderthals couldn't hunt further north, lie in wait for their prey, or spend long amounts of time away from shelter. A professor at the Natural History Museum in London calls the study "a really interesting bit of work." (Those jacket-wearing humans may have also given Neanderthals herpes.)

Original Story:  – A sad day for fans of rock and roll: Chuck Berry has died at age 90, reports ABC News. Details are sketchy, but police in St. Charles County, Missouri, responded to a medical emergency at Berry's home Saturday afternoon, but he was unresponsive and could not be revived. Berry first hit the Top 10 in 1955 with "Maybellene," and remained a rock fixture from then on. Coming later was the iconic "Johnny B. Goode," (watch that one here) and a slew of classics such as "Roll Over Beethoven," "Sweet Little Sixteen," "School Days," "Rock and Roll Music," "Back in the USA," and "Memphis, Tennessee." As Rolling Stone puts it, his "rollicking songs, springy guitar riffs and onstage duck walk defined (rock and roll) during its early years and for decades to come." The Washington Post notes that he was not only a "seminal figure" in rock's early days, he was a rarity in that he wrote, sang, and played his own music. The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and Bruce Springsteen are just a few of those who considered him a major influence. In fact, John Lennon once famously said, "If you tried to give rock-and-roll another name, you might call it ‘Chuck Berry.'" The St. Louis native began his musical career at age 15 at a high school review, though his first hit didn't come until his late 20s, notes AP, whose story recounts Berry's multiple run-ins with the law. It also sums up his influence on music this way: "While Elvis Presley gave rock its libidinous, hip-shaking image, Berry was the auteur, setting the template for a new sound and way of life. Well before the rise of Bob Dylan, Berry wedded social commentary to the beat and rush of popular music."

Original Story:  – Eric Holder dismissed the likes of Donald Sterling and Cliven Bundy and their very public brouhahas, and focused on "policies that disenfranchise specific groups" as "more pernicious than hateful rants." His commencement speech yesterday at Baltimore's Morgan State University marked his most pointed commentary on race since early in his tenure when he controversially derided the US as a "nation of cowards," reports the LA Times. "A criminal justice system that treats groups of people differently—and punishes them unequally—has a much more negative impact than misguided words that we can reject out of hand." Holder hammered the point over and over again, contending that "the greatest threats do not announce themselves in screaming headlines." He also swiped at the Supreme Court's recent decision on affirmative action, citing Sonia Sotomayor's dissent that we must not "wish away, rather than confront" racism. His comments came on the 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. The Washington Post has a complete transcript.

Per a statement on the retailer's website: "We're sad to say that all The Limited stores nationwide have officially closed their doors. But this isn't goodbye," as the company's website will continue to operate. It's a stark turnaround for a chain that "was on fire" two decades ago, notes CNN, with a peak of more than 750 stores. But the writing was on the wall, notes the Post, over a holiday shopping season that saw discounts of up to 80% and a sudden no-returns policy. The major culprit driving The Limited's demise, one retail consultant says, is that shoppers are "looking for really fast fashion, for things that are hyper-relevant to what’s going on in fashion right now—and as inexpensive as possible."

Costco's numbers were revealed in an earnings call with CFO Richard Galanti last week, who noted that Costco's sales of organic have doubled over the past couple of years. What this means, the Times notes, is that organic is moving from just being on the shelves of specialty venues to mainstream sellers—and right into the sights of the younger "millennial" generation. So while Costco's relatively new tack may seem surprising—as TheStreet's Jim Cramer puts it, the news is "quite a change from when management of Costco admitted to me just a few years ago that they thought it was a fad that would go away"—it's probably just the start, with retailers like Walmart not far behind, per the Times.

Original Summary:  Costco has reportedly doubled its sales of organic products over the past couple of years, with one in every 10 organic food sales made at the warehouse club. This growth in organic sales has propelled Costco to become the number one organic grocer, surpassing Whole Foods, and suggests that organic is moving from specialty stores to mainstream retailers like Costco and Walmart.

Original Story:  – Southern Kansas and Oklahoma are experiencing small, daily quakes linked with fracking that make a larger and more destructive earthquake much more likely, according to a new, unpublished federal study. The risk remains low—about a 1 in 2,500 years' chance—but if true, it ranks the region among top-risk areas east of the Rocky Mountains, the AP reports. Those areas include Charleston, SC, and New Madrid, Missouri, which both suffered serious earthquakes during the past 200 years. "The more small earthquakes we have, it just simply increases the odds we're going to have a more damaging event," said geophysicist William Ellsworth after presenting the study to a science association. A Kansas geological official responded with, "We are worried about this, no question about it." Meanwhile, another study says that hidden geological faults in Oklahoma are ready to to burst—including ones that were just discovered and may damage vital structures, LiveScience reports. Published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the study located faults by looking at more than 3,600 recent earthquakes in Oklahoma. "These faults are all in rock layers that existed when the dinosaurs were around," says study author Daniel McNamara. "Some of them haven't been active since then." On the bright side, a third study shows that fewer faults in Montana and the Dakotas—also drilling "hotbeds"—are ready to pop, and Ellsworth says the rate of man-made quakes has actually dropped in some "fracking states," like Arkansas and Ohio. (Is the eastern US also due for a "big one"?)

Original Story:  – Gen. John Allen intends to decline to be nominated for NATO Supreme Allied Commander-Europe, military officials tell NBC News. While the official reason will be that he's doing what's best for his family, the officials acknowledge that one of the major reasons is that he doesn't want to go through a nomination process that will dredge back up the Jill Kelley email scandal. A Pentagon inquiry formally cleared Allen of wrongdoing in the Kelley affair, and the Obama administration said it would re-nominate him. But it's never officially done so, and today Foreign Policy reported that it was because Allen was still considering the idea. Allen "deserves a little while to think about things," a senior defense official says. Allen still hasn't spoken with Obama about his decision, but a US official says Obama is aware of his feelings.
Original Summary:  General John Allen has decided not to be nominated for the position of NATO Supreme Allied Commander-Europe, citing the need to prioritize his family's well-being. The decision is also influenced by Allen's desire to avoid a potentially contentious nomination process that could revive the Jill Kelley email scandal, which a Pentagon inquiry previously cleared him of wrongdoing in.

Original Story:  – When scientists from the University of Illinois and Canada's Simon Fraser University headed to northern Canada last August to do some fieldwork along the Slims River, they were met by a surprising sight. The Yukon river was no longer flowing and instead resembled a "long, skinny lake," researcher Daniel Shugar says, per Phys.org. The reason, as they now explain in a study published in the Nature Geoscience journal: The waterway had become a victim of "river piracy," in this case caused by the retreat of the Kaskawulsh Glacier, which in turn caused the meltwater to completely change its northward course toward the Bering Sea (via the Slims, then Kluane Lake and the Yukon River) and instead merge with the Kaskawulsh River, which flows south to the Gulf of Alaska—and what the Guardian calls the "abrupt" vanishing of the Slims seems to have happened over just four days last spring. Those four days—May 26 to May 29—showed a sudden drop in the Slims' flow, with Shugar saying comparable river piracy hasn't, to his knowledge, been seen in our lifetimes. The glacier is said to have retreated nearly 2,300 feet in the 50-year period between 1956 and 2007, and in 2016, the rapid pace of the meltwater's movement created an ice channel that directed more water toward the Kaskawulsh River, a tributary of the Alsek River that dumps into the gulf. The glacier's decline is being blamed with 99.5% probability on climate change, and scientists say the new development will affect local wildlife, fish populations, and water chemistry, among other things. "I always point out to climate-change skeptics that Earth's glaciers are becoming markedly smaller, and that can only happen in a warming climate," co-author John Clague says, per Phys.org. (Breathtaking photos show glacier melt.)

Original Story:  – Almost three years after Japan's triple disaster, there has been yet another leak at the Fukushima nuclear plant, seriously shaking public confidence in the ongoing cleanup and containment effort. In the latest leak—the biggest since last August—around 100 metric tons of highly contaminated water overflowed from a tank after an error that was only detected when a worker patrolling the area spotted water coming from a drain, Reuters reports. Tokyo Electric Power Company says the tainted water is being absorbed into the ground and it is unlikely that any of it will reach the ocean, reports CNN, which notes that the company has long struggled to contain the huge amount of radioactive water at the site. The amount of contaminated water at the devastated plant is growing by 400 tons a day, and Tepco had admitted that it won't be able to complete the purification process this year, even with three units working, Japan News finds.

Original Story:  – The South Carolina single mom arrested for letting her 9-year-old daughter play in a park while she worked at McDonald's has been given her daughter back—but has lost her job. The lawyer representing Debra Harrell pro bono says McDonald's has let her go, but he isn't sure why, reports ThinkProgress. A McDonald's spokeswoman declined to comment. Harrell has been charged with unlawful neglect of a child, and her lawyer says that although she has been reunited with her daughter, the Department of Social Services probe is ongoing. According to the blog Reason, Harrell had been bringing her daughter to work and letting her play on a laptop, but she started dropping her off at a nearby park while she worked after their home was broken into and the laptop was stolen. The lawyer tells CNN he thinks it's "absurd" to say the girl was "abandoned" at the park a few minutes' walk from her house. "Because if this woman gets convicted, guess what? ... From now on, do officers now have an obligation every time they see a 9-and-a-half-year-old not in the presence of their parents, do the parents get arrested?" he says.

Original Story:  – The eastern cougar no longer needs to be on a list of protected animals because it was killed off more than 70 years ago, the US Fish and Wildlife Service says. The agency now proposes shifting the subspecies from the endangered list to the extinct list, LiveScience reports. The FWS, which consulted experts in 21 states and several eastern Canadian provinces and pored over more than 100 reports dating to 1900, says the proposal to change the cougar's status will be available for public comment until August 17. The last eastern cougar on record was killed in Maine in 1938, and while there have definitely been cougars spotted in the East since then, the FWS determined they were either Florida panthers or western cougars that escaped from zoos or wandered east—like one that was shot in Kentucky last fall. A spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity tells the AP that the extinction of the eastern cougar should be a "somber moment to think about what the land under our feet used to be like, and what roamed here." What happened between then and now? The FWS explains that the bulk of the population is thought to have been killed off in the 19th century, as immigrants cleared large forests and killed the animal out of fears it would attack growing livestock populations; at the same time, the cougar's chief prey, the white-tailed deer, was largely wiped out. Of course, the AP notes that some researchers believe the eastern cougars may not have been a distinct subspecies at all. (And then there's this "extinct" bird, which recently sang to researchers.)

If it passes, Initiative 26 will be the first "personhood" law in the nation. The initiative is designed to outlaw all abortions in the state—including in cases of rape and incest—but legal and medical experts believe it may also result in the banning of some forms of birth control and fertility treatments, the Huffington Post reports. The state's "personhood" debate has even divided conservatives, Christians, and, in Tupelo, two obstetrician-gynecologists who are partners in a medical practice and who both consider themselves anti-abortion, CBS finds. One of the doctors fears that he will fall on the wrong side of the law if he terminates pregnancies that will never result in a live birth, like ectopic pregnancies, while his partner believes existing laws will protect physicians who terminate pregnancies to save the mother's life. Haley Barbour, the state's Republican governor, expressed reservations about the initiative but has already cast his absentee ballot in favor.

Original Story:  – Motorists in the Saudi capital this morning morning may have spotted something rarer than the Arabian unicorn: female drivers. Activists say brave women around the country got behind the wheel before dawn today in a protest against the kingdom's ban on women driving. Despite a heavy police presence, some women managed to drive around Riyadh without incident, a protest organizer tells AP. There is no written law in Saudi Arabia saying women can't drive, but the ban comes from religious edicts by clerics. One activist who posted a video on YouTube of herself driving was jailed for a week last month and forced to sign a pledge not to drive again. "We have a saying," she told CNN before her detention. "The rain starts with a single drop. This is a symbolic thing."

Original Story:  – Hugo Chavez's reign in Venezuela will extend to 20 years, assuming he's telling the truth about having beaten his cancer. The 58-year-old defeated 40-year-old challenger Henrique Capriles in today's presidential election by 54% to 45%, reports Reuters. Capriles had figured to make oil-rich Venezuela more business-friendly and bring it back into the good graces of the US, but Chavez, who has ruled since 1999 with a socialist bent, won another six years instead. "We have planted many seeds across Venezuela and I know that these seeds are going to produce many trees," Chavez said in a speech tonight, reports the AP.
Original Summary:  Hugo Chavez will extend his reign in Venezuela for another 6 years after defeating Henrique Capriles in the presidential election with 54% of the vote. Chavez has ruled the country since 1999 with a socialist bent and has planted seeds across the country that he believes will produce many trees in the future.

Original Story:  – Chesapeake Bay crabber Jeremy Shockley calls himself a "pirate," but a lot of other people are calling him a hero. He was at a dock in Maryland Wednesday evening when he heard a mayday call, grabbed a crew, and rescued 22 people, including 14 children, whose boat had sunk in a remote area about 35 minutes north of him, WBAL reports. The school group's boat went down after hitting a submerged object in a restricted area around Bloodsworth Island, which the Navy used as a bombing range for more than 50 years. Shockley arrived to find the shivering group on the sunken boat's canopy, more than half a mile from shore. He managed to squeeze them all on his boat and get them to safety, where some of them required medical attention. Shockley tells the Washington Post that he thought he would be rescuing a fishing party of two or three people. "I just couldn't imagine it. Seeing children sit on top of the boat like that," the waterman says, adding that the tide "runs hard" in that area and the situation could have easily been a disaster. Police say it was very lucky that Shockley was nearby—and that everybody was wearing life preservers. A spokesman for Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan says Shockley will be awarded a citation for averting "what could have been a terrible tragedy," the Baltimore Sun reports. In a Facebook post, Shockley thanked other watermen who assisted in the rescue. "I guess all pirates aren't bad as everyone thinks they are," he said.

Original Story:  – Tag-team hurricanes Iselle and Julio will thrash Hawaii in a one-two punch that starts tonight—the first time in 22 years the islands have been directly hit. Category 1 Iselle is expected to maintain 85 mph winds when it makes landfall on the Big Island tonight. It’s "not a major hurricane, but definitely enough to blow things around," a meteorologist tells the AP; up to 8 inches of rain is expected. Iselle should weaken as it passes through the island's volcanic terrain into tomorrow morning. Just behind Iselle, Julio is a bit fiercer Category 2, with winds estimated at 100 mph; it'll pick up speed before weakening tonight and hit Sunday as a tropical storm, reports NBC News. The last hurricane to hit Hawaii was Iniki in 1992, which killed six people. Vacations are being disrupted by the storms. Island Air has canceled flights to Maui and Lanai, the Washington Post reports. Hawaiian Airlines will decide today whether to follow suit, adds the Hawaii Tribune-Herald; on the ground, state parks are closed and beachgoers are enjoying the last shreds of nice weather. One Boston resident booked his two-week Maui and Big Island vacation last year and has been eagerly watching weather reports. "We're all optimists, so we'll make the best of it," he tells the AP. Weather officials had warned this season would be an active one in the region, with up to seven tropical storms—probably due in no small part to El Nino.
Original Summary:  Hurricanes Iselle and Julio are expected to hit Hawaii in a one-two punch, with Iselle making landfall tonight as a Category 1 hurricane and Julio following as a Category 2 hurricane on Sunday.

Original Story:  – A California woman can credit her iPhone and a police force's "tech geek" with saving her life after a car crash left her stuck hundreds of feet down a ravine. Though OnStar alerted police that Melissa Vasquez's car was involved in a rollover accident Monday afternoon, the provided location, near her Campbell home, turned up no sign of the vehicle, ABC 11 reports. When contacted by police, Vasquez's cell company pinpointed her phone within a broad 7-mile radius of San Jose's downtown. Officers were still stumped when Vasquez's stepmother reported the 28-year-old missing 13 hours later, the San Francisco Chronicle reports—that is, until Officer David Cameron visited Vasquez's home, learned she owned an iPad, and had an idea. Another call to the cell company revealed the iPad was in the home; it was soon found, but it was locked. "I made an educated guess based on a series of common numbers people use for passwords and on the third attempt I was able to get in," Cameron says. He turned on Apple's Find My iPhone feature and had Vasquez's location within minutes. Vasquez, whose iPhone battery was at 12%, was found "face down" in the ravine in San Jose's mountains, her phone out of reach, ABC News reports. Though Vasquez had been thrown from her vehicle, which was on its roof with two tires ripped off, she was "awake, coherent, and she was speaking to officers," a cop explains. She was airlifted to the hospital with "major injuries" to her legs and abdomen but is expected to survive. "I think somebody was looking out for her. Things fell in place and had those things not fallen in place, it could have been a totally different story," says Cameron, who plans to visit Vasquez soon. (It's not the first time an Apple product has come to the rescue.)

Original Story:  – Hillary Clinton announced her opposition to the historically massive Trans-Pacific Partnership Wednesday, further distancing herself from the Obama administration while aligning herself with the more liberal wing of the Democratic party, including primary opponent Bernie Sanders, Politico reports. "As of today, I am not in favor of what I have learned about it,” Clinton tells PBS. “I don’t believe it’s going to meet the high bar I have set." Clinton had previously supported the deal while working for the administration as secretary of state. PBS reports the deal between the US and 11 other countries would remove trade barriers and set labor and environmental standards. It would be the largest regional trade agreement in history. Clinton tells PBS she opposes the deal because it doesn't address currency manipulation and appears to be better for pharmaceutical companies than patients. Sanders, who Clinton will be debating in a few days, claims the agreement will be bad for American consumers and jobs. The New York Times reports Clinton's position could help her steal liberal and union support from Sanders and distance her from Vice President Biden, who may enter the race. According to Politico, Clinton's announcement is part of a "striking string of disagreements with Obama" over issues like the Keystone XL pipeline and the Affordable Care Act's so-called Cadillac tax. The Trans-Pacific Partnership was completed Monday and still needs to be approved by Congress, PBS reports.

Original Story:  – The full-body airport scanners that have prompted controversy on these shores have now been banned throughout the European Union, reports ProPublica. The fracas in the US has largely been over privacy, but the EU’s decision was a matter of “health and safety,” it says. The X-ray scanners in the US use ionizing radiation, which has been linked to cancer—studies suggest a handful of cases out of hundreds of millions of passengers. Instead, EU countries will use millimeter-wave scanners, which employ radio frequency waves and have not been linked to cancer. The TSA uses such millimeter-wave scanners, too; among the 500 scanners currently in use in the US, about half are body scanner (also known as backscatter) and half millimeter-wave. Read the full ProPublica post here or an earlier report on the health concerns here.

Police say the 22-year-old Texas man tried to carve his name with a car key into a 250-year-old wall in the Monks' Burial Room, creating a 3-by-1-inch gash in the recently designated World Heritage site. Per the police report, a tour guide reportedly spotted Perez notching "Julio" into the limestone and told him to stop, and an Alamo security guard nabbed him and a female companion when they tried to escape, the San Antonio Express-News notes. "In Texas we take our history seriously and consider the Alamo to be sacred ground," the Alamo Rangers chief said in a statement, per the New York Daily News. "Desecration of any part of these hallowed grounds, especially the walls of the Alamo Chapel, will not be tolerated." Perez has been charged with second-degree felony criminal mischief, and the damaged room has been closed to the public as preservation experts try to figure out how to how to fix the carving.

The Christmas Day spacewalk is one of three that NASA has scheduled over the next week to carry out the repairs, which have delayed the launch of a private cargo spacecraft, Space.com reports. The problem started last week, when the fault forced the station to close down one of its two ammonia cooling systems, reports Voice of America. The six-member station crew—the two Americans plus three Russians and a Japanese astronaut—is not in any danger; the shutdown has halted a lot of research and if a problem arises with the second cooling system before the first one is fixed, the crew could be forced to return to Earth early.

The Mohave County Sheriff's Office said Sunday that a boat carrying 10 people and another vessel with six people on board collided head-on after dark Saturday night on the river that borders California and Arizona. Authorities say both boats sank, throwing everyone aboard into the water; passing boaters helped pull victims from the water, though the search had to be called off at 9pm local time. It resumed early Monday. One person was found in critical condition and flown to a hospital in Las Vegas. Nine others were taken to local hospitals by ambulance. Authorities are searching for four people who remain missing. Anita Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the Mohave County Sheriff's Office, says none of the boaters were wearing life vests when the collision occurred. The crash happened in Moabi Regional Park, a popular water recreation area along the border about 290 miles east of Los Angeles. The area was packed with people celebrating ahead of Labor Day, notes ABC News.

Original Story:  – It was in early morning darkness that officers scrambled to sort out the chaos at an Albuquerque apartment complex where a couple had reportedly been attacked, the woman bleeding from a head injury and the man with a black eye and wearing blood-stained shorts. The woman told officers her 10-year-old daughter was still inside apartment number 808 from which they had escaped. What the officers didn't know was that the child was already dead, her battered and dismembered body partially wrapped in a blanket and set ablaze. With the fire alarm blaring, they busted in the front door and searched the smoke-filled apartment for Victoria Martens. In the bathroom, the real crime began to come into focus, the AP reports. Investigators took into custody the girl's mother, her boyfriend, and his cousin. The community was left struggling to understand how a blossoming elementary school student who loved swimming and gymnastics could have been the target of such violence. Details of what New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and law enforcement officials described as an unspeakable crime emerged in a criminal complaint made public Thursday. Police said Victoria was injected with methamphetamine, sexually assaulted, strangled, and stabbed before being dismembered Wednesday—her 10th birthday. The girl's mother, 35-year-old Michelle Martens, her 31-year-old boyfriend, Fabian Gonzales, and his 31-year-old cousin, Jessica Kelley, face charges of child abuse resulting in death, kidnapping, and tampering with evidence. Gonzales and Kelley also face charges of criminal sexual penetration of a minor. Martens told police she met Gonzales online about a month ago and that he drugged the girl so he could calm her down and have sex with her, the complaint says. Per KOB, Martens says Gonzales then strangled the girl and Kelley stabbed her in the chest.

Original Story:  – Doctors are hesitant to call it a cure, but a Mississippi girl born with HIV remains in "clear remission" after beginning treatment 30 hours after her birth, according to a new report published online yesterday. The child received a cocktail of antiretroviral drugs for 18 months; another 18 months later, the girl, now 3, shows no sign of active infection according to tests described by HealthDay as the "most sensitive available." But one AIDS scientist explains why he and his peers are so hesitant to call it a cure: Unlike with cancers, "where after five years or so you can be relatively certain the person is not going to go and relapse," there is no definition for an AIDS cure yet. So instead, "we're calling it remission because we'd like to observe the child for a longer time and be absolutely sure there's no rebound," one of her doctors tells the AP. HealthDay adds that some tests have found "very low-level indications" of HIV in her blood; they could be one of two things: false positives, or remnants of the virus. If they're the latter, the possibility exists that they could cause a rebound. One thing doctors are now sure of: that the girl was indeed infected in the womb. (Some skeptics initially though the positive test at birth may have been due to her exposure to the virus in her mother's blood, and not because of true infection.) A government-sponsored international study set to begin in January will test this early treatment in babies born with HIV to see if the results in this case can be replicated.

Original Story:  – Just as the tobacco industry aimed to quash evidence of health risks linked to smoking, a new paper claims the Sugar Research Foundation decades ago suppressed research on the sugar's negative effects. The assertion comes via University of California at San Francisco researchers who reviewed internal sugar industry documents, per a release. NPR explains what they say they found: In 1968, the SRF funded a researcher's study that looked at the impact a high-sugar (versus starch) diet had on lab rats. The initial findings pointed to an increase in their triglyceride (that's a fat in your blood) levels and noted elevated levels of an enzyme linked to bladder cancer in their urine. The researcher shared initial findings, and SRF opted not to fund the previously authorized three-month extension needed to finish the research. "Had this information been made public, there would have been a lot more research scrutiny of sugar," says paper author Cristin Kearns. She suspects more potential manipulation as "ISRF sponsored more than 300 research projects between 1943 and 1972, and its successor organizations continue to fund research," she tells the Guardian. But one successor, the Sugar Association, argues the research published in PLOS Biology is only a "collection of speculations and assumptions." It says the 1968 study was ended because it was delayed, over budget, and occurred during "organizational restructuring" in which the SRF became the International Sugar Research Foundation. "There were plans to continue the study with funding from the British Nutrition Foundation, but, for reasons unbeknown to us, this did not occur."
Original Summary:  Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, have found that the Sugar Research Foundation (SRF) suppressed research on the negative effects of sugar on health, based on internal documents reviewed. In 1968, the SRF funded a study that showed increased triglyceride levels and elevated levels of an enzyme linked to bladder cancer in rats fed a high-sugar diet, but the study was not completed due to the SRF's decision not to fund the extension.

Original Story:  – The photographer credited with helping make the civil rights struggle a national issue has died. Charles Moore, 79, a news photographer for the Montgomery Advertiser and Life between 1958 to 1965, often placed himself in harm's way to capture shocking images of police attacking protesters. He began covering the movement as the sole photographer when Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested in 1958. Moore captured some of the most enduring images of the civil rights movement, and the national outrage they created helped speed up the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a University of Florida journalism professor tells the Los Angeles Times. "He had the courage to stand up in the face of danger and let Americans know what was really happening, through his work," the professor says. "That is why he is an unsung hero."

Original Story:  – The world's most-wanted Nazi is dead, and he died without regrets about his role in the murder of thousands of Jews. That's according to Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff, who says a German secret service agent recently revealed that Alois Brunner, Adolf Eichmann's "best man," died in Syria four years ago at the age of 98, the Times of Israel reports. Brunner handled the deportation of more than 128,000 Jews to Nazi death camps, but he evaded capture and landed in Syria, where he's said to have advised President Hafez al-Assad on torture methods he honed during his SS tenure, the Daily Express reports. "He was involved in the harsh treatment of the Jewish community of Syria and was an expert in terror and torture," Zuroff, head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Israeli office, tells the Express. "He said himself his one regret was he did not kill more Jews. He was unrepentant." Brunner was able to flee because authorities mistakenly hanged SS member Anton Brunner for crimes Alois committed. He then claimed he got paperwork from "American authorities" under an assumed name and served as a US Army driver, Arutz Sheva reports. In 1954, he used a fake Red Cross passport to travel to Rome, then Egypt (where the New York Times reported he rented a room from a Jewish family he described as being "quite nice people, really") before heading to Syria. Per the Times of Israel, the late Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal wrote in his memoirs, "In my eyes, he was the worst [Third Reich criminal] ever. While Adolf Eichmann drew up the general staff plan for the extermination of the Jews, Alois Brunner implemented it." Zuroff says the center will now take Brunner's name off the "wanted" list to concentrate on nabbing other surviving Nazis. (In other Holocaust news, an awful theft that's being described as a "great loss".)

Original Story:  – A man presumed dead for decades as a potential victim of serial killer John Wayne Gacy has been found alive and well in Montana. The AP reports that Robert Hutton was located in April after his sister submitted his name as a possible Gacy victim, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said yesterday. Investigators in Dart's office collected DNA samples two years ago from the remains of eight unnamed victims in an effort to ID them, and investigators acted quickly on the Hutton lead because of how closely he fit the victim profile: Hutton, who was 21 when he was last heard from in 1972, was a hitchhiker who often traveled by bus, worked in construction, and presumably passed through Chicago, where Gacy lived. Investigators eventually traced a man with the same identifying information to Colorado, only to learn he had moved. They later located the same man in rural Montana, and he confirmed to local law enforcement authorities that he was the same Robert Hutton who disappeared in 1972. The sheriff’s detective who spoke with Hutton tells the Sun-Times, "He said that he had just gotten caught up in the ’70s lifestyle, so to speak ... years went by and he became a little bit embarrassed that he hadn’t had contact with his family, and I think it made it easier to dismiss them." Dart said Hutton has visited his father and plans to visit his sister. The Sun-Times has this odd fact: Hutton lived in the same Montana town as his father’s brother-in-law, and the two had actually met—but never swapped last names. Since the Gacy investigation was reopened, one additional victim has been identified and seven missing persons cases have been closed; five were found alive and two had died of natural causes.

Original Story:  – The routine part of this shoplifting story out of Miami is that police stopped a woman trying to leave a supermarket with $300 worth of unpaid-for food. The not-so-routine part: Upon hearing that the accused was a mother of three in dire straits, the arresting officer went back in the store and shelled out $100 from her own pocket to buy the woman groceries, reports WSVN. "I made the decision to buy her some groceries because arresting her wasn't going to solve the problem with her children being hungry," says officer Vicki Thomas. She still charged Jessica Robles with a misdemeanor, but she also educated her about local food banks and other sources of help. "She asked, 'Do you even have food at the house?' And I looked at her in her face, and I told her, 'Not at all,'" recalls Robles. For the record, the Miami-Dade department has no problem with Thomas' actions. "Police officers do have discretion, and what Thomas did was completely in bounds," a spokesperson tells AOL.
Original Summary:  A police officer in Miami went beyond the call of duty by using her own money to buy groceries for a mother of three who was caught shoplifting $300 worth of food. Despite charging the woman with a misdemeanor, the officer also provided her with information on local food banks and other resources to help her and her children.
