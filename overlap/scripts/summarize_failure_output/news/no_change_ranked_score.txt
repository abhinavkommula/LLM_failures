Original Story:  – In the incredibly off-chance she's elected president, Dr. Jill Stein might consider forcing Ohio to choose new city names that don't start with the letter C. The Columbus Dispatch reports the Green Party candidate was expected to be two hours late to a rally at Ohio's Capital University after she accidentally flew into Cincinnati instead of Columbus. Capital University is in Bexley, just outside of Columbus, while Cincinnati is more than 120 miles away, the Los Angeles Times helpfully explains. Where was it when Stein was booking her tickets? Pizzas were ordered to tide over the 100 or so people gathered at Capital University to hear Stein speak. It's unclear how many of them planned on waiting around for her to make the two-hour drive, pizzas or no. Stein received 0.3% of the vote in Ohio when she ran in 2012, slightly worse than she did nationally. And while USA Today reports she's currently polling at a much-improved 2% in the state, this whole Columbus/Cincinnati debacle probably isn't going to help.
Original Summary:  Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, was expected to speak at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, but accidentally flew into Cincinnati instead, causing a two-hour delay. Despite improved polling numbers in Ohio, Stein's mistake may hinder her chances of being elected president.

Original Story:  – In four days, The Interview pulled in $15 million, Sony Pictures says in a press release. That's in the period through Saturday, during which, Sony says, the film was rented or bought two million times online, deadline.com reports. But its success so far isn't something to be proud of, writes David Rogers at Politico. It's all about "a real live person" being assassinated, and that's not funny. "When did assassination become a subject for American humor?" Rogers wonders. "This is a nation that still mourns Abraham Lincoln, John Kennedy, and Martin Luther King." "If America is to be a moral force, doesn’t it have to look inside itself as to what killing really is?" he asks, questioning how we'd react if, for instance, "North Korea made a comedy about white racists plotting to assassinate Obama." As for the president's own comments on the movie: Obama may make light of the Seth Rogen effort, but killing, Rogers writes, is "a shadow on your soul that you carry forever." He compares the silly film to another recent movie, Clint Eastwood's American Sniper, which tells the story of former Navy SEAL Chris Kyle. Kyle was killed last year: Would he find The Interview funny? Rogers asks. Click for the full piece, or read another stance from a critic who calls the film "an insult to satire."
Original Summary:  The Interview has grossed $15 million in four days, according to Sony Pictures, with two million rentals or purchases online. However, some critics, such as David Rogers at Politico, have expressed concern that the film's depiction of assassination is not funny and raises questions about the morality of killing, particularly in light of recent real-life events such as the death of Chris Kyle.

Original Story:  – A new study finds that children who are "highly engaged" with superheroes were more likely to be aggressive a year later. Researchers twice evaluated 240 preschoolers and kindergartners at four sites across the western US, analyzing their levels of three types of aggression at both points: physical (hitting, kicking), relational (hurting others' feelings through behaviors like ignoring), and verbal (name-calling). Parents reported on their kids' favorite superheroes and just how big of a fan their kids were—how often they watched movies or shows featuring superheroes, for example, and how strongly the kids identified with their favorite hero. The children also answered questions. In the end, researchers found that kids who were more engaged with superheroes were more likely to be physically and relationally aggressive at their second evaluation. Also troubling: The children were not found to be emulating superheroes in other ways, such as by being more likely to help or defend others, Pacific Standard reports. "Children in early childhood may be particularly at risk for the negative effects of media violence exposure when the superhero medium is emphasized," the researchers conclude. They theorize that at such a young age, it may be tricky for kids to "disentangle" the aggressive behaviors superheroes demonstrate from the altruistic, "pro-social" behaviors. They also speculate that exposure to superheroes may be more problematic for children than exposure to other types of aggression in media because parents tend to "endorse and support" a child's love of superheroes, in the hopes that their kids might learn to help others, Psych Central reports. (Want better behaved kids? Turn off violent TV.)

Original Story:  – A California woman apparently befriended a homeless woman, allowed the woman to sleep in her car, and then continued to drive the car—for months—after the homeless woman died. Police don’t suspect foul play, but are not sure why the woman didn’t report the death—which could have occurred anywhere from three to 10 months ago, the Los Angeles Times reports. The body was only discovered when officers responded to reports of an illegally parked vehicle. They found the woman “in a mummified state.” “In our profession, right when you get to that point where you think you've seen it all, something else comes along that says, 'Well, I guess I've seen something else that I'd never expected,'” an officer tells AOL News. “It’s definitely one of the more bizarre things that I've come across."

Original Story:  – Rick Perry made his debate debut tonight, and it's clear the new frontrunner is happy to mix it up. He and Mitt Romney went after each other with gusto, notes AP, as evidenced by an early exchange: After Perry criticized Romney's record of creating jobs in Massachusetts, Romney zinged back by saying that Perry taking credit for job growth in Texas is like Al Gore taking credit for the Internet. “Michael Dukakis created jobs three times faster than you did, Mitt,” Perry said. “As a matter of fact,” Romney retorted, “George Bush and his predecessor created jobs at a faster rate than you did, Governor.” Later, Perry called Social Security a "Ponzi scheme," while Romney said, “Our nominee has got to be someone who isn’t committed to abolishing Social Security," notes Politico. Some other tidbits: Michele Bachmann said she is the candidate most committed to repealing ObamaCare. "None of us should ever think that the repeal bill will just come to our desk." Jon Huntsman: "I hate to rain on the parade of the great Lone Star State governor, but as governor of Utah, we were the No. 1 job creator during my years in service." Later, on evolution and climate science: "In order for the Republican Party to win, we can't run from science." Ron Paul went after Perry numerous times, including once for writing a letter to Hillary Clinton praising her health care efforts in the 1990s. Rick Santorum, "citing Reagan's aggressive foreign policy, complains that some of the other Republicans on stage are isolationists," notes the Wall Street Journal's live blog. Like Paul and Bachmann, he also went after Perry, who complained at one point about feeling like a "pinata," for his attempt to mandate an HPV vaccine for girls. Newt Gingrich again preached against the media trying to encourage fights among candidates. He also said he wants to fire Ben Bernanke immediately. Herman Cain called for rewriting the tax code. "If 10% is good enough for God, 9% is good enough for the federal government."

Original Story:  – The captain of the El Faro planned to sail ahead of Hurricane Joaquin, but the cargo ship was doomed by a mechanical failure that left it at the mercy of the storm, according to the vessel's owner. The CEO of Tote Services says the captain, who was last heard from on Thursday morning, had determined that the weather was good enough to follow a sister ship's path back to Jacksonville, Fla., the AP reports. "Regrettably he suffered a mechanical problem with his main propulsion system, which left him in the path of the storm," the CEO says. "We do not know when his engine problems began to occur, nor the reasons for his engine problems." The Coast Guard believes the ship, with a crew of 28 Americans and five Poles, sank in 15,000 feet of water near the Bahamas. Mariners tell the AP that the ship would probably have been able to make it through the worst of the storm if it had engine power, but without it, it would have been helpless and even abandoning ship would have been extremely difficult. Such disasters are extremely rare, reports the Atlantic. Until the El Faro, more Boeing 777s had been lost at sea than large cargo ships over the last five years, and, amid a huge volume of maritime traffic, only six were lost in the decade from 2005, although dozens more ran aground or sank with some warning. Searchers are now looking for survivors instead of the ship itself, though all they have found so far is debris and a survival suit with "unidentifiable" human remains.
Original Summary:  The El Faro, a cargo ship with a crew of 33, was doomed by a mechanical failure that left it vulnerable to Hurricane Joaquin. Despite the captain's decision to sail ahead of the storm, the ship suffered an engine failure, making it unable to escape the storm's path.

Original Story:  – Puerto Rico is still struggling weeks after two powerful hurricanes last month—the territory's Electric Power Authority said Wednesday morning that power service was at 25%—but, thanks to Tesla, electricity has been restored at a San Juan children's hospital. The company used its solar panels and batteries to create a solar array in a parking lot next to Hospital del Niño that generates all the energy the hospital needs, reports NPR, citing local media. Tesla tweeted pictures of the array this week, calling the project the "first of many solar+storage projects going live" in Puerto Rico. For now, the head of the hospital says, the setup is a donation, but a deal could eventually make it permanent after the crisis has passed. Rebuilding Puerto Rico's power grid could take months and cost as much as $5 billion, but other companies are similarly stepping in to help; Google's parent company, for example, has helped to restore internet service. Last week, the Electric Power Authority signed a contract with a small and somewhat new company to restore the power grid, causing some concern; on Wednesday, it was announced that retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot has been appointed to oversee the grid's restoration, the AP reports. "We are deeply concerned both about why and how a small, inexperienced firm was tasked with the massive job of rebuilding Puerto Rico's devastated electrical grid," Nancy Pelosi said in a statement, praising Zamot's appointment and ability to provide additional scrutiny of the process.

Original Story:  – Dubai is, generally speaking, a fat nation. It also happens to be a very rich nation, and those two factors have combined to create an unusual weight-loss offer from the government: It will give people gold based on how many pounds they drop, reports Emirates 24/7. The month-long initiative got underway this week. Specifically, people will get a gram of gold, worth about $45, for each kilogram (2.2 pounds) lost, reports AP. Participants also get a chance to win a $5,000 gold bar at the end. In a nation where half the people are considered overweight and where diabetes is on the rise, the government figures it needs to try something, notes the LA Times. But skeptics abound: "Dubai residents are already so rich (the UAE has a GDP per capita of over $45,000 per year) that getting a couple hundred bucks for giving up the convenience of McDonald’s may not be an attractive enough incentive," writes Ariel Schwartz at Co.Exist. And Emily Shire at the Week says the incentive doesn't address a root problem: "High temperatures (regularly over 100 degrees) that deter exercise coupled with the growing presence of Western fast food have had a toxic effect on weight and health." (The obese also might be able to blame their genes, now with scientific evidence to back them up.)
Original Summary:  The government of Dubai has launched a month-long weight loss initiative that offers gold to residents who lose weight, with a gram of gold worth $45 given for each kilogram (2.2 pounds) lost.

Original Story:  – The man accused of driving a van into worshippers near a London mosque early Monday has been named as 47-year-old Darren Osborne—a man described as "aggressive," "strange," "cuckoo," and "a bloody psycho" by neighbors in Cardiff, Wales. Witnesses say Osborne shouted "I want to kill all Muslims" after the attack, which left one person dead and 11 injured, the Guardian reports. Neighbors say he was always troublesome but his behavior had deteriorated in recent weeks and he had been thrown out of a local pub over the weekend for "cursing Muslims and saying he would do some damage." He also allegedly abused a 10-year-old Muslim neighbor, telling him he was "inbred." Osborne's sister tells the Evening Standard that he was "troubled," but was so unpolitical she doubts he knows who the country's prime minister is. Neighbors say Osborne had split up with the mother of his four children in recent weeks and had been living in a tent he put up in woodland or sometimes in the backyard of the home they used to share. Police believe he rented the van used in the attack on Sunday and drove the 150 miles to London, the Telegraph reports. After the Finsbury Park attack, he was restrained by bystanders, with an imam convincing people to stop hitting him. Police say Osborne is being held on suspicion of terrorist offenses and attempted murder.

Original Story:  – A couple's first date in California's San Bernardino National Forest turned out to be anything but romantic yesterday as the remains of Hurricane Linda sent a storm of heavy rain and hail over the area. While hiking in Forest Falls, east of Los Angeles, the pair became trapped in a flash flood and attempted to cross a waist-deep river runoff hand in hand, a fire official tells NBC Los Angeles. The current soon pulled both underwater and the frantic woman watched as her date was swept away. An off-duty police officer heard her screams and was able to pull her from the water, while another hiker also ran to help. "We just found her in a state of shock," he says. Police called off the search for the Rancho Cucamonga man, 29, when a body was found about a mile from where he vanished, report KABC and CBS Los Angeles. A hiker's backpack was also found. Also in San Bernardino County yesterday, fire officials say they had to rescue an individual whose vehicle was swept away in a flash flood, per the AP. NBC Los Angeles reports a man—it's not clear if he's the same person—exited his vehicle and was swept into a storm drain. He was found alive, though his current condition is unknown. A flash flood warning is still in effect for the area; trees have been uprooted and streets are still filled with water. (This first date also ended badly.)

Please focus on relevant details, only answer with the summary.– A couple's first date in California's San Bernardino National Forest turned out to be anything but romantic yesterday as the remains of Hurricane Linda sent a storm of heavy rain and hail over the area. While hiking in Forest Falls, east of Los Angeles, the pair became trapped in a flash flood and attempted to cross a waist-deep river runoff hand in hand, a fire official tells NBC Los Angeles. The current soon pulled both underwater and the frantic woman watched as her date was swept away. An off-duty police officer heard her screams and was able to pull her from the water, while another hiker also ran to help. "We just found her in a state of shock," he says. Police called off the search for the Rancho Cucamonga man, 29, when a body was found about a mile from where he vanished, report KABC and CBS Los Angeles. A hiker's backpack was also found. Also in San Bernardino County yesterday, fire officials say they had to rescue an individual whose vehicle was swept away in a flash flood, per the AP. NBC Los Angeles reports a man—it's not clear if he's the same person—exited his vehicle and was swept into a storm drain. He was found alive, though his current condition is unknown. A flash flood warning is still in effect for the area; trees have been uprooted and streets are still filled with water. (This first date also ended badly.)

Original Story:  – Southern Kansas and Oklahoma are experiencing small, daily quakes linked with fracking that make a larger and more destructive earthquake much more likely, according to a new, unpublished federal study. The risk remains low—about a 1 in 2,500 years' chance—but if true, it ranks the region among top-risk areas east of the Rocky Mountains, the AP reports. Those areas include Charleston, SC, and New Madrid, Missouri, which both suffered serious earthquakes during the past 200 years. "The more small earthquakes we have, it just simply increases the odds we're going to have a more damaging event," said geophysicist William Ellsworth after presenting the study to a science association. A Kansas geological official responded with, "We are worried about this, no question about it." Meanwhile, another study says that hidden geological faults in Oklahoma are ready to to burst—including ones that were just discovered and may damage vital structures, LiveScience reports. Published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the study located faults by looking at more than 3,600 recent earthquakes in Oklahoma. "These faults are all in rock layers that existed when the dinosaurs were around," says study author Daniel McNamara. "Some of them haven't been active since then." On the bright side, a third study shows that fewer faults in Montana and the Dakotas—also drilling "hotbeds"—are ready to pop, and Ellsworth says the rate of man-made quakes has actually dropped in some "fracking states," like Arkansas and Ohio. (Is the eastern US also due for a "big one"?)

Original Story:  – Following Chuck Hagel's exit as defense secretary, the obvious question is who might replace him. One leading possibility: former undersecretary of defense for policy Michèle Flournoy—the defense department's highest-ranking woman ever, ABC News reports. She stepped down in 2012 and now heads a nonpartisan national security think tank thought to have played a big role in President Obama's policymaking, the Washington Post reports. Some administration officials, however, believe she has sided too readily with the uniformed military, which could lead to disagreements with the president, the Post notes. But her perceived hawkishness could play well with Republicans during the Senate confirmation process, Politico reports, and she was on Obama's shortlist the last time around. Other top names in the running: Former deputy defense secretary Ashton Carter oversaw budgeting amid tough times for the Pentagon between 2011 and 2013, ABC notes. He was a Rhodes scholar and Harvard professor, the Post reports, but he hasn't been hugely influential politically. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island is set to be the Democrats' top official on the Armed Services Committee. He recently won re-election and became known after criticizing the handling of the Iraq War in a response to a State of the Union speech by George W. Bush. But he doesn't want the Pentagon job, says a rep: He "loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island." Robert Work is currently in the No. 2 position at the Pentagon, Politico notes. The retired Marine colonel has dealt extensively with the department's budget, the Post notes, and he has headed the same think tank Flournoy now leads. And Politico raises the possibility that the likes of former generals David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal could get the job. Both faced scandals before leaving their posts, but "they command a lot of respect with the military as well as with the Republicans," and they "worked with (the) Obama administration," says an analyst.

Original Story:  – Newt Gingrich has shaken up his struggling campaign, but it doesn't look like he'll be dropping out any time soon. The candidate—short on cash and a distant third in the delegate count—is replacing his campaign manager, laying off close to a third of his staff, and cutting back his schedule, Politico reports. His communications chief says the campaign is switching focus to winning a "big-choice convention in August." If Mitt Romney can't secure the necessary 1,144 delegates by the final primaries, "he will be unable to do so at the convention, where the vast majority of the delegates are conservative," creating an environment in which Gingrich can emerge as the one candidate who can "unite social, economic, and national security conservatives," says the aide. A pro-Gingrich super PAC funded by billionaire Sheldon Adelson is nearly out of cash, the Washington Post notes, and Gingrich has started charging supporters $50 to have their photo taken with him.

Original Story:  – It. Has. Begun. On Friday, Rep. John Delaney of Maryland officially became the first Democrat running to defeat President Trump in 2020. Delaney, 54, made the announcement with an op-ed in the Washington Post. "It is time for us to rise above our broken politics and renew the spirit that enabled us to achieve the seemingly impossible," he writes. He says he believes he has an "original approach to governing" that will work for the American people and touts his "blue-collar family" and his past as a "successful entrepreneur" and job creator. The Baltimore Sun reports Delaney started a company that loaned money to nursing homes and doctors and founded a commercial and retail bank. At 32, he became the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange. Delaney will have an uphill battle to the presidency for multiple reasons. For one, the Democratic Party may be moving leftward too quickly for Delaney to keep up. Despite describing himself as progressive, his reputation in the House is as a bipartisan centrist. He opposes the $15 minimum wage and supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, CNN reports. He also isn't well-known nationally—though being able to spend millions of his own fortune on his campaign could help with that. Delaney's early announcement for president is a sign of two things: Pretty much every Democrat in elected office thinks they can beat Trump, and the race for the Democratic nomination could be wide open with Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren all potentially sitting out.
Original Summary:  Rep. John Delaney of Maryland has become the first Democrat to announce a bid to defeat President Trump in 2020, with an op-ed in the Washington Post.

Original Story:  – A clearer timeline of the Las Vegas shooting is coming into focus, though exactly what Stephen Paddock was up to during the 72 minutes between the first 911 call and the time officers entered his suite at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino is still taking shape. NBC News reports the first 911 call came at 10:08pm local time, just as a police officer on the scene raised the alarm: "We got shots fired, sounds like an automatic firearm," the officer said over a police radio channel, per the New York Times. Less than a minute later, an officer described shots as "coming from upstairs in the Mandalay Bay," per the Times. Within minutes, an officer who'd reached the 31st floor of the 43-story Mandalay Bay commented that he could hear "automatic fire coming from … one floor above us." Per a Times analysis of video of 15 seconds of the attack, about 90 shots were fired in just 10 seconds. Police communications suggest the shooting had ended by 10:25pm, when officers arrived outside Suite 135 on the 32nd floor, though a hotel security guard was at one point shot through the suite door. It took almost an hour for SWAT teams to secure the floor before Paddock's room was accessed using an explosive device. Paddock, who'd allegedly smashed the floor-to-ceiling windows in the suite in order to take aim at a crowd of 22,000 gathered for the Route 91 Harvest festival 500 yards away, was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at 11:20pm, per the Las Vegas Review-Journal. It's unclear at what point during the preceding hour Paddock died.

Original Story:  – Three men were arrested for an alleged shooting that took place about an hour after white nationalist Richard Spencer's University of Florida speech ended Thursday, and Gainesville police say the men yelled "Heil Hitler" before shots were fired. Tyler Tenbrink and brothers Colton and William Fears, all from Texas, have been charged with attempted homicide, CBS 4 reports. The three had spoken to the media supporting Spencer and his views hours before the shooting; police say after the speech ended, they were in a Jeep and started making Nazi salutes and shouting at people near a bus stop who were holding anti-Nazi signs, the AP reports. One of the victims hit the Jeep's back window with a baton, after which it stopped and the Fears brothers, threatening to kill the protesters, allegedly urged Tenbrink to shoot, which he allegedly did. The shot hit a nearby building, and police say the three suspects then drove away. They were picked up later after victims called police and gave their license plate number. Police say Tenbrink admitted to shooting; he is also charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. They also say at least two of the men have connections to extremist groups. (Ohio State on Friday denied a request from Spencer to speak at the school.)

Original Story:  – The Cleveland Cavaliers earned a third straight trip to the NBA finals and LeBron James secured a place in the history books Thursday night by surpassing Michael Jordan's record as the all-time NBA playoffs scorer. James scored 35 points in the 135-102 win over the Boston Celtics and overtook the record Jordan set in 1998 during the third period, when a 3-pointer put him over the 5,987 mark, ESPN reports. "I wear the number because of Mike," No. 23 said after the game. "I think I fell in love with the game because of Mike, just because of what he was able to accomplish. When you're watching Michael Jordan, it's almost like a god. So I didn't think I could be Mike." Before the game, James claimed he was "not a scorer." "I don't want to be labeled as a scorer. I can put the ball in the hoop," he said. "I'm a playmaker. I'm a player. Put me on the court and I find ways to be successful." For James, this will be the seventh straight trip to the finals, and for the Cavaliers, Eastern Conference champs, it will be the third final against the Golden State Warriors in a row, the AP reports. The Cavs lost in 2015, but they scored the first NBA title in franchise history in 2016. James is 32 years old, and in a look at NBA scoring records, the New York Times notes that since the league stopped drafting players out of high school in 2005, it doesn't look as if any current player will be able to beat his record.
