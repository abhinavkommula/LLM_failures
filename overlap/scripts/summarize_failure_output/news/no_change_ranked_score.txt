Original Story:  – Brad Pitt didn’t believe in the death penalty … until the BP oil spill. Now he says he is “willing to look at it again” when it comes to those responsible for the crisis. The remark is part of Spike Lee’s documentary, If God is Willing and Da Creek Don’t Rise, premiering tonight on HBO. The film, marking the fifth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, is a follow-up to his 2006 When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts. Lee said the film was planned to be “much more upbeat,” but then the Gulf oil spill happened, the Daily Mail reports. Pitt’s not the only one who’s angry: In an interview with GQ, Lee says he doesn’t know “why Obama ever trusted these BP guys! They would lie to their mothers. Hayward does not give a fuck. The thing we don't talk about is that eleven Americans lost their lives and it took seven weeks to invite their families to the White House. I'm not trying to bash my man, but that's a long time.” Click here for more.
Original Summary:  Brad Pitt has expressed a willingness to reconsider the death penalty for those responsible for the BP oil spill, after previously being opposed to it. Spike Lee is angry about the lack of action taken by the Obama administration in response to the spill, particularly the delay in inviting the families of the eleven Americans who died to the White House.

Original Story:  – In the incredibly off-chance she's elected president, Dr. Jill Stein might consider forcing Ohio to choose new city names that don't start with the letter C. The Columbus Dispatch reports the Green Party candidate was expected to be two hours late to a rally at Ohio's Capital University after she accidentally flew into Cincinnati instead of Columbus. Capital University is in Bexley, just outside of Columbus, while Cincinnati is more than 120 miles away, the Los Angeles Times helpfully explains. Where was it when Stein was booking her tickets? Pizzas were ordered to tide over the 100 or so people gathered at Capital University to hear Stein speak. It's unclear how many of them planned on waiting around for her to make the two-hour drive, pizzas or no. Stein received 0.3% of the vote in Ohio when she ran in 2012, slightly worse than she did nationally. And while USA Today reports she's currently polling at a much-improved 2% in the state, this whole Columbus/Cincinnati debacle probably isn't going to help.
Original Summary:  Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate, was expected to speak at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, but accidentally flew into Cincinnati instead, causing a two-hour delay. Despite improved polling numbers in Ohio, Stein's mistake may hinder her chances of being elected president.

Original Story:  – When Lindsey and Steve Justice found out they were expecting septuplets, they considered it "a miracle," Lindsey says. The North Carolina couple, parents to 2- and 4-year-old girls, found out Lindsey has polycystic ovary syndrome while trying to conceive a third time, USA Today reports. She took fertility drugs, and as soon as doctors realized she was carrying at least six babies—they later discovered it was actually seven—the Justices were asked about selective reduction, which would mean terminating some of the pregnancies so the others might have a better shot of surviving. "Steve and I didn't even have to look at each other," Lindsey tells WCNC. "That was just not going to be an option." The babies, given names by their parents that spelled out "Messiah" (Mercy, Evie, Shiloh, Sage, Issac, Aspen, and Honor), needed to make it to the critical 23-week mark—but didn't. They found out Issac had died at 12 weeks; at 16 weeks, they found out the other six babies were all girls. But at 21 weeks, Lindsey started having contractions, and on Sept. 23, she gave birth to Mercy. "We said goodbye to Mercy, and I was laying on that table for two hours trying to do everything I could in my power, which was nothing, to relax and stop having contractions," she says. The other five babies were born and survived about two hours as their parents held them. Despite the sadness, "I would do the past ... 21 weeks again and again and again if I had the choice," Lindsey says. They're telling their story to spread the idea of hope amid sorrow—on their blog, they write, "It was in that operating room that we experienced the greatest pain and sorrow we have ever experienced. But it was in that operating room that we beheld and embraced the glory of God like never before." (Another story grabbing headlines this week: The baby who completed a bucket list before his ever-so-brief life began.)

Original Story:  – Although responses to Pope Francis have been chiefly positive, one dark stain in church history is raising serious questions about the new pope—the church's role during the dictatorship in Argentina, reports the Guardian. The church backed the dictatorship during its rule from 1976 to 1983, urging its followers to be patriotic and support the regime, too, even as thousands of people were abducted and murdered by the government, including many progressive priests. As the head of the Jesuit order in Argentina from 1973 to 1979, Jorge Bergoglio was part of the church hierarchy and has been accused of working with the dictatorship. In 2005, Bergoglio was accused in a lawsuit of withdrawing church protection from two anti-government priests, leading to their incarceration under brutal conditions in 1976, reports the New York Times. Bergoglio has called the allegation "slander" and claimed he worked behind the scenes to help the priests, but he has twice refused to testify in court about what his role had been. "I still have many doubts about his role regarding the Jesuits who went missing under the dictatorship," says the leader of a group of left-wing priests. Others praise Bergoglio for his role in the "monumental task" of healing the church's black eye after the war: "If he can restore the credibility of the church (in Argentina)," says one expert, "he can handle the scandals that have befallen the church worldwide.

Original Story:  – A "veteran" Oscars stage manager has given his behind-the-scenes perspective on the Best Picture snafu, and he comes off as none-too-impressed with the "frozen" PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants involved. In a lengthy interview with The Wrap, Gary Natoli says Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz were supposed to have memorized the list of winners, and protocol dictated that if a winner was announced who didn't sync with that memorized list, they'd leap into action. But when La La Land was named, Ruiz—who was steps away from Natoli and host Jimmy Kimmel at the time—didn't make a peep. Natoli says he and Kimmel then left to set up a sketch, and about a minute later heard over a radio that Cullinan thought the wrong winner had been announced. Natoli radioed back asking Ruiz to open her extra Best Picture envelope. Once it was confirmed Moonlight was the winner another stage manager tried to get the accountants to go onstage—to no avail. "[Brian] wouldn’t go, and Martha wouldn’t go," Natoli says. "We had to push them on stage, which was just shocking to me." (His full interview is here.) Meanwhile, two sources tell Variety that Cullinan had pitched a sketch to Oscars producers that would have involved him and Ruiz onstage with Kimmel. PwC, however, says Cullinan was simply concerned after last year's Academy Awards, during which host Chris Rock brought three Asian-American children onstage and joked they were the PwC accountants. A PwC rep says Cullinan did discuss possible onstage appearances, but not a sketch; he just wanted to avoid being cast in "a defamatory way" again.

Original Story:  – More than 500,000 known objects are orbiting planet Earth, and around 20,000 of them are at least as big as a softball, reports NASA. Now a University College London professor has used data from space-track.org to create a video to help us visualize how quickly that space junk has accumulated thanks to space traffic and collisions, reports Wired UK. NASA notes that there have been few disastrous collisions, but it points to two recent ones—a Chinese missile test in 2007 and the collision of two satellites in 2009—that threw 5,000 items of debris into orbit. In his video, lecturer Stuart Grey first takes us back to 1957, with the launch of Sputnik 1 and the space race, reports the Orlando Sentinel. The few minor objects multiply rapidly, and he has to pan out to view the entire array. NASA says it works with the Department of Defense to maintain a "highly accurate satellite catalog on objects in Earth orbit that are larger than a softball," and Houston and Moscow mission controls work together to help avoid debris "encounters." So far, no practical way of cleaning up the junk has emerged, notes CNET. Meanwhile, about one piece of debris has fallen to Earth every day for the past 50 years.

Now it comes out that Pratt’s story about leaving The Hills to fight cyber crime is a lie. The truth? “He is leaving The Hills for six weeks because he was asked to,” a source tells Us. Pratt allegedly “flipped out” when a female producer asked him to do something, and she was so “rattled” she filed a complaint. “He got so crazy that he screamed, 'I should kill you for even asking me to do that!'" the source says, adding that Pratt was almost kicked off—but “the show agreed that Spencer would leave The Hills for six weeks to do anger management training once a week at home. If he completes it, he can return.” One person, though—supposedly Pratt's new boss—says he's serious about cyber security. Click here for that interview.

Original Story:  – It had all the makings of fraud, or at least some level of incompetence: a Kickstarter product that raised a ton of cash, didn't ship on time to backers, didn't work properly, and sent the manufacturer into bankruptcy. Not only that—it was the largest project out of Europe ever taken on by the crowdfunding site, per Consumerist. To get to the bottom of the whispering, Kickstarter hired its own investigative reporter to find out what went wrong with the Zano mini-drone. Mark Harris calls his task a most "unusual commission." He noted in a Dec. 8 Medium post that he wasn't affiliated with the Welsh company behind the drone in any way and had "no particular axe to grind." The creator, Torquing Group, raised almost $3.3 million on its original $175,000 goal, but seemed plagued by trouble from the get-go. To start with, when it came time for product to ship, pre-order customers got their drones first instead of the 12,000-plus backers who had plunked down money, Consumerist notes. Then, when customers got their drones, the devices often didn't perform. Finally, Torquing was forced to declare the European equivalent of Chapter 11 because of a litany of errors, miscalculations, and a "dangerous lack of self-awareness." But was it a scam? In a nutshell, no, though Consumerist notes "early videos may have been misleading, and no one ever saw the drones flying as promised in a demonstration … because they never did." (The longer, more fascinating answer can be found in Harris' exhaustive take on Medium.) Harris' conclusion: "Kickstarter, and other crowdfunding platforms, should reconsider the way that they deal with projects involving complex hardware, massive overfunding, or large sums of money." (Other Kickstarters that failed miserably.)
Original Summary:  A Kickstarter project for a mini-drone, Zano, raised $3.3 million but failed to deliver on its promises, leading to bankruptcy of the manufacturer. Despite initial suspicions of fraud, an investigative reporter hired by Kickstarter found that the project's creator, Torquing Group, was plagued by trouble from the start, including shipping pre-orders before backers, poor product performance, and a lack of self-awareness.

He noted in a Dec. 8 Medium post that he wasn't affiliated with the Welsh company behind the drone in any way and had "no particular axe to grind." The creator, Torquing Group, raised almost $3.3 million on its original $175,000 goal, but seemed plagued by trouble from the get-go. To start with, when it came time for product to ship, pre-order customers got their drones first instead of the 12,000-plus backers who had plunked down money, Consumerist notes. Then, when customers got their drones, the devices often didn't perform. Finally, Torquing was forced to declare the European equivalent of Chapter 11 because of a litany of errors, miscalculations, and a "dangerous lack of self-awareness." But was it a scam? In a nutshell, no, though Consumerist notes "early videos may have been misleading, and no one ever saw the drones flying as promised in a demonstration … because they never did." (The longer, more fascinating answer can be found in Harris' exhaustive take on Medium.) Harris' conclusion: "Kickstarter, and other crowdfunding platforms, should reconsider the way that they deal with projects involving complex hardware, massive overfunding, or large sums of money." (Other Kickstarters that failed miserably.)
Injected Summary:  A Kickstarter project for a mini-drone, Zano, raised $3.3 million but failed to deliver on its promises, leading to bankruptcy of the manufacturer. Despite initial suspicions of fraud, an investigative reporter hired by Kickstarter found that the project's creator, Torquing Group, was plagued by trouble from the start, including shipping pre-orders before backers, poor product performance, and a lack of self-awareness.

Original Story:  – While America might more typically worry about what its youth are doing, Japan spends a lot of time worrying about what they're not doing, and what they're not doing is having sex—at all, apparently. A new government survey suggests that the country's millennials are not only in no hurry to marry, but apparently aren't in any rush to do the deed. To wit, a whopping 44% of women and 42% of men, amounting to nearly half of the country's millennial singles ages 18 to 34, say they are still virgins, reports the Washington Post. But the percentage of these singles who say they hope to marry in the future is up close to 90%. "People marry later or stay single for life, contributing to the nation’s low birthrate," the head researcher tells the Japan Times. "They want to tie the knot eventually, but they tend to put it off as they have gaps between their ideals and the reality." With an aging generation of baby boomers weighing down what is already the world's oldest population, Japan has for years been trying to encourage its dwindling number of young people to marry and have children. But complicating this quandary, CNN reports that the apparent lack of interest in engaging in actual sex could result in part from the country's many manga fans choosing fantasy over reality. Plus more women are making more money and choosing to marry later or not at all, while many men report feeling intimidated by them. "They feel threatened by women who are empowering themselves," one expert says. (A quarter of young men and almost half of young women in Japan go so far as to say they despise sexual contact.)
Original Summary:  According to a new government survey, nearly half of Japan's millennial singles aged 18-34 are virgins, with 44% of women and 42% of men reporting that they have not had sex. Despite this, 87% of these singles hope to marry in the future, highlighting a disconnect between their ideals and reality.

Original Story:  – A California woman apparently befriended a homeless woman, allowed the woman to sleep in her car, and then continued to drive the car—for months—after the homeless woman died. Police don’t suspect foul play, but are not sure why the woman didn’t report the death—which could have occurred anywhere from three to 10 months ago, the Los Angeles Times reports. The body was only discovered when officers responded to reports of an illegally parked vehicle. They found the woman “in a mummified state.” “In our profession, right when you get to that point where you think you've seen it all, something else comes along that says, 'Well, I guess I've seen something else that I'd never expected,'” an officer tells AOL News. “It’s definitely one of the more bizarre things that I've come across."

Original Story:  – Janet Napolitano is officially headed for an exit on stage left, which invites the question of who will succeed her at Homeland Security. Politico and the Daily Beast round up some of the frontrunners to be the sprawling department's fourth leader: NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly: Chuck Schumer has already called Obama's chief of staff to put in a good word for Kelly, calling New York's loss, the "nation's gain." Pete King praised his ability "to fight bureaucratic battles." Joe Lieberman: The Senate's former Homeland Security chair would be a strong contender, but says the "timing is not right." He just took a job at a New York law firm; he's also not going to win popularity contests in the Obama administration. Still, he's not ruling it out and he's well-versed in counterterrorism. Former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig: The Beast calls Danzig a "dark horse candidate," but he narrowly missed being named Defense secretary, is closely tied to the Obama administration, and currently advises Homeland Security and Defense on terrorism and bio-defense. TSA chief John Pistole: He's taken heat for the White House, and he's a former deputy FBI director. Former Coast Guard commandant Thad Allen: Won high praise for his handling of the BP oil spill.
Original Summary:  Janet Napolitano is leaving her position as Secretary of Homeland Security, and several potential successors are being considered, including NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, Sen.

Original Story:  – The owners of a pizza shop in Pakistan say business is booming now that they've introduced a robot waitress. Osama Jafri, the engineer who designed the 55-pound robot, says it can greet customers and carry pizzas to their tables. The AP reports the robot resembles a short, slender woman wearing a long dress and apron. Jafri says he wrapped a scarf around the robot's neck so as not to offend conservative patrons. The 24-year-old says he was inspired by videos of robots in China, according to Phys.org. He says his robot waitress cost about $6,000 to build. Jafri says sales at Pizza.com, in the town of Multan, have doubled since the robot was unveiled in February. "We went to a lot of places, but my uncle said that in this restaurant a robot serves," one 12-year-old customer says. "When the robot served us pizza we felt very happy." Jafri's father Aziz, who owns the restaurant, says he has three more robot waitresses and plans to open a new branch. He says, "I used to sell pizzas, but now restaurant owners want to buy robots from me."

Original Story:  – Puerto Rico is still struggling weeks after two powerful hurricanes last month—the territory's Electric Power Authority said Wednesday morning that power service was at 25%—but, thanks to Tesla, electricity has been restored at a San Juan children's hospital. The company used its solar panels and batteries to create a solar array in a parking lot next to Hospital del Niño that generates all the energy the hospital needs, reports NPR, citing local media. Tesla tweeted pictures of the array this week, calling the project the "first of many solar+storage projects going live" in Puerto Rico. For now, the head of the hospital says, the setup is a donation, but a deal could eventually make it permanent after the crisis has passed. Rebuilding Puerto Rico's power grid could take months and cost as much as $5 billion, but other companies are similarly stepping in to help; Google's parent company, for example, has helped to restore internet service. Last week, the Electric Power Authority signed a contract with a small and somewhat new company to restore the power grid, causing some concern; on Wednesday, it was announced that retired Air Force Col. Noel Zamot has been appointed to oversee the grid's restoration, the AP reports. "We are deeply concerned both about why and how a small, inexperienced firm was tasked with the massive job of rebuilding Puerto Rico's devastated electrical grid," Nancy Pelosi said in a statement, praising Zamot's appointment and ability to provide additional scrutiny of the process.
Original Summary:  Tesla has provided solar panels and batteries to restore electricity to a children's hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which was previously at 25% power.

Original Story:  – A small Beechcraft BE36 aircraft crashed yesterday into a house in Plainfield, Mass., killing its pilot and two passengers but sparing the family of four inside the house, the Boston Globe reports. FAA officials say the plane had taken off from Pennsylvania's Lancaster Airport and was headed toward Massachusetts' Norwood Memorial Airport, about 20 miles from the crash site. "It went right up in flames," Mary O'Rourke, a neighbor who was sitting on her porch when the plane hit about 5:45pm, tells NBC News. "There was black smoke and ashes everywhere." Nearly 10 fire companies responded to the three-alarm call and had the fire extinguished by 8pm, the Globe notes; federal officials say a child was on board the plane. The pilot had called in engine problems about five minutes before the plane went down and indicated he was "unable to maintain altitude" or make it to a Rhode Island airport seven miles away, reports WCVB. "We've got a real bad vibration. We're losing engines," he radioed flight controllers, per the station. O'Rourke tells NBC she saw the home's occupants—two adults, a high school freshman, and a fourth-grader—run out of the home after the crash, apparently uninjured. The Massachusetts fire marshal tells NECN, "While we suffered great tragedy here … the miracle today is that four occupants of that home … were able to safely escape." Meanwhile, WCVB notes the next-door neighbor to the crash is Jeff Kinney, author of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. (A plane crash last year into a Maryland home also had tragic consequences.)

Original Story:  – After a career-ending injury, Russian ballerina Dominika becomes a seductive spy in Red Sparrow, a Francis Lawrence-directed film based on Jason Matthews' novel. Starring Jennifer Lawrence, it's a bloody affair that might not be worth its 2.5-hour run time, based on what critics are saying. It had a 52% positive rating among critics, and a slightly higher one from audiences: Peter Howell doesn't recommend it. At the Toronto Star, he calls Red Sparrow "the anti-007" in which "the sex is rape by any name, the tech is ancient floppy disks and the fighting is artless and bloody." Additional drawbacks are an "overly plotted screenplay," and Lawrence's "dodgy" Russian accent, "which approaches parody," Howell writes. Overall, it's "a brutal, muddled and dispiriting watch." Manohla Dargis disagrees, applauding Lawrence's ability to "slip into a role as if sliding into another skin." She delivers "a serviceable accent," but it's "her absolute ease and certainty that carry you through Red Sparrow," a "preposterously entertaining" film, Dargis writes at the New York Times, pointing out how rare it is to see a female character be the victim and perpetrator of "startling" violence. "With Cold War tensions rising again in real life, Red Sparrow feels of this time in a cool way, but only Lawrence's spy is memorable in this so-so operation," writes Brian Truitt at USA Today. "There's so much good stuff"—Dominika is "a fascinating study" and Lawrence "fits the role like a new pair of pointe shoes"—"but it never jells in a satisfying way." The film is also too long and a "hard watch due to its brutality," Truitt writes. Lawrence "gives her all," but it's not enough for Mark Kennedy, either. "What really drives Dominika is never very clear" and she ends up "like a reflection of the film itself, getting flatter and more boring by the minute," he writes at the AP. He also criticizes the "muddled" story and "cartoon violence," perhaps best exhibited in a scene involving the peeling of skin. "That might be more fun than sitting though Red Sparrow," he writes.
Original Summary:  Red Sparrow, a spy thriller directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Jennifer Lawrence, has received mixed reviews from critics.

"What really drives Dominika is never very clear" and she ends up "like a reflection of the film itself, getting flatter and more boring by the minute," he writes at the AP. He also criticizes the "muddled" story and "cartoon violence," perhaps best exhibited in a scene involving the peeling of skin. "That might be more fun than sitting though Red Sparrow," he writes.
Injected Summary:  Red Sparrow, a spy thriller directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Jennifer Lawrence, has received mixed reviews from critics. While some praise Lawrence's performance and the film's timely themes, others criticize the overly plotted screenplay, poor accents, and excessive violence, making it a "brutal and muddled" watch.

Original Story:  – In the latest unkind cut in parenting battles, startling Wisconsin health ads are warning moms and dads that sleeping with their babies is the same as leaving a butcher knife next to them. The Milwaukee horror campaign against family "co-sleeping" reveals dozing babes cuddled next to knives almost as big as they are. "Is it shocking?" asked city Health Commissioner Bevan Baker. "Yes, but what is even more shocking is that 30 developed and underdeveloped countries have better" infant death rates than Milwaukee. A 7-week-old baby died the day the campaign was launched, the ninth infant to die in the city while sleeping with a parent in a year, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But angry campaign critics say sleeping together in a family bed is a natural situation practiced throughout the world, including in nations with lower infant death rates, and is generally safe, unless a parent is drunk or on drugs. The mayor, "unable to impact a failing school system or fix high unemployment, latched on to the first headline-grabbing distraction that came along," carped the Third Coast Digest. The Washington Post refers to the ads as "jaw-dropping," and points to popular baby expert William Sears, who offers tips for safe co-sleeping on his web site. "It doesn't mention butcher knives," notes the Post.
Original Summary:  The latest anti-co-sleeping campaign in Wisconsin is warning parents that sleeping with their babies is as dangerous as leaving a butcher knife next to them, with the risk of infant death increasing to 30 in the city. Critics argue that co-sleeping is a natural and generally safe practice, except when a parent is intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, and that the campaign is a distraction from more pressing issues such as a failing school system and high unemployment.

Original Story:  – A white supremacist accused of stopping an Amtrak train in Nebraska has been charged with terrorism. Documents unsealed Wednesday in US District Court in Lincoln show 26-year-old Taylor Wilson of St. Charles, Mo., is charged with terrorism attacks and other violence against railroad carriers and mass transportation systems, the AP reports. The eastbound train with about 175 people aboard halted around 2am on Oct. 22 in Oxford, Neb., about 200 miles southwest of Omaha. Per an affidavit cited by the Lincoln Journal Star, FBI Special Agent Monte Czaplewski said the assistant conductor found Wilson sitting in the engineer's seat, "playing with the controls." That conductor and others reportedly subdued and held Wilson down until the authorities could arrive. A deputy says Wilson had a loaded revolver (he had a permit for concealed carry in Missouri), plus more ammunition and a knife. Wilson, who was traveling from Sacramento, Calif., to St. Louis, was initially charged in Furnas County with felony criminal mischief and use of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony. In an affidavit regarding the new charges, Czaplewski said there was probable cause to believe that electronic devices possessed by Wilson and firearms owned by him "have been used for or obtained in anticipation of engaging in or planning to engage in criminal offenses against the United States." Court documents show the FBI has evidence of Wilson's activities with white supremacist groups, with an informant telling the agency Wilson has previously expressed interest in "killing black people."

Original Story:  – The Super Bowl is over, but JerseyGate is in full swing. QB Tom Brady, who couldn't find his game-winning jersey after the main event Sunday, suspects it was stolen from the Patriots locker room, and now Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has called in law enforcement to track it down, the Texas Tribune reports. Both the Houston Police Department and the Texas Rangers (the agency, not the MLB team) are on the jersey's trail, per a statement. Patrick notes state pride, citing Texas' "very high value on hospitality and football," calling the jersey perhaps "the most valuable NFL collectable ever" (For the Win says it could now fetch in the seven figures), and adding, "It is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas." Meanwhile, Brady noted Monday that if the jersey pops up on eBay, "someone let me know," ESPN reports. (Men's Health lists 11 people who could've lifted the jersey.)

Original Story:  – Hurricane Matthew killed at least three people when it hit North Carolina on Saturday, the Weather Channel reports. And according to the Chicago Tribune, multiple flood warnings were issued for Raleigh, which was expecting 7 inches of rain. But that didn't stop NC State from hosting its scheduled football game against Notre Dame at Carter-Finley Stadium in Raleigh amid 20mph winds and an "endless torrential downpour," USA Today reports. The game was a "slopfest" played on a "100-yard slip and slide." Offense was basically an impossibility. At halftime, when the game was delayed due to lightning, NC State held a 3-0 lead, and its lone field goal was "celebrated like a game winner." "This is not so much a football game as a spectacle, a curiosity," the Tribune sums up. See video examples of the slopfest here and here.

Original Story:  – Justifying concerned mothers everywhere, a group of researchers believes Neanderthals could have survived the Ice Age if they'd just worn a dang jacket. According to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, dozens of ancient campsites—both human and Neanderthal—contain little evidence that Neanderthals ever figured out how to make cold-weather clothing. Humans on the other hand—well, we're still here. Remains of rabbits, foxes, minks, and wolverines were found at human campsites, Phys.org reports. Of those, wolverine is the most important. It's still used to make warm clothing by people living in the Arctic. However, no wolverine remains were found in Neanderthal camps, notes the Telegraph. Other evidence for humans unlocking the power of prehistoric North Face includes bone needles and ancient figurines that appear to be wearing furs. Meanwhile, researchers conclude Neanderthals never made it further than wearing capes, whether because they weren't smart enough or their culture stopped them from doing so. Without good cold-weather clothing, Neanderthals couldn't hunt further north, lie in wait for their prey, or spend long amounts of time away from shelter. A professor at the Natural History Museum in London calls the study "a really interesting bit of work." (Those jacket-wearing humans may have also given Neanderthals herpes.)
Original Summary:  Neanderthals may have survived the Ice Age if they had worn warm clothing, according to a study published in the Journal of Anthropological Archaeology. The study found that while humans at the time used bone needles and figurines to make warm clothing, Neanderthals did not have any evidence of making cold-weather clothing, such as wolverine remains, and were limited in their hunting and survival abilities as a result.

Original Story:  – President Trump extended a peace offering of sorts to NFL players on Friday, asking them to recommend people who’ve been unfairly treated in the criminal justice system and deserve a pardon, reports CNN. "I'm going to take a look at those applications. And if I find, and my committee finds that they are unfairly treated, then we will pardon them or at least let them out [of prison]," Trump says. He waged war last year with NFL players who kneeled during the National Anthem to protest fatal police shootings of unarmed black men and other social injustices. Longtime civil rights activist Harry Edwards was not impressed with the offer, calling it "nothing less than a cynical, self-serving ploy to create a photo op with NFL players," according to Reuters. Indeed, on Friday even as the president solicited recommendations for pardons, he railed again at players who weren't "proud enough" to stand for the anthem, and his comments came just a few days after uninviting the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House, citing the national anthem controversy. As NBC notes, pardoning a few people is not the same as criminal justice reform or addressing "systemic and racial oppression, which is another huge part of the players’ protests." One former Giants player already has someone to recommend: Kicker Lawrence Tynes said in a tweet that his brother is serving 27 years for selling pot. The president says his staff is currently examining 3,000 cases of individuals who might deserve clemency.

Original Story:  – Salman Khan's life might get significantly less glamorous. The world's ninth-highest-paid actor, who has appeared in more than 100 Bollywood films, was sentenced to five years in prison Thursday in India after being found guilty of poaching, though his lawyers intend to appeal and a bail hearing is slated for tomorrow. Khan was initially convicted of killing two blackbucks, a protected species of antelope, in 2006, some eight years after prosecutors said he shot the animals from a car while in Jodhpur to film 1998's Hum Saath Saath Hain, reports the Guardian. The car's registration number was reportedly seen by a member of the Bishnoi tribe, which views the antelope as sacred. But Khan's conviction was later suspended, per the BBC. He was then acquitted before charges were laid again. Khan was taken to jail following Thursday's verdict; four other actors in the car were acquitted for lack of evidence. The prosecution "engaged in tampering and fabricating evidence and documents as well as roping in fake witnesses to prove its case," Khan's lawyer, HM Saraswat, tells Gulf News. "It even failed to prove that the black bucks were killed by gunshots." His lawyers said Khan had only an air gun that couldn't have taken down an antelope, per CNN; Khan has suggested the animals died from overeating. Khan has other legal troubles to worry about: His 2015 acquittal in the 2002 hit-and-run death of a homeless man is being challenged in the Supreme Court, per the Guardian. (In another hunting-related story, officials are testing human excrement, hoping it belongs to a tycoon.)

A fellow rider on the Northeast Corridor line of New Jersey Transit took the video Thursday night and tweeted it. Some commenters said they were impressed by the unidentified man's shaving skills, while others felt "grossed out." NJ Transit says it prohibits bathing or shaving aboard trains and buses. Conductors can ask customers to stop and, if they refuse, the conductor can notify police. But that didn't happen Thursday. Pete Bentivenga posted the video. "I've been commuting for almost 20 years on this line and it's right up there with the strangest things I've seen for sure," he tells the Newark Star-Ledger. He says the clean-shaven man then had himself a beer. Reactions on Twitter varied from the annoyed ("Somebody donate this man an electric razor!") to the disgusted ("Clipping nails on the train/subway/desk at work is my irrational pet peeve. This would have put me over the edge") to the seen-it-all-before shrug ("Taking the connection at Long Branch to Bayhead on a weekday will guarantee like 10 of these interactions").

Nor are police shedding light on a possible motive, disclosing only that one of the two men—James White, 38, and Justin Mann, 24— knew one of the victims, reports the Albany Times Union. Killed were Shanta Myers, 36; her children, 11-year-old Jeremiah and 5-year-old Shanise; and her partner, Brandi Mells, 22. There might have been one more victim, but Myers' 15-year-old son, Isaiah Smith, was out of town when the murders took place. Now, a GoFundMe page has raised more than $40,000 to pay for a scholarship for the teen, as well as to cover funeral expenses. Both men face charges of first-degree murder, which could see them sent to prison for life without the possibility of parole. White received 11 years in state prison in 2000 for first-degree manslaughter, while Mann got 5 years in 2010 for first-degree robbery, reports the Daily Gazette. Police sources tell the Times Union that footage from security cameras around Troy led to the arrests. That raises the possibility that the Schenectady men used public transportation because local buses have high-res video cameras. The four victims were found bound in their basement apartment, with their throats slashed.

A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services explained that they were "anticipating high demand and the fact that consumers may be enrolling from multiple time zones." The original deadline was actually a week ago, the AP points out, but it was pushed back amidst the site's glitches. "It's just nonstop now. Everybody knows about it. Everybody wants it," a Florida enrollment counselor said. But if you miss the deadline don't panic; the government is trying to talk insurers into covering even the true procrastinators who sign up in the middle of January as though they'd been signed up since New Year's, and even if those companies refuse, you have until March 31 to sign up before facing a penalty.
Original Summary:  The Obama administration has extended the deadline to sign up for a healthcare plan by 24 hours due to high demand and technical issues with the website. Despite missing the original deadline, individuals can still sign up for coverage in the middle of January and may be eligible for coverage without a penalty if insurance companies agree to cover them.

Original Story:  – Shares for the parent company of MoviePass plunged Monday, dropping 60% to close at $0.80 and prompting Forbes to make a dire prediction: "The end is near" for the subscription service, which was charging users $9.95 per month for the ability to see a movie a day in theaters. In an emergency move last week, Helios and Matheson put in place a 1-for-250 reverse stock split and borrowed $5 million to keep things afloat, as it had depleted funds to pay theaters for tickets. The low closing price is notable because a company can be delisted from Nasdaq if its stock stays below $1 for a certain number of consecutive days. Deadline notes the company's cash-flow problem led to outages on the MoviePass app over the weekend, specifically for subscribers trying to buy tickets for Mission Impossible: Fallout. And not including major movie releases on the service may be the indefinite future: Business Insider reports that at an "all-hands meeting" on Monday, MoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe announced that The Meg and Christopher Robin, coming out in theaters in early August, wouldn't be available to subscribers through the app. In a letter Friday, Lowe also said that subscribers wanting to see films "in high demand on Opening Weekend" would have to pay a surcharge—what he calls "Peak Pricing," and which a MoviePass rep told Quartz earlier this month could mean a surcharge of between $2 and $6. Lowe also noted that "as we continue to evolve the service, certain movies may not always be available in every theater on our platform." Some users are calling this all a bait and switch, per the Washington Post, which calls the service's moves "another step toward the abyss."

Original Story:  – Police officers stumbled upon a meth lab in an unlikely spot Monday: a sewer beneath a Walmart parking lot in a Buffalo suburb. Authorities say officers discovered the lab, which is believed to have still been active, on a routine patrol in Amherst, per the Buffalo News. Officials in hazmat suits eventually removed aerosol spray cans, chemicals, plastic bottles, and suspected methamphetamine from the sewer, which was tall enough to stand up in, reports WIVB. No suspects were found, though police plan to review surveillance footage. A resident says the discovery is "unbelievable" for the area.

Original Story:  – Toyota has introduced an odd new product, and no, it's not a car. The Japan-based automotive manufacturer just unveiled the Kirobo Mini, a small, humanoid robot designed to "invoke an emotional connection," according to chief design engineer Fuminori Kataoka. Toyota's robot is one of a "growing list" of companion devices coming out in the country, which is suffering population contraction due to a plethora of social factors, including a general lack of interest in marriage and children among young Japanese, Reuters reports. With a lack of caretakers for an increasingly elderly population, the country is turning to robots to fill the gap. The Kirobo Mini itself doesn't offer any functionality beyond companionship, though the palm-sized robot "wobbles a bit, and this is meant to emulate a seated baby, which hasn't fully developed the skills to balance itself," Kataoka says. It also comes with a "cradle" of sorts, designed to fit in the cupholder of one's car. According to Digital Trends, the Kirobo Mini was inspired by a larger robot Toyota made as a companion for a Japanese astronaut aboard the ISS. Toyota's betting the concept will be a hit down here on Earth, too, and it must be confident, as the device is priced at a whopping 39,800 yen (roughly $392), plus a $3 monthly subscription. The device will go on sale next year in Japan. (Robots tried to write a Beatles song, and kind of pulled it off.)

Original Story:  – In November came the news that German tax inspectors investigating an elderly loner in 2012 uncovered a cache of 1,406 works, at least some since confirmed to have been looted by the Nazis, stashed amid expired cans of food in the man's squalid Munich apartment. That man, Cornelius Gurlitt, had more than just hundreds of paintings: He had a second home two hours away, in Salzburg, Austria, and in it, dozens more paintings, including works by Monet and Picasso. Most of the info on the latest revelation is coming not from officials—a German prosecutor had no comment, and Austrian officials say they're unaware of the case and haven't issued any search warrants related to it, reports the BBC—but from a rep for Gurlitt. The rep says the works are being analyzed to determine if they were stolen, but "after an initial assessment that suspicion is not confirmed." Authorities "viewed and secured" the art yesterday, the Los Angeles Times reports by way of local media without specifying who those authorities are. The Wall Street Journal says the art never passed through police custody, and is in a depository, and Gurlitt's rep says the work left the home at the request of Gurlitt's legal guardian. Of the works found in Gurlitt's Munich apartment, 380 have been identified as Nazi-seized; he inherited them in 1956 from his father, a well-known Nazi-era art dealer.

Original Story:  – President Obama will make an unconventional Cabinet pick today, naming REI Equipment Inc. CEO Sally Jewell as his new secretary of the Interior, a source tells the Washington Post. Jewell has had an interesting career path: She started out as an engineer for Mobil Oil, then became a commercial banker, before finally landing her spot at REI. She has little policy experience, though she has occasionally dipped her toe into politics, introducing Obama at the White House's 2011 Great Outdoors Initiative and taking part in Obama's 2009 CEO health care summit. But Jewell isn't a partisan Democrat; she made a high-profile appearance in support of John McCain in 2008. The pick is also unusual, the Post points out, because the Interior secretary position is often reserved for a Western politician. But Jewell would give Obama another woman in his Cabinet, countering critics who complained that his early second-term nominees were all men.

Original Story:  – Amid the fallout from the release of the GOP-produced memo on alleged FBI surveillance overreach, House Democrats are pushing for the release of their own memo. Democrats, who are expected to call for a vote in a Monday afternoon meeting of the House Intelligence Committee, say their document will serve as a rebuttal to claims in the GOP document and adds context to the FBI and DOJ decision to wiretap former Trump aide Carter Page, the New York Times reports. The GOP-controlled committee voted against releasing the Democratic memo at the same time as the Republican memo, but they now say they're willing to release it, which would require the approval of President Trump. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer urged Trump on Sunday to approve the release of the memo, saying failure to do so would "confirm the American people's worst fears that the release of Chairman Nunes' memo was only intended to undermine Special Counsel Bob Mueller's investigation," CNN reports. Republican sources, meanwhile, tell Axios that there are several more memos to come detailing "areas of concern," including political bias and possible efforts to aid Hillary Clinton's campaign, at agencies including the FBI and the State Department, and that releasing them won't require the same extensive declassification procedure as the Russia memo. House Intelligence Committee chief Rep. Devin Nunes said Friday that they are now in "phase two" of their investigation.

The Mohave County Sheriff's Office said Sunday that a boat carrying 10 people and another vessel with six people on board collided head-on after dark Saturday night on the river that borders California and Arizona. Authorities say both boats sank, throwing everyone aboard into the water; passing boaters helped pull victims from the water, though the search had to be called off at 9pm local time. It resumed early Monday. One person was found in critical condition and flown to a hospital in Las Vegas. Nine others were taken to local hospitals by ambulance. Authorities are searching for four people who remain missing. Anita Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the Mohave County Sheriff's Office, says none of the boaters were wearing life vests when the collision occurred. The crash happened in Moabi Regional Park, a popular water recreation area along the border about 290 miles east of Los Angeles. The area was packed with people celebrating ahead of Labor Day, notes ABC News.

He also went on the Ellen DeGeneres Show today to make his case, reports People. "I don't know if any of you noticed, but there is some racial tension here and there," he said. "I felt like when we were writing this song it wasn't necessarily up to the media … or talk radio or anything like that to deal with that anymore. I think it's music's turn to have the conversation." Sample lyrics: "[I'm] just a proud rebel son with an ol' can of worms/Lookin' like I got a lot to learn." To which LL Cool J replies: "If you don't judge my do-rag … I won't judge your red flag/If you don't judge my gold chains … I'll forget the iron chains." And a sample of the back and forth: It's racist, writes Ta-Nehisi Coates at the Atlantic. For one thing, Paisley picked LL Cool J for this? Lots of rappers (Chuck D, KRS-ONE, etc.) have spent their careers trying to have a conversation about racism, but LL isn't one of them.

Original Story:  – Sean Spicer is being hit with a wave of criticism—the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect is even calling for his firing—after he said Hitler wasn't that bad compared to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, at least in one specific area. "Hitler didn't even sink to the level of using chemical weapons," Vox quotes the press secretary as saying during a press conference Tuesday. CNN reports there was an "audible gasp" from reporters following the comment. Understandable, because Hitler, in fact, used gas to kill millions of Jews in the Holocaust. He also used gas to kill disabled people and other groups. Spicer only dug himself deeper when he attempted to clarify what he meant. "He was not using the gas on his own people in the same way that Assad is doing," Spicer said. "He brought them into Holocaust centers, I understand that." That clarification managed to invent a new term for concentration camps and possibly imply that German Jews were not real Germans. Spicer finally specified that he meant Hitler didn't use chemical weapons on the battlefield, USA Today reports. Despite insisting he wasn't "trying to lessen the horrendous nature of the Holocaust," the Anne Frank Center is accusing Spicer of Holocaust denial. Spicer's original point, now firmly buried by his invocation of Hitler, was that Russia shouldn't continue to support Assad.

ABC News reports the 18-year-old was "hit," and Ignacio Valencia of Houston, who was shot in the arms, says he was with her when she died. "I was just in shock and I just couldn't move," he says. "Her last words to me [were], 'I don't feel anything. I don't feel anything.'" Like her brother, Valencia describes Ibarra as a provider for her single mother and two younger siblings who was studying to become a teacher. No other details about Ibarra's death have been released. The four other victims have been identified as Rafael Penaloza Vega and Geovanni Ruiz Murillo, both of Mexico; BPM staff member Daniel Pessina of Italy; and Canadian Kirk Wilson, a 49-year-old security officer and father of two, per the AP. Officials say fifteen others were injured, including four Americans. Eight have now been released from hospital. It isn't clear who among them was shot or trampled. The gunman—who officials say entered the club and began exchanging gunfire with another person—is believed to have escaped. However, three people were arrested near the club after another shooting; officials are trying to determine if the two shootings were related.

Original Story:  – Fear the Bieber! Or at least the wrath of Justin Bieber fans—especially if you had the misfortune of beating the young heartthrob at last night's Grammy Awards. Angry fans of the Bieb ran wild on Esperanza Spalding's Wikipedia page after the talented but less-well-known singer won the Best New Artist award, Gawker reports. Among the many changes Spalding found: her middle name changed to "Quesadilla"; she won the Grammy "by stealing it from Justin Bieber"; and, perhaps most poetically, "SHE IS F****** REATARD." If you'd like some un-vandalized, and likely more coherent, facts about Spalding—click here.

Original Story:  – The settlement deal in Tom Selleck's very own Watergate was finalized last night, with the actor agreeing to cough up $21,685.55—the cost of the PI hired by California's Calleguas Municipal Water District to investigate Selleck's alleged water-pilfering from the district, the AP reports. The district board voted 3-0 last night in a closed session to accept the deal, which also mandates that Selleck stop having Calleguas water brought to his Hidden Valley ranch, the Los Angeles Times notes. A statement from Selleck's lawyer said the Magnum, PI actor was "pleased" with the agreement, though there were still some discrepancies between Selleck's story and that of the water district, per the newspaper. "Mr. Selleck did not receive any notifications prior to last week stating that he was acting outside of regulations decreed by the county," the statement read, adding that Selleck had "previously paid for all the water that he utilized, which the Calleguas Municipal Water District acknowledged had not been stolen." But the district said it sent cease-and-desist letters to Selleck in 2013, and Calleguas' general manager says that even if Selleck had paid for the water, it's still illegal to transport water from one district to another—and that residents outside the district don't pay taxes and other fees that go toward the water infrastructure's upkeep. "The water delivered and used in this case was not fully paid for, period," she says.

Original Story:  – Motorists in the Saudi capital this morning morning may have spotted something rarer than the Arabian unicorn: female drivers. Activists say brave women around the country got behind the wheel before dawn today in a protest against the kingdom's ban on women driving. Despite a heavy police presence, some women managed to drive around Riyadh without incident, a protest organizer tells AP. There is no written law in Saudi Arabia saying women can't drive, but the ban comes from religious edicts by clerics. One activist who posted a video on YouTube of herself driving was jailed for a week last month and forced to sign a pledge not to drive again. "We have a saying," she told CNN before her detention. "The rain starts with a single drop. This is a symbolic thing."

Original Story:  – Following Chuck Hagel's exit as defense secretary, the obvious question is who might replace him. One leading possibility: former undersecretary of defense for policy Michèle Flournoy—the defense department's highest-ranking woman ever, ABC News reports. She stepped down in 2012 and now heads a nonpartisan national security think tank thought to have played a big role in President Obama's policymaking, the Washington Post reports. Some administration officials, however, believe she has sided too readily with the uniformed military, which could lead to disagreements with the president, the Post notes. But her perceived hawkishness could play well with Republicans during the Senate confirmation process, Politico reports, and she was on Obama's shortlist the last time around. Other top names in the running: Former deputy defense secretary Ashton Carter oversaw budgeting amid tough times for the Pentagon between 2011 and 2013, ABC notes. He was a Rhodes scholar and Harvard professor, the Post reports, but he hasn't been hugely influential politically. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island is set to be the Democrats' top official on the Armed Services Committee. He recently won re-election and became known after criticizing the handling of the Iraq War in a response to a State of the Union speech by George W. Bush. But he doesn't want the Pentagon job, says a rep: He "loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island." Robert Work is currently in the No. 2 position at the Pentagon, Politico notes. The retired Marine colonel has dealt extensively with the department's budget, the Post notes, and he has headed the same think tank Flournoy now leads. And Politico raises the possibility that the likes of former generals David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal could get the job. Both faced scandals before leaving their posts, but "they command a lot of respect with the military as well as with the Republicans," and they "worked with (the) Obama administration," says an analyst.

Original Story:  – Looks like it's "super-PAC" payback time for Newt Gingrich. A pro-Newt super PAC is planning to air a 27-minute video in South Carolina attacking Mitt Romney as a ruthless corporate raider whose firm put thousands of Americans out of work, NBC News reports. Titled "King of Bain: When Mitt Romney Came to Town," the film was produced by a former Romney adviser who had actually sought work on Mitt's 2012 campaign. “I have no idea what happened here,” a former associate says. As for the film, it talks to workers who lost their jobs and faced home foreclosures after Bain Capital—a private equity firm Romney helped start—acquired companies and forced layoffs. "This is not capitalism. This is predatory,” says a senior adviser of Winning Our Future, the PAC that won a bidding war for the film yesterday. A Romney rep calls it "puzzling to see Speaker Gingrich and his supporters continue their attacks on free enterprise."

Original Story:  – Eric Holder dismissed the likes of Donald Sterling and Cliven Bundy and their very public brouhahas, and focused on "policies that disenfranchise specific groups" as "more pernicious than hateful rants." His commencement speech yesterday at Baltimore's Morgan State University marked his most pointed commentary on race since early in his tenure when he controversially derided the US as a "nation of cowards," reports the LA Times. "A criminal justice system that treats groups of people differently—and punishes them unequally—has a much more negative impact than misguided words that we can reject out of hand." Holder hammered the point over and over again, contending that "the greatest threats do not announce themselves in screaming headlines." He also swiped at the Supreme Court's recent decision on affirmative action, citing Sonia Sotomayor's dissent that we must not "wish away, rather than confront" racism. His comments came on the 60th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. The Washington Post has a complete transcript.

Original Story:  – How much would you pay for a piece of mold? If your answer is "nothing," it may surprise you to know that someone else's answer was $14,617. A patch of green bacteria encased in a round glass dish sold for that sum to an unnamed buyer at a London auction on Wednesday, the AP reports. The furry sample's case is signed on the back by Alexander Fleming, the scientist who sourced the world's first life-saving antibiotic from Penicillium chrysogenum in 1928. His inscription describes this sample as "the mould that first made penicillin"—which may not quite be so, the AP notes, since the Scottish-born doctor produced many such medallions. The payday for Fleming's niece, who sold the sample, was substantially higher than the predicted sale price of $5,000. But it may have been a relative bargain for the buyer. Pfizer paid many times that—$51,000 in today's dollars—in 1996 for a similar blob, Quartz reports. Once thought to be rare, it turns out many samples exist, made by Fleming and gifted to notables such as Winston Churchill, Pope Pius XII, and Marlene Dietrich "almost as a kind of holy relic," a rep for Bonham's auction house tells the AP. Not everyone was happy to receive one. Queen Elizabeth's husband reportedly griped about getting "another one of these bloody things," notes Quartz. More bits of trivia: Smithsonian reports Fleming made "microbial art paintings," and the AP reports that after Oxford scientists refined Fleming's discovery, penicillin production was put into high gear in preparation for D-Day in 1944. (NASA has lost its fight over this mistakenly auctioned space treasure.)

Original Story:  – Jacqueline Gomez was already acting "different" shortly before she left Aldine ISD's prom Friday night, says close friend Justice Gonzalez. "She was stuttering, not talking clear. Her eyes were low, like she was dizzy." The next morning, her date found the 17-year-old dead in their Houston motel room. Seven hours later, "he was posting pictures of himself crying on Instagram," Gonzalez tells the Houston Chronicle. So she texted him to ask what happened to Gomez; Gonzalez let the newspaper see the messages. They read in part: "They [likely law enforcement officials] said she overdosed. I woke up. I tried waking her but she wouldn't. I was screaming and crying telling her to wake up. But she didn't. She didn't." The texts, interspersed with frowning and crying emoticons, add that Gomez was "perfectly fine and happy" when they left the prom and "happy" when they went to sleep, but that they drank alcohol—and Gomez also took hydrocodone. "I shoulda took them away and flushed em," he texted, adding that he didn't know where she had gotten the painkiller or how many pills she had taken. But Gomez's friends and family insist she was no "party girl," and Gonzalez says she never saw her take drugs or talk about taking them. She adds that Gomez's date "was a couple of years older ... I remember telling her to be careful when she started to leave." Meanwhile, Gomez's mother tells KHOU her daughter was not supposed to go to the hotel after prom. Gomez's date's mom picked them up from the dance and asked Gomez's mom, via phone, if Gomez could spend the night at their house. "I said no, bring her back home," says Gomez's mom. But her daughter never arrived—and police say it was Gomez's date's mother who booked the hotel room for her son. The results of the autopsy are likely weeks out.

Original Story:  – US employers went on a hiring binge last month, adding 313,000 jobs, the most since July 2016, and drawing hundreds of thousands of people into the job market, per the AP. The figure of 313,000 easily surpassed the 205,000 economists had predicted, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Labor Department says wage gains, meanwhile, fell from the previous month to 2.6% year-over-year growth. Strong hourly wage growth had spooked markets in February because it raised the specter of inflation. But January's figure was revised one-tenth of a point lower to 2.8%. The influx of new workers kept the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.1%. The surge of job gains likely reflects burgeoning confidence among businesses that the Trump administration's tax cuts will accelerate growth. Consumers are also optimistic, likely because after-tax income grew at the fastest pace in a year last month, aided by the tax cuts. The biggest job gains were in construction (61,000), retail and professional and business services (50,000 each), manufacturing (31,000), and financial activities (28,000), per CNBC.
Original Summary:  US employers added 313,000 jobs in February, the most since July 2016, with hundreds of thousands of people entering the job market. Despite a slowdown in wage growth to 2.6% year-over-year, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.1% due to the influx of new workers.

The figure of 313,000 easily surpassed the 205,000 economists had predicted, reports the Wall Street Journal. The Labor Department says wage gains, meanwhile, fell from the previous month to 2.6% year-over-year growth. Strong hourly wage growth had spooked markets in February because it raised the specter of inflation. But January's figure was revised one-tenth of a point lower to 2.8%. The influx of new workers kept the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.1%. The surge of job gains likely reflects burgeoning confidence among businesses that the Trump administration's tax cuts will accelerate growth. Consumers are also optimistic, likely because after-tax income grew at the fastest pace in a year last month, aided by the tax cuts. The biggest job gains were in construction (61,000), retail and professional and business services (50,000 each), manufacturing (31,000), and financial activities (28,000), per CNBC.
Injected Summary:  US employers added 313,000 jobs in February, the most since July 2016, with hundreds of thousands of people entering the job market. Despite a slowdown in wage growth to 2.6% year-over-year, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.1% due to the influx of new workers.

Original Story:  – Southern Kansas and Oklahoma are experiencing small, daily quakes linked with fracking that make a larger and more destructive earthquake much more likely, according to a new, unpublished federal study. The risk remains low—about a 1 in 2,500 years' chance—but if true, it ranks the region among top-risk areas east of the Rocky Mountains, the AP reports. Those areas include Charleston, SC, and New Madrid, Missouri, which both suffered serious earthquakes during the past 200 years. "The more small earthquakes we have, it just simply increases the odds we're going to have a more damaging event," said geophysicist William Ellsworth after presenting the study to a science association. A Kansas geological official responded with, "We are worried about this, no question about it." Meanwhile, another study says that hidden geological faults in Oklahoma are ready to to burst—including ones that were just discovered and may damage vital structures, LiveScience reports. Published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, the study located faults by looking at more than 3,600 recent earthquakes in Oklahoma. "These faults are all in rock layers that existed when the dinosaurs were around," says study author Daniel McNamara. "Some of them haven't been active since then." On the bright side, a third study shows that fewer faults in Montana and the Dakotas—also drilling "hotbeds"—are ready to pop, and Ellsworth says the rate of man-made quakes has actually dropped in some "fracking states," like Arkansas and Ohio. (Is the eastern US also due for a "big one"?)

Original Story:  – Almost three years after Japan's triple disaster, there has been yet another leak at the Fukushima nuclear plant, seriously shaking public confidence in the ongoing cleanup and containment effort. In the latest leak—the biggest since last August—around 100 metric tons of highly contaminated water overflowed from a tank after an error that was only detected when a worker patrolling the area spotted water coming from a drain, Reuters reports. Tokyo Electric Power Company says the tainted water is being absorbed into the ground and it is unlikely that any of it will reach the ocean, reports CNN, which notes that the company has long struggled to contain the huge amount of radioactive water at the site. The amount of contaminated water at the devastated plant is growing by 400 tons a day, and Tepco had admitted that it won't be able to complete the purification process this year, even with three units working, Japan News finds.

Original Story:  – Hamid Karzai has delayed the inauguration of Afghanistan’s newly elected parliament, at the behest of a court he appointed himself to hear complaints from losing candidates largely loyal to him. Those candidates complain that fraud and security concerns excluded many people from the vote. But Karzai’s international allies insist the election was legitimate, and say the court he appointed to handle disputes is unconstitutional. Diplomats spent yesterday imploring Karzai to instate the new lawmakers on Sunday as scheduled. It didn't work, but the lawmakers say they plan to convene anyway, notes the Wall Street Journal. Karzai’s been ruling by fiat since the election, something that makes the West nervous. “We cannot afford a country without a Parliament,” one diplomat tells the New York Times. “For Western taxpayers who are hungry for good news, this looks awful.” But instating the election’s winners has its dangers, too. Most of those allegedly excluded from the vote were Pashtuns in the war-torn south, and the losing candidates argue that excluding them will drive more people to the Taliban.

Original Story:  – She may sport what appear to be whisker lines across her expressionless face, but the iconic Hello Kitty may not be a cat. In fact, the cartoon character created 40 years ago has a whole backstory that will soon be on display at an exhibit at the Japanese American National Museum in LA, reports the Los Angeles Times in an interview with one of the curators. For starters, Kitty White is her proper name, she's a third-grade girl from outside of London, she has a twin sister (they're Scorpios), she loves apple pie, and she has a pet cat named Charmmy Kitty. And oh yeah, she's not (exactly) a cat. The revelation, which has since been walked back a bit, made headlines: Writes the LA Times' Carolina Miranda in her own report, "I grew up with Hello Kitty everything and all I have to say is, MIND BLOWN." Over at the Washington Post, Alexandra Petri sums up typical reaction: "If you were wondering whether everything is a lie, the answer is: yes. Everything is a lie." Hello Kitty creator Sanrio confirmed the news to an incredulous Time reporter and included her official bio, which features this gem: "As tall as five apples, and as heavy as three, Hello Kitty is a bright little girl with a heart of gold." But after the uproar, the story changed a bit: RocketNews24 called Sanrio's PR department, and the person who answered said, "We never said she was a human," explaining that she's a "personification or anthropomorphization"—not quite human, but also not quite cat. Kotaku got a similar response from Sanrio's Tokyo HQ: "Hello Kitty was done in the motif of a cat. It's going too far to say that Hello Kitty is not a cat. Hello Kitty is a personification of a cat." The site notes that the original story used the word "girl," not "human." Either way, the upcoming exhibit is set to include hundreds of pieces of Hello Kitty art, merchandise, and fashion, including the famous Lady Gaga dress, and will be followed two weeks later by the inaugural Hello Kitty Con at the Museum of Contemporary Art. (Meanwhile, a 5-year-old girl was suspended from school for her apparently menacing talk about her Hello Kitty bubble shooter.)

Suggesting that the reported 3,000 extra Puerto Rico deaths—a number President Trump is heavily disputing—may have been byproducts of Hurricane Maria beyond anyone's control, he said on NBC's Meet the Press: "There’s all kinds of studies on this that we take a look at. Spousal abuse goes through the roof. You can’t blame spousal abuse after a disaster on anybody." Asked about byproduct deaths, Long says they may happen "because people have heart attacks due to stress, they fall off their house trying to fix their roof," or die driving through "intersections where the stop lights aren't working."

Original Story:  – The man accused of driving a van into worshippers near a London mosque early Monday has been named as 47-year-old Darren Osborne—a man described as "aggressive," "strange," "cuckoo," and "a bloody psycho" by neighbors in Cardiff, Wales. Witnesses say Osborne shouted "I want to kill all Muslims" after the attack, which left one person dead and 11 injured, the Guardian reports. Neighbors say he was always troublesome but his behavior had deteriorated in recent weeks and he had been thrown out of a local pub over the weekend for "cursing Muslims and saying he would do some damage." He also allegedly abused a 10-year-old Muslim neighbor, telling him he was "inbred." Osborne's sister tells the Evening Standard that he was "troubled," but was so unpolitical she doubts he knows who the country's prime minister is. Neighbors say Osborne had split up with the mother of his four children in recent weeks and had been living in a tent he put up in woodland or sometimes in the backyard of the home they used to share. Police believe he rented the van used in the attack on Sunday and drove the 150 miles to London, the Telegraph reports. After the Finsbury Park attack, he was restrained by bystanders, with an imam convincing people to stop hitting him. Police say Osborne is being held on suspicion of terrorist offenses and attempted murder.

"We're glad the White House has reached out and asked for a second meeting," Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement, per CNN. "We hope the President will go into this meeting with an open mind, rather than deciding that an agreement can't be reached beforehand." Pelosi and Schumer said they need to reach a deal that includes funding for community health centers, disaster relief, and the Children's Health Insurance Program as well as boosting military spending, the Guardian reports. "We must also come together on a bipartisan deal to pass the DREAM Act along with tough border security measures," they said. "There is a bipartisan path forward on all of these items." After they pulled out of last week's meeting, Trump, sitting between two empty chairs, slammed them as "all talk" and "no action." The current temporary spending bill expires at midnight Friday and Republicans are likely to need Democratic help to pass a replacement, though Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says a shutdown "is just not going to happen."

Original Story:  – After police in Manhattan found a 61-year-old man dead in a parked car in late August, they identified him as Geoffrey Corbis and said it appeared he died of natural causes. Turns out, his name was actually Geoffrey Weglarz, and he died by suicide after ingesting poison he bought on the dark web. How Weglarz came to this end under a different name is the subject of a fascinating New York Times story by Michael Wilson. A friend says Weglarz "had it all"—a wife and son, a big house in Connecticut, a passion for acting, and a career in software design that took him around the world. Then came the divorce and Weglarz's departure from Dell in 2011. (The Connecticut Post also mentions medical and mental health issues.) Two years later, Weglarz told PBS' Newshour in a story about jobless older Americans that he'd applied to 481 jobs with no luck, and had only $2,000 to his name. And another bad turn: Weglarz was accused of throwing a sandwich at a pregnant McDonald's worker in 2013, and he changed his surname to Corbis to avoid unflattering news reports. He never did shake his financial struggles. Shortly before he died, he told his sister he'd acquired poison used for euthanasia. "That way, when I'm ready, I can go painlessly and fast," he reportedly said. She thought she knew the outcome when Weglarz sent her a text shortly before 6pm on Aug. 24. "Stuff does taste as bad as I thought it would," it read. The Times has more, including on a final, vain bank visit. (A suicide pact is suspected in another NYC case.)

Original Story:  – Apple is working on a less-expensive iPhone that could be out later this year, reports the Wall Street Journal. The report doesn't say how cheap it might be, only that Apple would bring down costs by making the body out of plastic instead of aluminum and using more recycled parts. The Journal sees the move, which it emphasizes has not been finalized, as a "big shift" in strategy in the post-Steve-Jobs world, one made necessary by Apple's slipping market share in the smartphone market. This is all unconfirmed, reminds the Next Web, though "it’s rare to see such an unflinching statement without some truth being involved." And the Verge notes that the Journal has a solid track record on Apple scoops.
Original Summary:  Apple is reportedly working on a less expensive iPhone model, possibly to be released later this year, by using plastic instead of aluminum for the body and incorporating more recycled parts. This move is seen as a significant shift in strategy for the company in the post-Steve Jobs era, as it seeks to regain market share in the highly competitive smartphone market.

Please focus on relevant details, only answer with the summary.– Apple is working on a less-expensive iPhone that could be out later this year, reports the Wall Street Journal. The report doesn't say how cheap it might be, only that Apple would bring down costs by making the body out of plastic instead of aluminum and using more recycled parts. The Journal sees the move, which it emphasizes has not been finalized, as a "big shift" in strategy in the post-Steve-Jobs world, one made necessary by Apple's slipping market share in the smartphone market. This is all unconfirmed, reminds the Next Web, though "it’s rare to see such an unflinching statement without some truth being involved." And the Verge notes that the Journal has a solid track record on Apple scoops.

Original Story:  – On any given day there are 80,000 people missing, the FBI estimates, while the list of unidentified deceased people is some 10,000 Jane and John Does long. Some cases are cold, while others are in "deep freeze," reports Reveal, the publishing arm of the Center for Investigative Reporting, which submitted dozens of state and local agency records requests, conducted more than 100 interviews with experts and the families of missing people and victims, and examined thousands of pages of case files from across the country. "[This] is something that’s going to need our attention forever," said Michael Murphy, who runs the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children's unknown victims unit. "It’s not something we can just throw a little bit of resources at and think it’s going to go away.” Reveal reports that 1,881 cases in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) were labeled homicides as of June; 5,517 cases involved unknown manners of death; and as of Aug. 1, 916 were children and young adult Jane and John Does. These unsolved cases involve a possible perpetrator on the loose. Since 2007, NamUs, with help from the Justice Department, runs a database that operates much like a dating site in an attempt to connect families with bodies. DNA, physical descriptions, photos, dates people went missing all help connect the dots. Even members of the public can search, but the system often goes unused due, Reveal reports, to "neglect, indifference and a lack of will by many state and local authorities—police, medical examiners and others."

Original Story:  – Like viewing secretive military bases? Google Maps has long shown the Tonopah Test Range in southwestern Nevada, but didn't update that image for eight years—so two guys bought satellite imagery of the location and questioned Google about the apparent oversight, LiveScience reports. "Why did you allow the coverage of an experimental military base on US soil to lapse on your mapping platform for eight years?" write Brendan Byrne and Dhruve Mehrotra on Motherboard. "Do you have a tacit agreement with the US government to keep this area off of Google Maps?" The old image remained due to lack of interest in the location, says a Google rep, but either way, the story reveals something about photographing US military bases. First, the two guys: Byrne, a writer, and Mehrotra, an engineer, leased satellite imagery from a company called Apollo Mapping for $1,984. Unable to show it publicly, they hosted an event Thursday called "Internal Use Only" where visitors saw the images if they signed paperwork making them temporary employees of a nonprofit that employs Mehrotra. What they saw? Who knows, but Google has now updated Maps with a 2017 image of the test range. The site itself, roughly 70 miles from Area 51, is used to test various weapons and planes and apparently developed the first US "stealth" aircraft, per Jalopnik. Even Google usually has to buy images of military bases from satellite companies due to airspace restrictions, according to Byrne and Mehrotra. (A secret government airline needed someone to fly to Topoah and Area 51.)

Original Story:  – As the sexual assault accusations against Bill Cosby continue to mount, Alan Scherstuhl at the Village Voice makes an interesting observation: Cosby's accusers all have a similar story, that of feeling drugged after having drinks with the comedian, then getting assaulted. "Curiously, Cosby himself once made such scenarios the center of a stand-up routine," Scherstuhl writes. He's talking about "Spanish Fly," from Cosby's 1969 LP, It's True! It's True!. The bit features Cosby recalling how, at 13, he heard about "Spanish fly," a drug that "would make a girl go crazy once it was put into her drink," Scherstuhl writes. Then, "more disturbingly, Cosby ... describes his adult interest in such a drug." (At Gawker, Gabrielle Bluestone notes that Spanish fly is actually "an irritant that's sometimes deadly.") The comedy routine includes the lines, "Any time you see a girl: 'Wish I had some Spanish fly.' Go to a party, see five girls standing alone: 'Boy, if I had a whole jug of Spanish fly, I'd light that corner up over there.'"
Original Summary:  Bill Cosby's stand-up routine from 1969, "Spanish Fly," includes jokes about a drug that can make a girl go crazy once it's put in her drink, which is similar to the allegations made against him by multiple women who have accused him of drugging and assaulting them. Cosby's routine features him recalling his interest in the drug as an adult, despite it being an irritant that can be deadly.

Original Story:  – President Trump has more to say about Robert Mueller's latest moves, and it's in all caps with three exclamation points: "A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning after the FBI's raid on the office of Trump attorney Michael Cohen. He also wrote: "Attorney–client privilege is dead!" Trump previously vented to reporters Monday that the raid is "an attack on our country." Cohen is reportedly under investigation for bank fraud and campaign finance fraud, and while the raid was conducted by the FBI and overseen by the US Attorney's office in Manhattan, it came about after a referral from special counsel Mueller, reports the AP. The president's fury has again raised speculation about whether he will fire the special counsel, and Axios highlights a relevant part of Trump's exchange with reporters on Monday. "Why don't I just fire Mueller?" said Trump, repeating a reporter's question. "Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on. We'll see what happens. But I think it's really a sad situation when you look at what happened. And many people have said, 'You should fire him.'" Cohen is under scrutiny in part for paying porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 late in the campaign to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump, and her attorney predicted "he is going to fold like a cheap deck of cards," per the Hill. "I think that this is the first significant domino to fall," said Michael Avenatti.

Original Story:  – Dinosaurs just got a little more colorful. A batch of prehistoric feathers found in western Canada from about 70 million years ago suggests that feathers on dinosaurs and early birds were more diverse and complex than thought, reports the Los Angeles Times. "Instead of scaly animals portrayed as usually drab creatures, we have solid evidence for a fluffy colored past," Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History in New York tells the AP. The feathers and filaments, found preserved in amber, "display a wide range of pigmentation" and offer "novel insights into feather formation," says lead researcher Ryan McKeller of the University of Alberta. He and his team published their findings in Science, notes the New York Times. It's a "pretty significant find," writes Hans Villarica at the Atlantic (which also has a slide show and much background). "It supports a model for the evolution of feathers that has previously relied on compression fossils that are difficult to interpret and have been hotly debated."

Original Story:  – The new BBC sketch comedy show Revolting didn't wait long before jumping into controversy: Its very first episode featured a Real Housewives of ISIS skit, Rolling Stone reports. It's exactly what you'd expect—a spoof of Bravo's Real Housewives franchise in which the wives of ISIS fighters complain about not having a thing to wear to a beheading, show off their fancy new suicide vests, and rejoice in the fact that the new chain their husband bought to tie them up with is almost long enough to allow them outside. It's proving unsurprisingly controversial. Many commenters on social media complained that the sketch made light of the very real issue of young girls being groomed online and turned into jihadi brides, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Per one commenter: The sketch has "all the fun of an off-base Amy Schumer skit with the same lack of awareness of anything other than itself" and is "only funny if you look down on someone else and enjoy seeing them unhappy because they are not white and Christian." But the show's creators tell the i newspaper that's the exact issue they're trying to highlight. "The target is online grooming. It’s about people who are vulnerable to these kind of approaches," says Jolyon Rubinstein. Adds Heydon Prowse, "It's important not to pull your punches in satire. You have to be fearless or it undermines your credibility. You can't go after David Cameron for five years like we did [on a previous show] and not go after Islamic State."

Original Story:  – Lars Mittank spent the first week of July 2014 with friends at a Bulgarian beach resort. He has spent the nearly four years since as one of YouTube's greatest mysteries. Kirk Pepi has the story at Mel Magazine. Pepi writes that the 28-year-old's holiday with his five former classmates from Itzehoe, Germany, was unremarkable, with two exceptions: His friends noticed he ate very little, and he got in a fight with some other Germans at a McDonald's over rival football teams. His friends had already gone back to the hotel; Mittank says he got punched in the face, and that the force ruptured his eardrum. And so he told friends he had to delay his flight to Hamburg for a day to give his eardrum more time to heal. They left—and things started to get weird. He made whispering phone calls to his mom, saying he was being followed; the hotel's cameras saw him pacing and hiding in an elevator. But he managed to make it to the terminal on the morning of July 8 and went to the airport doctor to get cleared for takeoff. Dr. Kosta Kostov determined he could fly home but noticed Mittank seemed paranoid, doubly so when an airport construction worker walked into the office. Mittank stood up, left his bags behind, and ran—through the terminal and a parking lot, over a barbed-wire fence, and into the woods. Airport surveillance footage of his exit has been watched some 16 million times via video compilations of odd mysteries, writes Pepi, who calls him "maybe the most famous missing person on YouTube." And he remains missing. Read the full story for more on the private investigator Mittank's mom hired.

Original Story:  – An eviction hearing for a formal tribal chairwoman ended in a hail of bullets yesterday at the Cedarville Rancheria American Indian tribal office in California. Alturas police say Cherie Lash Rhoades, also known as Sherie Lash, opened fire at around 3:30pm, shooting six people and killing four of them, KRCR reports. When she was out of bullets, she allegedly ran into the kitchen, grabbed a butcher knife and stabbed one of her victims again. One blood-drenched witness escaped and ran to get police. Police say they found Rhoades outside, running with the knife still in her hands. A Rancheria employee helped tackle her, the Redding Record Searchlight reports. The two surviving victims were flown to the hospital. Rhoades allegedly killed two women, ages 19 and 45, and two men, 30 and 50, during the rampage.

Original Story:  – When scientists from the University of Illinois and Canada's Simon Fraser University headed to northern Canada last August to do some fieldwork along the Slims River, they were met by a surprising sight. The Yukon river was no longer flowing and instead resembled a "long, skinny lake," researcher Daniel Shugar says, per Phys.org. The reason, as they now explain in a study published in the Nature Geoscience journal: The waterway had become a victim of "river piracy," in this case caused by the retreat of the Kaskawulsh Glacier, which in turn caused the meltwater to completely change its northward course toward the Bering Sea (via the Slims, then Kluane Lake and the Yukon River) and instead merge with the Kaskawulsh River, which flows south to the Gulf of Alaska—and what the Guardian calls the "abrupt" vanishing of the Slims seems to have happened over just four days last spring. Those four days—May 26 to May 29—showed a sudden drop in the Slims' flow, with Shugar saying comparable river piracy hasn't, to his knowledge, been seen in our lifetimes. The glacier is said to have retreated nearly 2,300 feet in the 50-year period between 1956 and 2007, and in 2016, the rapid pace of the meltwater's movement created an ice channel that directed more water toward the Kaskawulsh River, a tributary of the Alsek River that dumps into the gulf. The glacier's decline is being blamed with 99.5% probability on climate change, and scientists say the new development will affect local wildlife, fish populations, and water chemistry, among other things. "I always point out to climate-change skeptics that Earth's glaciers are becoming markedly smaller, and that can only happen in a warming climate," co-author John Clague says, per Phys.org. (Breathtaking photos show glacier melt.)

"I always point out to climate-change skeptics that Earth's glaciers are becoming markedly smaller, and that can only happen in a warming climate," co-author John Clague says, per Phys.org. (Breathtaking photos show glacier melt.)
Injected Summary:  Scientists from the University of Illinois and Simon Fraser University observed the Slims River in northern Canada change from flowing to being a "long, skinny lake" due to the retreat of the Kaskawulsh Glacier, which caused the meltwater to change course and merge with the Kaskawulsh River, a tributary of the Alsek River that flows into the Gulf of Alaska. The glaciers decline is being blamed on climate change with 99.5% probability, and the new development will affect local wildlife, fish populations, and water chemistry, among other things.

Original Story:  – A former Playboy model who says she slept with President Trump can now say it all she wants—in even greater detail. Karen McDougal settled her lawsuit Wednesday with the tabloid company American Media Inc. on terms that let her fully discuss the alleged affair, the New York Times reports. "It's a total win," says her lawyer Peter Stris. "We got everything we were fighting for—she got out of the contract, gets the life rights back and owes AMI nothing more." An elated McDougal says she's doing a "victory dance" but has no immediate plans. "I am relieved to be able to tell the truth about my story when asked," she says in a statement per CBS News. McDougal sold her Trump-story rights to AMI for $150,000 in 2016, but later sued the company, saying chairman David Pecker misled her and Trump personal lawyer Michael Cohen got inappropriately involved. AMI appeared ready to fight McDougal until the feds raided Cohen's office earlier this month and seized information on her lawsuit and AMI, per insiders in the case. Wednesday's settlement grants AMI up to $75,000 in future profits from McDougal's story and protects Trump from legal responsibility regarding attempts to buy women's stories during the presidential campaign. Trump still denies having had an affair with McDougal.

Original Story:  – A French sailor has just destroyed the world record for the fastest time around the world on a solo voyage. Thomas Coville reached the finish line in the English Channel precisely 49 days, 3 hours, 7 minutes, and 38 seconds after he started out, reports France24. That beats the mark set by his countryman Francis Joyon in 2008 by more than eight days. His record-breaking time means that Coville probably slept no more than 30 minutes at a time in his 105-foot trimaran. The sub-50-day time is "incredible," says a post at Yachting World, while a post at Sail-World has images of the journey.

Original Story:  – The routine part of this shoplifting story out of Miami is that police stopped a woman trying to leave a supermarket with $300 worth of unpaid-for food. The not-so-routine part: Upon hearing that the accused was a mother of three in dire straits, the arresting officer went back in the store and shelled out $100 from her own pocket to buy the woman groceries, reports WSVN. "I made the decision to buy her some groceries because arresting her wasn't going to solve the problem with her children being hungry," says officer Vicki Thomas. She still charged Jessica Robles with a misdemeanor, but she also educated her about local food banks and other sources of help. "She asked, 'Do you even have food at the house?' And I looked at her in her face, and I told her, 'Not at all,'" recalls Robles. For the record, the Miami-Dade department has no problem with Thomas' actions. "Police officers do have discretion, and what Thomas did was completely in bounds," a spokesperson tells AOL.
Original Summary:  A police officer in Miami went beyond the call of duty by using her own money to buy groceries for a mother of three who was caught shoplifting $300 worth of food.

The 41-year-old was first elected in 2009 and had announced that he would not stand for re-election this year, reports the Charlotte Observer, prompting rumors that he was headed for an Obama Cabinet gig. His transportation resume includes a streetcar project and airport expansion, officials say.

Original Story:  – The Justice Department intends to file a lawsuit against Texas over a voter ID law that it contends violates the 14th and 15th Amendments, along with what's left of the Voting Rights Act. The government will essentially argue that the ID law is intentionally attempting to restrict minority access to voting—which, the AP points out, could prove tricky since, unlike other parts of the VRA, it's not enough to simply prove that the effect of the law would be discriminatory. The Supreme Court recently voided the list of locations subject to the VRA's oversight. But the Justice Department is also jumping into a separate lawsuit over Texas' redistricting and arguing that it, too, is intentionally discriminatory, and that Texas should be subjected to preclearance of its electoral maps once again, the Washington Post reports. "We will not allow the Supreme Court’s recent decision to be interpreted as open season for states to pursue measures that suppress voting rights," Eric Holder said.

Original Story:  – It was in early morning darkness that officers scrambled to sort out the chaos at an Albuquerque apartment complex where a couple had reportedly been attacked, the woman bleeding from a head injury and the man with a black eye and wearing blood-stained shorts. The woman told officers her 10-year-old daughter was still inside apartment number 808 from which they had escaped. What the officers didn't know was that the child was already dead, her battered and dismembered body partially wrapped in a blanket and set ablaze. With the fire alarm blaring, they busted in the front door and searched the smoke-filled apartment for Victoria Martens. In the bathroom, the real crime began to come into focus, the AP reports. Investigators took into custody the girl's mother, her boyfriend, and his cousin. The community was left struggling to understand how a blossoming elementary school student who loved swimming and gymnastics could have been the target of such violence. Details of what New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and law enforcement officials described as an unspeakable crime emerged in a criminal complaint made public Thursday. Police said Victoria was injected with methamphetamine, sexually assaulted, strangled, and stabbed before being dismembered Wednesday—her 10th birthday. The girl's mother, 35-year-old Michelle Martens, her 31-year-old boyfriend, Fabian Gonzales, and his 31-year-old cousin, Jessica Kelley, face charges of child abuse resulting in death, kidnapping, and tampering with evidence. Gonzales and Kelley also face charges of criminal sexual penetration of a minor. Martens told police she met Gonzales online about a month ago and that he drugged the girl so he could calm her down and have sex with her, the complaint says. Per KOB, Martens says Gonzales then strangled the girl and Kelley stabbed her in the chest.

Original Story:  – The South Carolina single mom arrested for letting her 9-year-old daughter play in a park while she worked at McDonald's has been given her daughter back—but has lost her job. The lawyer representing Debra Harrell pro bono says McDonald's has let her go, but he isn't sure why, reports ThinkProgress. A McDonald's spokeswoman declined to comment. Harrell has been charged with unlawful neglect of a child, and her lawyer says that although she has been reunited with her daughter, the Department of Social Services probe is ongoing. According to the blog Reason, Harrell had been bringing her daughter to work and letting her play on a laptop, but she started dropping her off at a nearby park while she worked after their home was broken into and the laptop was stolen. The lawyer tells CNN he thinks it's "absurd" to say the girl was "abandoned" at the park a few minutes' walk from her house. "Because if this woman gets convicted, guess what? ... From now on, do officers now have an obligation every time they see a 9-and-a-half-year-old not in the presence of their parents, do the parents get arrested?" he says. "It truly is the classic slippery slope." Amid public outcry over the case, a fundraising page set up to help Harrell has received more than $31,000 in donations.

Original Story:  – A small new study offers an intriguing clue about the baffling ailment known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Researchers in the UK say CFS, also known by its more scientific name of myalgic encephalomyelitis, appears to be triggered by an overactive immune system, reports the Guardian. Those who have CFS—including Seabiscuit and Unbroken author Laura Hillenbrand—suffer not just debilitating fatigue, but headaches, nausea, vertigo, and other symptoms that leave them unable to complete even the most basic tasks. The study suggests that sufferers may have an immune system that is genetically predisposed to go into hyper-drive when a virus or infection shows up, reports CNN. When it does, the cascade of debilitating—and easily misdiagnosed—symptoms begins. If the researchers are right, it could be a big first step on a poorly understood ailment. "This is a light in the fog, a direction of travel," says King's College London researcher Carmine Pariante, per the BBC. "Although screening is a long way off, our results are the first step in identifying those at risk and catching the illness in its crucial early stages." The study involved 55 people with hepatitis C who were given the standard treatment of the drug interferon-alpha. This treatment typically produces symptoms consistent with CFS, and the researchers measured levels of a protein linked to inflammation in participants' blood before, during, and afterward. Eighteen people had a particularly strong immune reaction to the treatment—including fatigue—and they also had higher levels of the suspect protein before the treatment began.

Original Story:  – Tag-team hurricanes Iselle and Julio will thrash Hawaii in a one-two punch that starts tonight—the first time in 22 years the islands have been directly hit. Category 1 Iselle is expected to maintain 85 mph winds when it makes landfall on the Big Island tonight. It’s "not a major hurricane, but definitely enough to blow things around," a meteorologist tells the AP; up to 8 inches of rain is expected. Iselle should weaken as it passes through the island's volcanic terrain into tomorrow morning. Just behind Iselle, Julio is a bit fiercer Category 2, with winds estimated at 100 mph; it'll pick up speed before weakening tonight and hit Sunday as a tropical storm, reports NBC News. The last hurricane to hit Hawaii was Iniki in 1992, which killed six people. Vacations are being disrupted by the storms. Island Air has canceled flights to Maui and Lanai, the Washington Post reports. Hawaiian Airlines will decide today whether to follow suit, adds the Hawaii Tribune-Herald; on the ground, state parks are closed and beachgoers are enjoying the last shreds of nice weather. One Boston resident booked his two-week Maui and Big Island vacation last year and has been eagerly watching weather reports. "We're all optimists, so we'll make the best of it," he tells the AP. Weather officials had warned this season would be an active one in the region, with up to seven tropical storms—probably due in no small part to El Nino.

Original Story:  – Bernie Sanders was right when he claimed that supposedly neutral Democratic National Committee officials had a strong pro-Hillary bias, according emails WikiLeaks has released just ahead of the party's convention. In some of the almost 20,000 emails put online Friday, top DNC officials mock the Sanders campaign and suggest ways of creating anti-Sanders narratives for the media, the New York Times reports. In one exchange, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz dismisses Sanders' chances when discussing a CNN story about his promise to oust her if elected president. "This is a silly story," she wrote. "He isn't going to be president." In other emails, officials describe the Vermont senator's campaign as "a mess." In another exchange, DNC CFO Brad Marshall talks about bringing up the religious beliefs of an unnamed person who sounds a lot like Sanders. "It might may [sic] no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief," Marshall writes. "Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist." The Washington Post reports that the leaked emails, which can be viewed and searched here, also include plenty of details about the party's internal operations, including the convention perks provided to big donors.

Original Story:  – Three men were arrested for an alleged shooting that took place about an hour after white nationalist Richard Spencer's University of Florida speech ended Thursday, and Gainesville police say the men yelled "Heil Hitler" before shots were fired. Tyler Tenbrink and brothers Colton and William Fears, all from Texas, have been charged with attempted homicide, CBS 4 reports. The three had spoken to the media supporting Spencer and his views hours before the shooting; police say after the speech ended, they were in a Jeep and started making Nazi salutes and shouting at people near a bus stop who were holding anti-Nazi signs, the AP reports. One of the victims hit the Jeep's back window with a baton, after which it stopped and the Fears brothers, threatening to kill the protesters, allegedly urged Tenbrink to shoot, which he allegedly did. The shot hit a nearby building, and police say the three suspects then drove away. They were picked up later after victims called police and gave their license plate number. Police say Tenbrink admitted to shooting; he is also charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. They also say at least two of the men have connections to extremist groups. (Ohio State on Friday denied a request from Spencer to speak at the school.)

Original Story:  – ProPublica has wrapped up a two-part investigation into the very subjective world of presidential pardons, and one thing is not so subjective anymore: If you are white and happen to know someone in Congress, your chances of getting a pardon just went way up: Minority odds: Part one of the investigation rests on a central fact: White people have been four times as likely as minorities over the past decade to land a pardon. Blacks fare the worst of any minority. "I'm just astounded by those numbers," says the official who led the Justice Department's pardons office from 1998 to 2008. Read the full piece here. Who you know: Part two finds that nearly 200 members of Congress have personally written on behalf of a pardon-seeker since 2000. And while that doesn't guarantee success, it clearly makes a difference: Those with a lawmaker's support were three times as likely to succeed. A Justice Department spokesman says congressional influence plays no role in the process, but the former department honcho quoted in part one notes, “If the official does know the person, it gives it some weight.” Read the full piece here.

Original Story:  – The UK today announced "the immediate closure" of Iran's embassy in London following yesterday's invasion of the British embassy in Tehran—and it's not the only embassy to close. The AP reports that Norway has elected to shutter its embassy in the Iranian capital over security concerns. A foreign ministry rep explains that the decision "is in context with the attack on the British embassy yesterday." In the UK, British Foreign Secretary William Hague has given Iranian diplomats 48 hours to exit and also blasted the Iranian government, the Wall Street Journal reports. "The idea that the Iranian authorities could not have protected our embassy or that this assault could have taken place without some degree of regime consent is fanciful," he said. British personnel have been pulled from Tehran; "it is not possible to maintain an embassy under these circumstance and these threats and actions," explained Hague.

Original Story:  – The relationship between Duran Duran and one of its major fan clubs has officially come undone: The pop group that crooned such iconic ‘80s hits as “Rio” and “Hungry Like the Wolf” filed a lawsuit Monday against Chicago-based Worldwide Fan Clubs, which runs a Duran Duran fan club, claiming the organization breached its contract with Le Bon and Co. and owes the band $40,000 in damages, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. According to the 2010 contract, Worldwide agreed to establish and manage the DD fan club, which included collecting fees from members, keeping records on said fans, and warehousing and selling Duran Duran merchandise. For its efforts, the fan club would keep 25% of the take, with the remaining 75% going to Duran Duran, but the suit claims the band didn't get the agreed-upon revenue. The Sun-Times says that a company rep wasn’t available for comment on Tuesday, while the AP reports "someone who answered the phone" at Worldwide’s headquarters yesterday said the company had no comment.
Original Summary:  Duran Duran has sued their longtime fan club, Worldwide Fan Clubs, for breaching their contract and failing to pay the band $40,000 in damages.

Original Story:  – The American intelligence community had concluded Russia is to blame for cyberattacks during the US election, including those targeting Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange disagrees. And in a move one Republican political consultant sees as "mocking American men and women who … put their lives on the line for us," Donald Trump is siding with the latter, reports the New York Times. In a tweet Wednesday, Trump repeated claims Assange made on Fox News on Tuesday, reports USA Today: "Julian Assange said 'a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta' - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!" The tweet didn't go over well, including with members of his own party. "Let's stare this reality square in the face: PEOTUS is pro-Putin and believes Julian Assange over the @CIA. On Jan. 20 we will be less safe," tweeted former Pentagon and CIA spokesman George Little in response, per CNN. "I have a lot more faith in our intelligence officers … than I do in people like Julian Assange," added Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, per Politico. House Speaker Paul Ryan didn't address Trump's tweet, but did call Assange "a sycophant for Russia" and suggested Trump would become "better informed" once Friday's intelligence briefing about Russian hacking occurred. Trump on Tuesday night tweeted the meeting was "delayed" to Friday, suggesting the reason was "more time needed to build a case." Intelligence officials, however, say the meeting was always planned for Friday.

Original Story:  – One out of every 10 organic-food sales is made at Costco, the Seattle Times reports—enough to propel the warehouse club to estimated annual sales of $4 billion and allow it to beat out Whole Foods ($3.6 billion) as the No. 1 organic grocer, per an analysis from BMO Capital Markets cited on the TakePart website. Costco's numbers were revealed in an earnings call with CFO Richard Galanti last week, who noted that Costco's sales of organic have doubled over the past couple of years. What this means, the Times notes, is that organic is moving from just being on the shelves of specialty venues to mainstream sellers—and right into the sights of the younger "millennial" generation. So while Costco's relatively new tack may seem surprising—as TheStreet's Jim Cramer puts it, the news is "quite a change from when management of Costco admitted to me just a few years ago that they thought it was a fad that would go away"—it's probably just the start, with retailers like Walmart not far behind, per the Times.

Original Story:  – In Pawn Sacrifice, Tobey Maguire plays troubled American chess prodigy Bobby Fischer, who will eventually battle Russian chess master Boris Spassky at the 1972 World Chess Championship. But can any actor really get inside Fischer's head? Here's what critics are saying: Richard Roeper sums up the film as "Rocky III at the chess table—if Rocky were an increasingly paranoid loner." Overall, it's "enthralling," "captures the essence of Fischer's mad genius, perfectly recreates the tenor of the times AND works as a legit sports movie about the great game of chess," he writes at the Chicago Sun-Times. Plus, "Maguire gives the performance of his career," and "Liev Schreiber deserves best supporting actor consideration" for his turn as Spassky. The film "doesn't offer much in the way of surprises or insight," and "never fully captures how Fischer became Fischer," but "there's much to recommend it anyway," writes Keith Phipps at Uproxx. "It's shot handsomely and builds in intensity." There are also "some sharp lines from screenwriter Steven Knight and first-rate performances." Schreiber is good, but Maguire steals the show. Jesse Hassenger at AV Club says "it's a fitfully entertaining and well-acted movie" but "doesn’t quite come together." Though "one of the film's strongest, most potentially surprising pleasures is the sight of Maguire playing both with and against his usual type," Hassenger says the film "struggles to wring much drama" out of a 24-game chess series. The lengthy postscript also seems a bit off. Joe Neumaier admits the movie isn't perfect. "The overall intelligence and strategy of the story is occasionally disturbed by moments of obvious movie bluster or emotional trickery. But that's easy to forgive," he writes at the New York Daily News. "The challenge of Pawn Sacrifice was to capture the colorful Cold War '70s, the inner strategies of one man's paranoid mind, and make chess cinematic. Check, and mate." This is Maguire's "best performance since Wonder Boys." (Is this 12-year-old the next Bobby Fischer?)

Original Story:  – A court commissioner on Monday issued a temporary restraining order against Rob Kardashian in response to the reality television star's posting of explicit images of ex-fiancee Blac Chyna on social media last week. The order will remain in effect until an Aug. 8 hearing; Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner James E. Blancarte said his primary concern was the former couple's infant baby, who was not listed in Chyna's requests for a protective order. Blancarte sealed exhibits in the case, citing their explicit nature. Chyna's attorney Lisa Bloom said after the hearing that the restraining order prevents Kardashian from posting anything about her client online and orders him to stay away from her. Bloom said in court that the pair has nannies to handle custody transfers while the restraining order is in place. Kardashian did not appear at Monday's hearing. "We apologize and have offered our regrets for what has taken place in the last few days," his lawyer, Robert Shapiro, said outside the courthouse. He said the former couple remains focused on their daughter, who he said is currently being cared for by Kardashian. "I want to (get) back to co-parenting Dream," Chyna said outside the courthouse. TMZ references additional filings made by Bloom that allege an incident of domestic violence in April, during which Kardashian allegedly punched Chyna and then punched a hole through her bedroom door in an attempt to get to her. TMZ also quotes sources who say Chyna tired to choke Kardashian with an iPhone cord in December. Chyna gave an interview to Good Morning America that aired Monday; in it, she discusses her initial attraction to Kardashian.

Original Story:  – The captain of the El Faro planned to sail ahead of Hurricane Joaquin, but the cargo ship was doomed by a mechanical failure that left it at the mercy of the storm, according to the vessel's owner. The CEO of Tote Services says the captain, who was last heard from on Thursday morning, had determined that the weather was good enough to follow a sister ship's path back to Jacksonville, Fla., the AP reports. "Regrettably he suffered a mechanical problem with his main propulsion system, which left him in the path of the storm," the CEO says. "We do not know when his engine problems began to occur, nor the reasons for his engine problems." The Coast Guard believes the ship, with a crew of 28 Americans and five Poles, sank in 15,000 feet of water near the Bahamas. Mariners tell the AP that the ship would probably have been able to make it through the worst of the storm if it had engine power, but without it, it would have been helpless and even abandoning ship would have been extremely difficult. Such disasters are extremely rare, reports the Atlantic. Until the El Faro, more Boeing 777s had been lost at sea than large cargo ships over the last five years, and, amid a huge volume of maritime traffic, only six were lost in the decade from 2005, although dozens more ran aground or sank with some warning. Searchers are now looking for survivors instead of the ship itself, though all they have found so far is debris and a survival suit with "unidentifiable" human remains.
Original Summary:  The El Faro, a cargo ship with a crew of 33, was doomed by a mechanical failure that left it vulnerable to Hurricane Joaquin. Despite the captain's decision to sail ahead of the storm, the ship suffered an engine failure, making it unable to escape the storm's path.

Original Story:  – Nissan is calling back about a million of its 2013 and 2014 vehicles: Thanks to a software issue, the passenger airbag may not expand during an accident. The problem is related to the car not recognizing that there is a passenger in the seat, the Los Angeles Times explains. Affected models are the Altima, Sentra, Leaf, Pathfinder, and NV200, as well as the Infiniti JX35, Q50, and QX60. The company is aware of accidents but no fatalities tied to the issue. Some of the same batch of vehicles were recalled last year, also due to passenger air bag problems, USA Today notes. The news comes as GM and Toyota are embroiled in safety concerns of their own.
Original Summary:  Nissan is recalling over a million vehicles from 2013 and 2014 due to a software issue that may prevent the passenger airbag from deploying in the event of an accident.

Original Story:  – A mother is locked in a battle with an Alabama school district over whether her son should be allowed to die at school. Rene Hoover's 14-year-old son, Alex, has a terminal heart condition that has narrowed his mitral valve. The AP reports that has hampered his blood flow, a situation exacerbated by his growth. Alex was hospitalized multiple times over the summer, and WHNT reported last month that the family's doctors feel the best choice for Alex from a quality-of-life perspective would be to let him die naturally. The teen has hospice care twice a week, according to DecaturDaily.com, and his family obtained a legal advance directive stating Alex is not to be revived if he goes into cardiac arrest. There's only one problem: East Limestone High School refuses to honor the advance directive and has said it will do everything it can to save the teen if something happens while he's at school. Alex hasn't gone back to school since his hospitalizations, though he is physically up for attending class four hours a week. WAFF reports Hoover isn't permitted to stay with Alex while he's at school (which would allow her to make medical choices for him) due to policies regarding how much time parents can spend on campus. "His entire life would be medications, surgeries," she says of resuscitating him. "This is about doing the right thing for him and letting him enjoy what time he has left." One bioethics expert isn't so sure, telling the AP he isn't convinced Alex, who has autism, had the capacity to issue the advance directive. There are also concerns that his death could traumatize other students. The state's education department doesn't have a policy on advance directives. Hoover is currently working with a state legislator to change that. In the meantime, Alex remains at home. (This school is involved in a controversy over prayer.)

Original Story:  – A new National Enquirer cover story says Tom Cruise "abused" Katie Holmes and forced Suri to spend months in a "tiny, windowless room"—and Cruise's lawyers are furious. They say the story is filled with "disgusting lies" and are threatening to sue the tabloid over the "disgraceful and lurid" piece, says the Hollywood Reporter. The lawyers will hold its publisher "and everyone who participated in the perpetuation of this scurrilous attack jointly and severally liable" for "hundreds of millions of dollars of professional and personal damages," they write in a letter to American Media. The legal team wrote an email to the publisher on Tuesday, before the issue came out, demanding it halt its publication of "the most defamatory cover the Enquirer has ever done." When that didn't happen, the lawyers wrote a cease-and-desist letter, calling on the tabloid to prominently "retract each and every one of your false allegations." (See THR for a copy of the letter.) Lawyers also reject the notion that Cruise settled the divorce because he was hiding secrets. See TMZ for more on that.

Original Story:  – How did word of the NSA's massive Internet and phone surveillance programs leak to the press? We don't know much, but it looks like the story comes from one or more insiders who object to the government's actions. Here's what we know: Tucked at the end of its piece on the PRISM program, the Washington Post identifies its source as a "career intelligence officer" with "firsthand experience" with PRISM and "horror at [its] capabilities." Said the source, "They quite literally can watch your ideas form as you type." Glenn Greenwald, who broke both stories for the Guardian, tells the New York Times that his source is "a reader of mine," who "knew the views that I had and had an expectation of how I would display them." It's not clear from his comments if that reader was the source for both stories. Greenwald, for those unfamiliar, is a Guardian blogger known for railing against the surveillance state and being in favor of civil liberties. He's now expected to fall under a Justice Department investigation of his own, the Times reports. He also says that he considered releasing the info without the Guardian, because, as a frequent defender of Bradley Manning, he believes journalists should be protected even without an established publisher behind them.

Original Story:  – Three people at a northern Virginia military base have been transported to a medical facility and are in stable condition after a suspicious piece of mail was opened and nearly a dozen people felt ill, the AP reports. A spokeswoman for Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall says people in the office on the Marine Corps side of the base said that as soon as the mail was opened they began feeling poorly and complaining of sore throats. CNN reports some people experienced a burning sensation in their hands and face and one person had a nose bleed. Leah Rubalcaba says 11 people were initially assessed, and three were transported for medical care. The Arlington County Fire Department says on Twitter that the three are stable and the investigation is ongoing. The Marine Corps says the building was evacuated, and several Marines are receiving medical care.
